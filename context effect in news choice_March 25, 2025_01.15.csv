This project is conducted by Dr. Bence Bago at Tilburg University. Your contribution to this research is highly valued and appreciated. On this page, we give important information about this study. Please read this carefully and ask any questions, before agreeing to participate.



Purpose

The purpose of this study is to investigate the psychological and environmental factors behind engagement with information online. 



Nature and duration of the study

We kindly request you to complete a questionnaire which should take about 15 minutes of your time (including reading texts). 



You will be asked about your age, gender, and nationality, without any identifying information (i.e. you will not be asked your name or email address). The questionnaire will involve generic questions related to new-age technology and you will be asked to provide your views to the questions. Then you are shown a topical text that you have to read and briefly summarize. The questions are short and will not require detailed recall. In the rare event that you experience any stress, please be aware that you can reach the principal investigators of this study via the email address provided below. 



It’s important to note that your participation is entirely voluntary and that your data will be non-identifiable and will not be associated with any personal/contact information.
