If granted work authorization, the tax contribution by the group would increase by nearly 42%, from $96.7 billion to $136.9 billion, says the new study released Tuesday by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Immigrants lacking legal status in Utah contributed some $235.1 million in state and local taxes in 2022, the report says. The figure would increase by 24.4% to $292.5 million if they received work authorization. \"The bottom line here is that regardless of immigration status, we all contribute by paying our taxes,\" Marco Guzman, senior policy analyst for ITEP and co-author of the study, said in a statement. The \"economic ripple effects\" of the population, ITEP said, \"would likely reveal undocumented immigrants to have an even larger significance to public revenues than is documented here.\" Nevertheless, the new report from the non-profit, Washington, D.C.-based tax policy organization is hardly the only take on the topic. It is the focus of intense debate as U.S. lawmakers try to get a handle on illegal border crossings into the country via Mexico. The Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that views immigration issues through a more conservative lens, says immigrants lacking legal status are \"a net drain\" on the U.S. economy. Yes, they pay taxes, but one researcher told a U.S. House subcommittee in January the cost of government benefits immigrants tap into surpasses their contributions, resulting in a \"fiscal drain\" of around $68,000 per immigrant who lacks legal status, over the course of their life. \"Illegal immigrants have a negative fiscal impact \u2014 taxes paid minus benefits received \u2014 primarily because a large share have modest levels of education, resulting in relatively low average incomes and tax payments, along with significant use of means-tested programs and other government services,\" Steven Camarota, the CIS director of research, said in testimony to a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee on immigration on Jan. 11. Still, even the well-researched contentions from the center don't offer a neat-and-tidy end to debate on the thorny issue. The $68,000 figure is an extrapolation of data from a 2017 study on the fiscal impact of all immigrants, authorized or not, by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Contrary to the Center for Immigration Studies' determination, the 2017 study summary offered an upbeat assessment of the economic impact of immigrants, at least over the long haul. \"First-generation immigrants are more costly to governments than are the native-born, but the second generation are among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S. This report concludes that immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.,\" it states. Tax revenue coming in The new study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates undocumented immigrants paid $59.4 billion in taxes to the federal government in 2022 and $37.3 billion to state and local governments, accounting for the estimated $96.7 billion total. \"In other words, for every 1 million undocumented immigrants who reside in the country, public services receive $8.9 billion in additional tax revenue,\" the study reads. The collective contribution amounted to 26.1% of the population's overall income in 2022 \u2014 on par with the 26.4% figure for median-income earners in the country. Social Security taxes accounted for the largest chunk of funds paid to the feds, totaling $25.7 billion. Sales and excise taxes on purchases accounted for the biggest chunk of local and state taxes paid, some $15.1 billion, the report said. Granting \"work authorization\" \u2014 a controversial notion \u2014 would boost the $96.7 billion figure to $136.9 billion \"both because their wages would rise and because their rates of tax compliance would increase,\" the institution reports. The report doesn't provide an estimate of the value of government services tapped by immigrants who don't have work authorization. The Center for Immigration Studies, by contrast, put a big focus on the area. \"Based on government data, we estimate that 59% of households headed by illegal immigrants use one or more major welfare programs, compared to 39% of households headed by the U.S.-born,\" Camarota said in the report. The center's figures, though, include benefits and services going to U.S. citizens \u2014 the U.S.-born children of those without work authorization. \"The high use of welfare by illegal-immigrant-headed households is due to several factors. First, and most important, more than half of all illegal immigrant households have at least one U.S.-born child on behalf of whom they can receive benefits,\" Camarota said in his testimony. Camarota also noted that some states offer Medicaid benefits to some immigrants without work authorization and that \"illegal immigrant children\" can get free and subsidized lunches at public schools.",
        "summary": "A new study by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that immigrants without legal status paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022. If granted work authorization, their tax contribution would increase by 42% to $136.9 billion. In Utah, immigrants without legal status contributed $235.1 million in state and local taxes in 2022, which would increase by 24.4% to $292.5 million with work authorization. The study found that the economic impact of undocumented immigrants would likely be even larger than documented. The Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative research organization, disagrees, saying that immigrants without legal status are a \"net drain\" on the US economy. According to CIS, the cost of government benefits used by immigrants exceeds their tax contributions, resulting in a \"fiscal drain\" of around $68,000 per immigrant over their lifetime. However, the CIS figure is based on a 2017 study that found immigrants have an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the US. The ITEP study found that undocumented immigrants paid $59.4 billion in federal taxes and $37.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022. Social Security taxes accounted for the largest chunk of federal taxes paid, while sales and excise taxes accounted for the largest chunk of state and local taxes. Granting work authorization would increase tax revenue due to increased wages and tax compliance."

Significantly more Americans name immigration as the most important problem facing the U.S. according to a Gallup poll in June. However, there\u2019s a lot of disinformation fueling unfounded \u201cimmigration antagonism.\u201d  We\u2019ve seen this on the debate stage, and when candidates and TV pundits speak with hostility offering up a myriad of disinformation about immigrants. Facts may help dispel some of these slanderous opinions. One of the nastiest lies is falsely smearing immigrants as criminals. Immigrants, regardless of citizenship status, are 60% less likely to be incarcerated for committing crimes than U.S.-born citizens, according to research by Stanford economist Ran Abramitzky. Immigration opponents claim immigrants are a drain on the economy and on government resources. False. Immigrants are particularly ambitious and hardworking. They are 80% more likely to start a new business than U.S.-born citizens. Research by the American Immigration Council finds that nearly half of today\u2019s Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or the children of immigrants, including four of the top 12 companies. Impressively, immigrant-founded businesses comprise 103 companies in last year\u2019s Fortune 500. Silicon Valley companies employ thousands of immigrants who have been highly successful, working as entrepreneurs and employees in technology. Including, creating lifesaving robotics used in surgeries worldwide. Many of these migrants are critical to our health. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2021 American Community Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that immigrants account for more than 26% of physicians and surgeons. Forty percent of personal care aides are immigrants as are about a fifth of nursing assistants. Approximately, 1.6 million immigrants are working as doctors, registered nurses, dentists, pharmacists or dental hygienists. According to Phil Swagel, the director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, estimates that new immigrants will add about $7 trillion dollars to America\u2019s economy over the next decade. This includes about $1 trillion in tax revenues that will help shrink, not grow, the deficit. The libertarian Cato Institute found that new immigrants pay $1.38 in taxes for every dollar of benefits they receive. U.S. born residents pay around 69 cents for every dollar of benefits they receive. Another common anti-newcomer misconception is that immigrants are taking away jobs. Immigrants are not taking away jobs that Americans want. Undocumented immigrants in particular are doing some of the most dangerous, difficult, low-paying and essential jobs in the country, while the U.S. enjoys record-low unemployment. Young migrants will play a large role to help keep Social Security strong, as the nation ages and the Baby Boomers move into retirement. Immigrants add immeasurably to the richness of American culture. We need immigrants to keep our economy, and our country, vibrant and growing. Yes, we need to develop comprehensive immigration reform and, please, also remember that immigration policy covers newcomers from every country outside the U.S. In an election year when immigration is a partisan issue, we should remember the profound difference immigrants have made and continue to make in our lives. They are not \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d They\u2019re revitalizing and restoring it. Be an educated voter. From the timeless words of Thomas Jefferson: \u201cWe do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.\u201d Please, make a plan to vote.

This is when J1 visa-holders, often young Irish people, are in town. The J1 visa program allows young people to work and travel in the US for a few months. Many Irish students take advantage of this program to spend their summer breaks in the US. Chicago is a popular destination for these visa-holders due to its strong Irish heritage. The city's Irish roots are evident in its many Irish pubs and cultural events. During the summer, the city's Irish population swells with young people from Ireland. They come to Chicago to work, socialize, and experience American culture. This influx of young Irish people brings a lively energy to the city's Irish neighborhoods. For a few months, Chicago is even more Irish than usual, thanks to the J1 visa-holders."

        "text": "The US economy will keep growing and ultimately avoid a recession thanks to artificial intelligence, immigration, and rich people. That's according to State Street chief investment strategist Michael Arone, who said in a recent note that even as the Federal Reserve keeps monetary policy in restrictive territory via high interest rates, that won't be enough to send the economy into a tailspin. \"The risks are growing that the stubborn Fed gradually then suddenly puts the economy in recession,\" he said. \"But the economy may narrowly escape the dreaded recession outcome for these three reasons.\" Even though AI technologies are in the early innings, Arone says they hold a lot of promise for boosting economic productivity, increasing company profits, and igniting further growth for businesses. \"Recent studies assert that AI can improve productivity across a wide range of jobs by 20% to 80%. That compares favorably to another general-purpose technology, steam power,\" he said. Arone notes that steam power sparked the Industrial Revolution, and that technology increased productivity by just 18% to 22% when it was installed in factories. If AI can improve productivity by a multiple of that, it could unlock significant economic benefits in the future \u2014 and those benefits should more than outweigh any policy mistake by the Fed, Arone said. Americans can thank immigrants for the continued progress in battling inflation, according to Arone. \"Many people underappreciated the role that increasing immigration has played in stabilizing the post-pandemic labor market without further flattering inflationary pressures,\" he said. Wage inflation soared during the early days of the pandemic, which stoked overall inflation to a cycle peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But the influx of more than 1.5 million immigrants in 2023 helped balance out supply and demand in the labor market, Arone said. \"The pace of immigration increases over the past couple of years is consistent with past economic expansions. And, with job openings remaining elevated in immigrant-dependent service industries, participation rates are likely to increase over the next two years, further boosting the labor market,\" he said. Arone also notes that the increase in immigrants can have a compounding impact on the US economy overtime. He says while this set of workers will typically take low-skill service jobs upon their arrival in the country, some of them will become entrepreneurs and stoke innovation, consumption, and fiscal contributions. For all the concerns about rising delinquency rates and more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, Arone says the high-income cohort of the US population is in strong financial shape. He says that's important because people who earn $150,000 or more are responsible for a 40% of US consumer spending. \"They own 85% of stocks, 80% of bonds, and two-thirds of liquid assets. Yet, they only make up about one-third of consumer credit card balances,\" Arone said, citing data from Empirical Research Partners. This demographic is on pace to see their wages grow 5% this year, and they are expected to increase their spending by 8% this year, which could be even higher if inflation continues to fall and stock and home prices continue to rise, Arone said. \"In a departure from past periods, higher stock and home prices combined with a significant increase in their interest income has enabled top earners to spend solidly throughout this tighter monetary policy cycle,\" he said. Taken together, this suggests to Arone that the US economy is on track for solid growth in the coming quarters and will ultimately avoid a recession, and that should enable a continued rise in the stock market. \"A restrictive Fed won't stop the music this time around because the economy's moving to a new rhythm,\" he said.

        "summary": "State Street's chief investment strategist, Michael Arone, believes the US economy will avoid a recession despite high interest rates. He cites three reasons for this: artificial intelligence, immigration, and the financial health of rich people.

Arone notes that immigrants have helped stabilize the labor market and combat inflation.

Immigrants will also have a compounding impact on the economy over time, becoming entrepreneurs and driving innovation and consumption.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Economists say that one of the best ways to reduce inflation is to increase immigration, which can be done through expanding legal channels for temporary workers and admitting more family and employment-based immigrants. If polls are correct, that should be fine with Americans. Sixteen percent of registered voters labeled \u201cinflation/cost of living\u201d the most important issue facing the country today, according to a recent Fox News poll, compared to 5% who considered \u201cimmigration/border security\u201d the country\u2019s top issue. Also, research shows that increased legal admissions can reduce illegal entry. The latest economic news shows a continued strong demand for labor. That a lack of immigrants can contribute to inflation and harm Americans by reducing their purchasing power is not a new topic for economists. \u201cThe net effect of immigration on natives\u2019 purchasing power . . . depends not only on wage but also on price effects,\u201d according to research in 2008 by economist Patricia Cortes (Boston University Questrom School of Business). Cortes used confidential microdata from the Consumer Price Index and estimated the impact of low-skilled immigration on consumer prices. \u201cI find that, at current immigration levels, a 10 percent increase in the share of low\u2010skilled immigrants in the labor force decreases the price of immigrant\u2010intensive services, such as housekeeping and gardening, by 2 percent,\u201d writes Cortes. She found wage impacts mostly fell on other immigrants. \u201cLow-skilled natives and low-skilled immigrants are far from being perfect substitutes [in production] . . . therefore, a low-skilled immigration shock should affect mostly the wages of other low-skilled immigrants and have little effect on the wages of low-skilled natives.\u201d Cortes found to the extent that there were adverse wage effects, they fell on \u201cthe wages of native Hispanics with low English proficiency than on the wages of other low-skilled native groups.\u201d The most recent economic news has renewed the spotlight on employer needs for more workers. \u201cHiring strengthened in April, showing the job market is resilient amid banking turmoil, rising interest rates and high inflation,\u201d reported the Wall Street Journal (May 5, 2023). \u201cEmployers added 253,000 jobs in April, the best gain since January, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate fell to 3.4% last month, matching the lowest reading since 1969. A historically low unemployment rate kept pressure on wages, which grew 4.4% in April from a year earlier. That was slightly higher than a 4.3% annual increase in March.\u201d The Federal Reserve Board has closely watched each jobs report in evaluating what actions to take to tame inflation. \u201cThe jobs report does little to clarify the outlook for Federal Reserve policy because officials will have one more employment report before their June 13-14 meeting and because they are paying closer attention to banking stress,\u201d according to the Wall Street Journal. (Note: The article was updated to reflect the latest jobs report from the Department of Labor.) The situation America found itself in after Trump administration policies and the Covid-19 pandemic was not an immigration \u201cshock\u201d but a significant decline in admissions. In a November 30, 2022, speech at the Brookings Institution, Jerome Powell said, \u201cIn the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers, and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.\u201d said Powell. \u201cThus, another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market.\u201d Powell named \u201cexcess retirements\u201d a factor contributing to the labor shortfall. \u201cThe second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working-age population,\u201d he said. \u201cThe combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1-1/2 million missing workers.\u201d A footnote in the speech (highlighted by Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell) dealt with Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies. \u201cDue, at least in part, to pandemic-related restrictions on entry into the United States, total immigration has slowed substantially since the start of the pandemic, lowering the labor force by about 1 million people relative to pre-pandemic trends,\u201d according to the footnote. \u201cWhile lawful, nonpermanent immigration (for example, H-1B and H-2B visa holders) has bounced back considerably since earlier in the pandemic, these categories of immigration are generally still below 2019 levels. Meanwhile, lawful permanent immigration (that is, new green card holders) is also somewhat lower than in 2019 and well below levels that prevailed earlier in the 2010s.\u201d Economists Giovanni Peri and Reem Zaiour estimated that due to the pandemic and U.S. immigration policies under the Trump administration, there were 2 million fewer working-age immigrants. \u201cInflation occurs when the demand for goods and services grows faster than supply,\u201d said Mark Regets, a labor economist and a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy. \u201cIncreasing our ability to produce by increasing the supply of labor is the least painful way to control inflation.\u201d Opponents of immigration generally argue that labor shortages are inherently good, a belief economists would attribute to a lack of understanding of economics, particularly the concept of real wages and the interests of individuals as consumers. \u201cReal income, also known as real wage, is how much money an individual or entity makes after adjusting for inflation,\u201d according to the definition provided by Investopedia. In addition to other negative impacts, such as less economic growth, an insufficient number of workers can lead to inflation. When real wages are lower, workers cannot buy as much with their earnings. A recent study explored how inflation, immigration and real wages are connected. \u201cTo achieve higher real wages while reducing inflation and encouraging employment, the U.S. must either increase labor force participation and expand training or increase the pool of workers available through the admission of foreign workers,\u201d according to professors Justin Gest (George Mason University) and R. Andrew Butters (Indiana University) in research for FWD.us. \u201cThe only other remedy is for a recession to cool demand and reduce the pressure to hire\u2014a resolution few will favor.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s well-established that immigrants fill labor shortages, promote economic growth and stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation,\u201d wrote Gest in the Wall Street Journal. \u201cOur discovery of the link between migration and inflation highlights the way that immigrants also help labor markets be more responsive to local changes in demand and supply.

He remains in Crawford County Jail on $10,000 cash bond. VENEZUELAN GANG TREN DE ARAGUA TAKE OVER TEXAS HOTEL, COUNTY OFFICIALS WORK TO SHUT DOWN BUSINESS Venezuelan migrant Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate was charged with sexual assault, battery, strangulation, suffocation, false imprisonment, child abuse and disorderly conduct by Prairie du Chien Police earlier this month.\u00a0 (Crawford County Jail) The mother later told police that Coronel Zarate had also assaulted her on September 4, according to a criminal complaint. During that incident, she told police, Coronel Zarate allegedly told her, \"I get away with it. I'm a criminal.\" Teynor said that Coronel Zarate had tattoos associating him with Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in the country's prisons and has since grown a foothold in several areas across the United States.\u00a0 Members are accused of a series of high-profile crimes across the U.S., including the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley and the shooting of two NYPD officers during an arrest in June. \"I don\u2019t care what your political affiliation is. This is not a Democrat issue. It\u2019s not an independent or Libertarian issue. This is a human-rights issue,\" Van Orden said at the Sept. 9 press conference. \"American citizens\u2019 human rights are being violated. They\u2019re being kidnapped, raped and murdered by criminal illegal aliens, and it\u2019s just got to stop.\" Van Orden told Fox News Digital that he stands behind his earlier comments despite the pushback he has since received.\u00a0 The town of Prairie du Chien, pictured, has about 5,500 residents. (Photo by Melina Mara/The Washington Post) \"They're calling us racists for putting out the fact that a man with organized crime tattoos was let into the country by the Harris border czar \u2013\u00a0he happens to be Venezuelan,\" Van Orden said. Van Orden clarified that he was not opposed to legal immigrants, or immigrants who come to the country on temporary agricultural worker visas, noting that Wisconsin's farming industries rely on migrants.\u00a0 \"If we don't have immigrant labor, our dairies, our farms will go out of business. Our dairies will close if we don't have immigrant labor. I absolutely 100% welcome immigrant labor if they want to come here and work and send remittances back,\" he said. \"But letting someone into the country with tattoos associated with known immigrant gangs is not OK. We do not welcome criminal illegal immigrants to come here.\" Prairie du Chien police confirmed that Zarate had entered the country in September 2023 at or near the El Paso, Texas point of entry. TEXAS GOV. ABBOTT DESIGNATES VENEZUELAN GANG, TREN DE ARAGUA, AS A FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATION Rep. Derrick Van Orden told Fox News Digital that his hometown community of 5,500 has been shaken by the brutal crime.

They let a guy in the country with gang tattoos, and you get a medical screening before you come over the border. They give them a medical exam, because they don't want people coming over with tuberculosis,\" Van Orden said incredulously.\u00a0 The former Navy SEAL said the attack had shaken his small community, but said it was only a matter of time until migrant crime would strike there. \"Why should a town of 5,500 people . . . be afraid of letting their kids play in their front yard?\" Van Orden said. \"It wasn't like this three years ago.\" The gang member's Prairie du Chien arrest was not his first run-in with police. In November 2023, he was detained for allegedly receiving stolen property but was subsequently released.\u00a0 \"Zarate got rolled up for property crimes in Minneapolis and Minnesota that are controlled by [Governor] Tim Walz,\" Van Orden said. \"They let him go because of the sanctuary city policies.\" SUSPECTED TREN DE ARAGUA GANG MEMBERS IN AURORA, COLORADO, RELEASED ON $1,000 BOND These images from a Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin show tattoos and identifiers for Tren De Aragua.  A warrant was issued for his arrest in Wisconsin's Dane County on Dec. 1 for strangulation/suffocation, false imprisonment, battery and disorderly conduct. In addition to federal policies, Van Orden blamed Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett, a Democrat, for the incident earlier this month.\u00a0 \"Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett bears a tremendous amount of responsibility personally, and that's just a fact,\" Van Orden told Fox News Digital. \"What [he] cannot deny is that they issued a warrant for Mr. Zarate for strangulation, false imprisonment, battery and disorderly conduct. That warrant came out of his office \u2013\u00a0if he spent more time fighting crime as opposed to complaining about a Republican on his Facebook page, he would have been detained, and a mother and daughter wouldn't have spent several days being sexually assaulted.\" Van Orden and Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany penned a letter to Barrett earlier this month demanding answers regarding the warrant for Coronel Zarate.\u00a0 \"Given that Dane County was classified as \u2018non-cooperative\u2019 with federal immigration authorities as recently as June of this year by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Reps.

This inquiry is an insult to the brave men and women of our Sheriff\u2019s Office who courageously put their lives on the line in service to their community,\" Barrett wrote in an email.\u00a0 \"To the authors of this inquiry, please aim your political theatrics in a different direction as you try to recover from the thorough, factual and strategic dismantling of your presidential candidate by VP Kamala Harris,\" Barrett said. \"To save any follow-up inquiries, we have not taken reports of people eating cats or dogs.\" Christina Coulter is a U.S. and World reporter for Fox News Digital.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File)AP A new report by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the recent surge of immigration will have positive effects on the U.S. economy even ten years into the future. CBO analyzed the estimated surge in migrants (about 8.7 million) from 2021 to 2026 and the incremental impacts it will have as it boosts economic activity through 2034. The report\u2019s findings contrast with several recent polls that show rising anti-immigrant sentiment across the country as Election Day approaches. \u201cWith fewer than 100 days left in the presidential campaign, the stakes could not be higher and the contrasts couldn\u2019t be more sharp or consequential,\u201d said Vanessa C\u00e1rdenas, the executive director of the nonprofit America\u2019s Voice. \u201cThe right wing portrayal of immigration and immigrants as a national extinction-level crisis is telling and ugly. As an organization, our \u2018candidate\u2019 is immigration reform and fighting for an America that recognizes immigrants and immigration as national strengths.\u201d The report mirrored already-existing studies that show how immigration boosts the American economy and wages. According to CBO\u2019s reasoning, migrant taxes outweigh the cost of social services and will increase federal revenue by $1.2 trillion, stimulating the economy in addition to mandatory spending and interest on debt. \u201cThis is a very good time to expand legal immigration, make it a more orderly and an employment-driven process and benefit from it,\u201d University of California, Davis researcher Giovanni Peri told Forbes. But a new poll shows that more U.S. adults want to decrease immigration. It is the first time since 2005 that the majority of respondents (55 percent) indicated that sentiment. According to a February Gallup poll, nearly 30 percent of Americans rank immigration as their top issue this election. Gallup researchers said the shift in attitude may be attributable to unauthorized border crossings reaching record-breaking numbers late last year. Though levels have dropped significantly, they still remain above pre-pandemic levels. Anti-immigrant sentiment was highest in the early to mid-1990s when California received a surge of migrants and after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Polling shows 64 percent of Americans presently view immigration negatively \u2014 down from 77 percent in 2020 but higher than 52 percent in 2001. Researchers said negative views have largely been driven by Republicans. One-quarter of registered voters said a candidate must share their views on immigration to gain their vote, with Republicans more likely to feel this way.

Immigrants participate and contribute to their communities, grow the economy, pay taxes and make our neighborhoods stronger,\u201d said Heidi Altman, the director of federal advocacy at the National Immigration Law Center. \u201cWe need policymakers to reject rhetoric around immigration that is rooted in fear; this rhetoric is not only dangerous, it leads to bad policy that causes grave harm and exacerbates existing problems.\u201d The CBO report also found that increases in immigration tend to raise state and local governments\u2019 spending \u2014 mostly on education, health care, and housing \u2014 more than their revenues, but also found that most new arrivals are under 55 years old and thus of working age. They are likely to participate in the labor force, which will increase local economic growth, according to the CBO. In total, migrants in the surge population will pay about $788 billion in income and payroll taxes through the 10-year period. The agency anticipates that the effects on revenues and mandatory spending will continue growing well beyond 2034.

The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is warning that it is \"quite common\" for illegal immigrants to arrive at the southern border with no information about them on record after authorities nabbed eight Tajikistan nationals with ties to ISIS who allegedly crossed the southern border. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner was asked by NewsNation in an interview about the bust of the eight foreign nationals. All eight Tajikistan nationals allegedly crossed the U.S. southern border illegally, and, according to a federal source familiar with the sting, no information was initially flagged with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during processing.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) The suspected terrorists were \"fully vetted\" and nothing was flagged, according to Fox News' federal source. The source said after the suspected terrorists were released into the U.S., information was flagged with national security concerns, including the individuals' ties to ISIS. Lechleiter said in the interview with NewsNation that \"sometimes there is just no information on individuals\" when they\u2019re being vetted by Border Patrol. \"It is quite common where there is just nothing, you don't have anything. There's no criminal convictions, no threat information or whatever on these individuals. Or maybe these individuals are from an area that is particularly of concern but that pops up later when you get information later on,\" he said.\u00a0 CHINESE, JORDANIAN, TURKISH ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS CAUGHT IN LARGE NUMBERS AT SOUTHERN BORDER \"And as soon as we become aware of any information, like in this case we became aware, working collaboratively with FBI, we went out and got them.\" DHS and the FBI issued a joint statement about the matter earlier this week.

Earlier this year, FBI Director Christopher Wray warned of a \"wide array of very dangerous threats that emanate from the border.\" \"I want to be a little bit careful about how far I can go in an open session,\" Wray told Senate lawmakers in March. \"But there is a particular network where some of the overseas facilitators of the smuggling network have ISIS ties that we\u2019re very concerned about and that we\u2019ve been spending an enormous amount of effort with our partners to investigate. Exactly what that network is up to is something that is, again, the subject of our current investigation.\" Former ICE chief of staff Jon Feere told Fox News Digital it is difficult to vet people coming into the U.S., even if they enter legally on a visa, and particularly if they enter illegally.

But when we're dealing with mass illegal immigration, as we're experiencing now, the odds of a bad actor coming through increase, and the threats that this administration has created will be felt for years to come.\" Feere, now at the Center for Immigration Studies, also faulted other agencies for admitting people into the U.S. and then expecting ICE to deal with the outcome. \"There's this expectation that, 'Well, we'll just let them in and hope that ICE cleans up any problems.' And then when something bad does happen and ICE doesn't locate them in time, it seems the finger-pointing is all too often at ICE,\" he said.\u00a0 Fox News' Stepheny Price and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.

According to the report, New York City courtrooms are packed with people who are in the city seeking asylum but have run afoul of the law, with police sources saying that lax bail guidelines mean migrants are quickly back on the streets of the city after being arrested. \"I would say about 75% of the arrests in Midtown Manhattan are migrants, mostly for robberies, assaults, domestic incidents and selling counterfeit items,\" a Midtown Manhattan police officer told the New York Post, noting that \"you can\u2019t be 100% sure [they\u2019re migrants] unless you arrest them in a shelter or they\u2019re dumb enough to give you a shelter address.\" COLORADO MAYOR SPEAKS OUT AFTER VIDEO OF ARMED VENEZUELAN GANG IN APARTMENT GOES VIRAL: 'FAILED POLICY' Migrants reach for food being handed out while being recorded by a woman outside the Roosevelt Hotel, where dozens of recently arrived migrants have been camping out as they try to secure temporary housing on Aug. 2, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) The true scope of the problem is likely unknown, in large part because the police are not allowed to track the immigration status of people they detain. \"Police officers are prohibited from asking about the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or suspects and therefore the NYPD doesn\u2019t track data pertaining to immigration statuses.,\" an NYPD spokesperson told Fox News Digital. The problem is not just limited to Manhattan, with police sources telling the New York Post that more than 60% of arrests in Queens have also been migrants. \"There are days we have so many migrant cases, we have to call in for extra Spanish interpreters,\" a law enforcement officer at the Queens Criminal Courthouse told the New York Post.

Because this is not a normal world.\" Police say the problem in the city has been made worse by New York City sanctuary city laws, which restrict police from working with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) on cases police believe involve a migrant who is in the country illegally. \"New York City eliminated a tool to get rid of violent criminals. What a mess,\" Jim Quinn, a former prosecutor at the Queens District Attorney\u2019s Office, told the New York Post. \"The sanctuary city law is pathetic. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s crazy.\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams has called on the City Council to change the city\u2019s sanctuary laws, arguing last week that New York City\u2019s law enforcement officers \"don\u2019t have the authorization to be able to go and coordinate with ICE.

Meanwhile, some police officers in the city have become frustrated with the lack of progress, with one Queens officer arguing that New York City more resembles a \"Third World Country.\" \"Roosevelt Avenue and 91st Street looks like a scene from \u2018Casablanca\u2019 with all the vendors. You can buy food, clothes, toys, electronics, tools and get your car washed,\" the police source told the New York Post. \"The area has become a Third World country, and it seems like City Hall doesn\u2019t care about the taxpayers who live and work here.\" Get the latest updates on the ongoing border crisis from the Fox News Digital immigration hub.

        "text": "Sep 4, 2024 With illegal immigration in the news for almost four years, and a presidential election approaching, viewing this situation from an economic lens seems appropriate. According to Customs and Border Patrol Protection, encounters were 10,617,065 since Inauguration Day.  More than 10 million were admitted. This doesn\u2019t include what CBPP calls \u201cgot aways\u201d as they intentionally avoid an encounter. This number is unknown but is estimated to exceed 2 million.  The magnitudes are generally acknowledged as substantially larger than the 2016-20 period. How large is large and what difference does it make?  Consider that, according to Census Bureau data, the U.S. population was 331,449,281 at year-end 2020.  The U.S. population grew to an estimated 336,662,854 as of June 30. That represents a 1.6% increase over about four years or about 0.4% per year. This growth is smaller than historical comparisons and likely reflects an aging population and declining family size choices.  By subtraction, the population increase amounted to 5,213,730. How large is illegal immigration? It was roughly twice the natural population growth of the U.S. This influx clearly strains our infrastructure as evidenced by ubiquitous news reports.  The influx has significant demographic and economic consequences as well.  We generally know that illegal immigrants are at the lower end of the educational achievement scale and command relatively low wages.  If medical professionals, architects, engineers, schoolteachers and college faculty dominated the influx, we would have heard about it by now. This description is not intended to be derogatory, but simply to better describe the overwhelming majority of the illegal immigrants.  Eventually, most of these illegal immigrants will seek gainful employment. What impact should we expect from that assimilation?  To answer that question, we look to U.S. Census data. Poverty is roughly defined as the incomes of the lowest 20%. 20% of the current population amounts to 65,900,000 individuals. The influx of 10,000,000+ illegal aliens adds roughly 15% to the group \u2014 most competing for the same low-wage jobs.  This large increase in supply compares to the 1.6% increase in U.S. population. Since wages rarely fall, expect to see a large relative increase in unemployment among low-wage workers.  To the extent that illegal immigrants do not find gainful employment, they will add significantly to the programs designed to assist low-income wage earners.  The addition of 10 million illegal immigrants to this low wage group will increase competition for new jobs for some time into the future. As a result, wage growth of this wage group will lag what it otherwise would have been. Ironically, these expectations stand in stark contrast to the nation\u2019s goals. As citizens, we expect an opportunity to achieve The American Dream. A major part of that dream is climbing the economic ladder.  Large illegal immigration holds down wages of the group we want to assist and further increases the cost of our entitlement programs.  To add further to the irony, about 34% of those in poverty are people of color and therefore are disproportionately disadvantaged by the influx.  Enough is enough.

DAVEY/AFP via Getty Images) Refugees succeed in America by working hard, finding niches and increasing their education and ability to speak English, according to new research. The study finds refugees experience rapid earnings growth and commit far fewer criminal offenses than the U.S.-born. Refugee admissions reached historic lows under the Trump administration but have increased under Joe Biden, including the most recent presidential determination. \u201cReal earnings for refugees increased by 70% in the 10 years after arriving in the United States, showing refugees integrate and make economic progress in America,\u201d according to a new National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) analysis. \u201cThe research finds refugees have low rates of incarceration and, over time, significantly increase their education level, use less welfare and improve their ability to speak English.\u201d Mark Regets, an NFAP senior fellow and formerly an economist at the National Science Foundation, examined more than 30 years of data. He found refugees start with lower earnings but, on average, over the next 10 years, have far higher real earnings growth than other workers: 70% for refugees vs. 25% for the U.S.-born. (Real earnings are income adjusted for inflation.) He conducted the research by analyzing earnings growth and Census and immigration data on individuals aged 21 to 54 who entered America from countries with a high percentage of refugee admissions over five-year periods from 1985 through 2009. The president determines the annual ceiling for refugees, in consultation with Congress, and the U.S. Department of State administers the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Despite the divisiveness on immigration today, the U.S. Senate passed the Refugee Act of 1980 in a unanimous vote. \u201cLike other immigrants,\u201d writes Regets, \u201crefugees improve with time in the United States, particularly by investing in their skills and education, explaining why a dynamic analysis presents a more accurate picture of refugee integration than snapshots taken soon after refugees arrive.\u201d Iraqis who came to America between 2005 and 2009 had real earnings growth of 127% over the next decade, compared to 25% for U.S.-born workers. Afghans who came to the United States between 1985 and 1989 after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan saw 98% growth in real earnings over the next 10-year period, compared to 35% for U.S.-born workers. Vietnamese who arrived in America between 1985 and 1989 experienced 89% real earnings growth over the next decade. \u201cRefugees succeed in America because they add value to the U.S. economy and benefit Americans,\u201d according to Regets. \u201cDue to their rapid income growth, within a decade, refugees generally no longer have low incomes. Refugees show they adapt to the U.S. labor market and overcome the circumstances that drove them from their countries of birth. Refugees invest in U.S.-specific skills, find niches and make the U.S. economy more dynamic by 1) adapting to existing needs and 2) providing services that we didn\u2019t know were desired or needed, such as by founding or working in new restaurants, nail salons and other businesses.\u201d Refugees speak English or improve their ability to speak English and raise their educational level, according to the research. About 20% of refugees aged 21 to 54 attend school soon after arriving in America. More than 83% of refugees coming to the U.S. between 1985 and 2009 spoke English a year or more after arrival, which rose to 92% a decade later. Nearly half of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 spoke English well a year or more after arriving. That rose to 66% 10 years later, or 35% more. Refugees enter America at relatively high levels of education and improve with more time in the United States, according to the data. \u201cIn the year after arrival, 21.7% of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 had a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher compared to 26.5% for the U.S.-born. Ten years later, 28.2% of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 had a bachelor\u2019s degree, an increase of 30%.\u201d Remarkably, the number of Ethiopians who came to America between 1985 and 1989 with a bachelor\u2019s degree increased from 17% in 1990 to 45% by 2000, rising more than 150%. Seventy percent of refugees arriving in the United States between 1985 and 2009 had a high school degree or higher compared to 89% for the U.S.-born. After 10 years, 76% of refugees who arrived during this period earned a high school degree or higher, rising by 9%. Refugees appear to commit relatively few crimes. \u201cOnly 0.2% of refugees arriving in the United States between 1985 and 2009 were in jail or prison a year or more after entry vs. 1.3% for the U.S.-born,\u201d according to Regets. \u201cIncarceration rates remain low for refugees 10 years later.\u201d The more time refugees spend in the United States, the less likely they are to use welfare. On average, after 10 years, refugee use of welfare declined by 63% for those arriving between 1985 and 2009 (9.4% in the year after arrival to 3.5% a decade later. Welfare use measures \u201creceipt of any public assistance income,\u201d which includes state and federal assistance. \u201cThe rapid earnings growth of refugees,\u201d concludes Regets, \u201cand their improving levels of education and ability to speak English show they integrate into American society, fill niches and expand the economy, rewarding the American people for welcoming them to a new land.\u201d",
        "summary": "A new study by the National Foundation for American Policy finds that refugees in the US experience rapid earnings growth and commit fewer crimes than US-born citizens. Refugees' real earnings increase by 70% in the 10 years after arriving in the US, compared to 25% for US-born workers. Refugees start with lower earnings but quickly catch up and surpass US-born workers. The study analyzed 30 years of data on refugees who entered the US between 1985 and 2009. Refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Vietnam showed particularly high earnings growth, with increases ranging from 89% to 127%. Refugees also increase their education level and ability to speak English over time. About 20% of refugees attend school soon after arriving in the US, and over 83% speak English a year or more after arrival. Refugees are less likely to use welfare over time, with a 63% decline in welfare use after 10 years.

Overall, the study suggests that refugees integrate into American society, fill niches, and expand the economy."

Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images A new study estimates that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, while often being shut out of the programs their taxes fund. In 40 states, undocumented immigrants paid higher tax rates than the top 1% of the income scale in those states, according to a study released Tuesday by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning, nonprofit think tank. The study, which uses estimates of undocumented immigrants\u2019 tax contributions as of 2022, shows those totaled $96.7 billion that year. In Maryland, they paid an estimated $779.3 million in total taxes that year, the ninth most among states, according to the report. Study authors also found that undocumented immigrants would contribute $40.2 billion more per year in federal, state and local taxes \u2013 an additional $262 million in Maryland \u2013 if all of the undocumented population had access to work authorization. The report\u2019s authors reasoned that this boost would come from higher wages associated with employment authorization and easier compliance with income tax laws. The report also shed further light on the tax revenue provided by undocumented immigrants on the state and local level. Undocumented immigrants are paying 46% of their state and local tax payments through sales and excise taxes. Six states \u2014 New Jersey, New York, California, Florida, Texas, and Illinois \u2014 were able to raise more than $1 billion each in tax revenue from undocumented immigrants, the nonprofit said. Undocumented immigrants pay property taxes and sales taxes, and federal payroll taxes taken from their wages, as well as income tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification numbers. Those payroll taxes fund Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance, social programs that undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in and receive regular benefits from. The bridge collapse is an immigration story  Immigrants can also face barriers to getting tax refunds, including getting scammed by unscrupulous tax preparers who target immigrant communities, said Jackie Vimo, senior analyst of economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, in a media call on the report. The center focuses on racial, economic and social justice for low-income immigrants. \u201cThere are tons of laws that prevent undocumented workers from getting benefits,\u201d said Richard C. Auxier, a principal policy associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that was not involved in the study. \u201cThey get a lot of political attention. At the end of the day, they\u2019re just normal people paying normal taxes.\u201d Alexis Tsoukalas, senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute, a nonprofit focused on economic mobility for Floridians, told reporters on Monday that she was struck by how much the state collected in taxes from undocumented immigrants compared to the wealthiest in the state. The current tax rate for undocumented immigrants in Florida is 8% compared to the top 1% of the state at 2.7%. \u201cThis means hundreds of thousands of everyday people are contributing more than their share to public services they cannot even access, meanwhile those with the most to give and the most to benefit contribute the least,\u201d Tsoukalas said. The findings appear to counter anti-immigrant rhetoric that undocumented immigrants are \u201cdestroying\u201d social programs. The study comes at a time when states are passing laws to arrest people they suspect of entering the U.S. illegally, a power long reserved for the federal government, and the Biden administration has taken executive action to allow for the deportation of many asylum seekers without processing their claims. The Republican Party platform this year promises the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d if former President Donald Trump is reelected, and tax policy will also be front and center for Congress and the White House next year as provisions of Trump\u2019s tax law, passed in 2017, are set to expire. Aside from the human cost of deportations on families, policy experts and researchers are making the case that there is an economic cost as well, arguing that undocumented immigrants are a boon to the economy. Immigration and economic experts who spoke about the significance of the report on Monday highlighted the Congressional Budget Office\u2019s July report on the rise in immigration and its effects on the economy and budget, which found that this increase in immigration would add $1.2 trillion in federal revenue from 2024 to 2034. Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there are economic ripple effects to consider in the deportation of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. beyond taxes. \u201cIf you deported someone and they\u2019re no longer making taxable purchases in their community, that number would reflect a reduction in their sales tax payments to the community but it wouldn\u2019t capture that second ripple effect of the business has less profits because they have fewer customers,\u201d Davis said in a media call on the study. Auxier said that researchers have found that while children in an undocumented immigrant household receive education benefits that could be larger than the tax payments of their lower-income working parents, that is more of an income issue than a specific immigration issue. The other side of that coin, Auxier notes, is that in the future, undocumented households may in fact give back more than they received. \u201cThose same studies tend to note that if the children go to school and they then go get jobs, now the American household is giving more than it got because the parents came here, worked, paid into Social Security, Medicare and didn\u2019t get any benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kid went to school and then they got a job and then they started earning enough money that they were a net contributor.\u201d Policy experts also pointed to a labor shortage \u2014 8.1 million job openings and 6.8 million unemployed workers in June, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \u2014 as a reason to embrace the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants. Maryland, South Dakota, North Dakota, Vermont, Maine, and South Carolina are some of the states facing the greatest labor shortages, according to a Washington Post analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. \u201cImmigrants are already filling that [labor] gap and if we have mass deportations where millions of immigrants are torn from their family members and the country they have made home, we will not only have the human impact of this, but we\u2019ll have a severe effect on the economy and available workforce,\u201d said Vimo of the National Immigration Law Center. by Casey Quinlan, Maryland Matters August 2, 2024 by Casey Quinlan, Maryland Matters August 2, 2024 A new study estimates that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, while often being shut out of the programs their taxes fund. In 40 states, undocumented immigrants paid higher tax rates than the top 1% of the income scale in those states, according to a study released Tuesday by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning, nonprofit think tank. The study, which uses estimates of undocumented immigrants\u2019 tax contributions as of 2022, shows those totaled $96.7 billion that year. In Maryland, they paid an estimated $779.3 million in total taxes that year, the ninth most among states, according to the report. Study authors also found that undocumented immigrants would contribute $40.2 billion more per year in federal, state and local taxes \u2013 an additional $262 million in Maryland \u2013 if all of the undocumented population had access to work authorization. The report\u2019s authors reasoned that this boost would come from higher wages associated with employment authorization and easier compliance with income tax laws. The report also shed further light on the tax revenue provided by undocumented immigrants on the state and local level. Undocumented immigrants are paying 46% of their state and local tax payments through sales and excise taxes. Six states \u2014 New Jersey, New York, California, Florida, Texas, and Illinois \u2014 were able to raise more than $1 billion each in tax revenue from undocumented immigrants, the nonprofit said. Undocumented immigrants pay property taxes and sales taxes, and federal payroll taxes taken from their wages, as well as income tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification numbers. Those payroll taxes fund Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance, social programs that undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in and receive regular benefits from. The bridge collapse is an immigration story  Immigrants can also face barriers to getting tax refunds, including getting scammed by unscrupulous tax preparers who target immigrant communities, said Jackie Vimo, senior analyst of economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, in a media call on the report. The center focuses on racial, economic and social justice for low-income immigrants. \u201cThere are tons of laws that prevent undocumented workers from getting benefits,\u201d said Richard C. Auxier, a principal policy associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that was not involved in the study. \u201cThey get a lot of political attention. At the end of the day, they\u2019re just normal people paying normal taxes.\u201d Alexis Tsoukalas, senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute, a nonprofit focused on economic mobility for Floridians, told reporters on Monday that she was struck by how much the state collected in taxes from undocumented immigrants compared to the wealthiest in the state. The current tax rate for undocumented immigrants in Florida is 8% compared to the top 1% of the state at 2.7%. \u201cThis means hundreds of thousands of everyday people are contributing more than their share to public services they cannot even access, meanwhile those with the most to give and the most to benefit contribute the least,\u201d Tsoukalas said. The findings appear to counter anti-immigrant rhetoric that undocumented immigrants are \u201cdestroying\u201d social programs. The study comes at a time when states are passing laws to arrest people they suspect of entering the U.S. illegally, a power long reserved for the federal government, and the Biden administration has taken executive action to allow for the deportation of many asylum seekers without processing their claims. The Republican Party platform this year promises the \u201clargest deportation operation in American history\u201d if former President Donald Trump is reelected, and tax policy will also be front and center for Congress and the White House next year as provisions of Trump\u2019s tax law, passed in 2017, are set to expire.

        "text": "In an era of globalisation, few topics have sparked as much debate as immigration. Since the 2016 Brexit referendum, the United Kingdom has grappled with this issue, often framing it as a problem to be solved rather than an opportunity to be embraced. This article aims to shed light on the economic realities of immigration, dispelling common myths and highlighting the substantial benefits that immigrants bring to the UK economy, while also addressing the complex human aspects of this multifaceted issue. This is a worthwhile read, I promise you.Understanding the Human Face of ImmigrationBefore delving into the economic impacts, it's crucial to understand the human dimension of immigration.A. Push vs. Pull Factors in ImmigrationImmigration is often driven by a complex interplay of factors that either \"push\" people from their home countries or \"pull\" them towards new destinations.1. Push Factors: - War and conflict- Political persecution- Economic instability- Climate change and natural disasters- Lack of opportunities2. Pull Factors: - Economic opportunities- Political stability- Better education and healthcare systems- Family reunification- Freedom and human rights protectionsB. Current Conflicts Driving ImmigrationSeveral ongoing conflicts and crises are currently driving significant migration flows:1. Syrian Civil War2. Afghanistan: Taliban takeover in 20213. Ukraine-Russia Conflict: Russian invasion of Ukraine in 20224. Climate-induced DisplacementC. The Human PerspectiveBehind every statistic is a human story. Many immigrants, particularly refugees and asylum seekers, have faced unimaginable hardships. Consider: If you were faced with the choice between staying in a war-torn country where your family's safety was at risk, or embarking on a dangerous journey for the chance of a safer life, what would you do?II. Economic Contributions of ImmigrantsA. Impact on GDPImmigrants have consistently made positive contributions to the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to a report by Oxford Economics, European immigrants alone contributed \u00a32,300 more to UK public finances each year than the average adult resident.B. Labour Market ContributionsImmigrants play a crucial role in filling labour shortages across various sectors of the UK economy, often taking on jobs that are essential but less attractive to native-born workers.C. Entrepreneurship and InnovationImmigrants are not just employees; many are job creators and innovators. A study by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor found that immigrants in the UK are more likely to start businesses than native-born citizens.III. Sector-Specific BenefitsA. Industries Most Positively Impacted1. Healthcare: As of 2023, approximately 170,000 NHS staff in England reported a non-British nationality, making up about 14% of the workforce.2. Technology: According to Tech Nation, around 42% of UK tech startups have at least one foreign-born founder.3. Agriculture: Seasonal agricultural workers, many of whom are immigrants, are crucial for the UK's food security.B. Potential Growth Areas1. Green Energy: Immigrants with specialised skills in renewable energy technologies could play a pivotal role in the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy.2. Research and Development: Attracting top global talent could further boost the UK's position as a leader in scientific research and innovation.IV. Debunking Common MythsA. Job Displacement ConcernsContrary to popular belief, immigrants do not typically \"steal\" jobs from native workers. A study by the Migration Advisory Committee found that immigration has little impact on average wages of UK-born workers.B. Strain on Public ServicesWhile there is a common perception that immigrants overburden public services, research shows that they are net contributors to the UK economy. A report by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that higher net migration reduces pressure on government debt over time.C. Crime RatesData from the UK Home Office consistently shows that immigrants are no more likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. In fact, areas with high immigration often see decreases in crime rates.V. Case StudiesA. Successful Immigrant Entrepreneurs1. Elon Musk: Born in South Africa, lived as an undocumented immigrant in Canada before moving to the US. Now holds citizenship in South Africa, Canada, and the US.2. Dame Manju Shahul-Hameed: The first Asian woman to become Mayor of Croydon, a successful businesswoman who has made significant contributions to both the business world and public service in the UK.B. Immigrant Contributions in Key SectorsDr. Maggie Aderin-Pocock: A British-Nigerian space scientist and science educator who has made significant contributions to UK space exploration and science communication.VI. Global PerspectiveA. Comparison with US and European DataThe positive impact of immigration on economic growth is not unique to the UK. In the United States and Germany, studies have found immigrants to be net contributors to public finances.B. Economic Outcomes in Countries with Pro-Immigration PoliciesCanada, known for its points-based immigration system, has seen consistent economic growth partly attributed to its welcoming stance on immigration.VII. The Path to CitizenshipA. Current Pathways in the UKThe UK offers several routes to citizenship, including naturalisation after residing in the country for a specified period, marriage to a British citizen, and the EU Settlement Scheme for EU citizens who were residing in the UK before Brexit.B. Economic Benefits of NaturalizationResearch suggests that naturalised citizens often see improvements in their economic situations, with higher employment rates and earnings compared to non-naturalized immigrants.VIII. The Role of Media and Public PerceptionA. Impact of Conservative Media NarrativesConservative media outlets have often portrayed immigration in a negative light, potentially influencing public opinion and policy. This has contributed to a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment over the past decade.B. Addressing the Rise of Anti-Immigrant SentimentIt's crucial to counter these narratives with factual information about the economic benefits of immigration and the human stories behind the statistics.IX. Housing and Support for Asylum SeekersA. Government Support for Asylum Seekers1. Scale and Cost: - As of March 2020, approximately 48,000 asylum seekers were under new accommodation contracts in the UK.- The cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels was estimated at \u00a35.6 million per day in February 2023, according to Home Office figures.2. Types of Accommodation:- Contrary to some claims, most asylum seekers are not housed in luxury hotels.- While hotels are sometimes used as initial accommodation, hostel-type facilities are more common.- The government is exploring alternatives like the Bibby Stockholm barge to reduce costs.B. Debunking Common Myths1. \"48,000 illegal immigrants in luxury hotels\": This claim is false. According to Reuters fact-checking, only about 1,000 asylum seekers were housed in hotels each night as of March 2020.2. Comparison with Veteran Homelessness: Claims about large numbers of homeless veterans compared to housed asylum seekers are often unsubstantiated.C. Economic and Ethical ConsiderationsWhile the costs of supporting asylum seekers are substantial, they should be viewed in the context of the UK's overall budget and its humanitarian commitments.X. Voices of SupportA. Quotes from Prominent Investors and Business LeadersWarren Buffett: \"Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.\"Sir Richard Branson: \"For Britain to be successful, it must take a leading role in this competitive world \u2013 and for that we need an open economy that gives all, including migrants, an opportunity to contribute.\"B. Economic Expert OpinionsProfessor Jonathan Portes, King's College London: \"The economic impacts of immigration to the UK have been mostly positive, and there is no reason to fear moderate increases in immigration in the future.\"The evidence is clear: immigration has been and continues to be a net positive for the UK economy. From filling crucial labour shortages to driving innovation and entrepreneurship, immigrants contribute significantly to economic growth and diversity. While concerns about immigration are understandable, they are often based on misconceptions rather than economic realities.As the UK navigates its post-Brexit future, it's crucial to embrace evidence-based policy-making regarding immigration. By welcoming diverse talent and fostering an inclusive environment, the UK can enhance its economic resilience and maintain its position as a global leader in innovation and growth.The path forward should involve a balanced approach that recognizes the economic benefits of immigration while addressing legitimate concerns through thoughtful policy. By doing so, the UK can harness the full potential of immigration to drive prosperity for all its residents, both native-born and immigrant alike, while fulfilling its humanitarian obligations on the global stage.Want to know more?https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/References:1.

Logan Our people Transparency Speeches Connect with us July 02, 2024 The current U.S. immigration surge is unprecedented. The influx flew under the radar for some time, dismissed simply as pent-up immigration from when the borders essentially closed during the pandemic. But this year\u2019s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) budget and economic outlook brought new attention to the migrant inflow and its expected economic effects. By incorporating previously unavailable data on migration along the southwest border into the government\u2019s economic and fiscal outlook, the macroeconomic implications of such high levels of migration come into focus. The labor force in 2033  will be larger by 5.2 million people, mostly because of higher net immigration, according to CBO estimates. As a result of the immigration surge, GDP will be higher by about $8.9  trillion and federal government tax revenues by $1.2 trillion over the 2024-34  period. Deficits will be lower by $900 billion. Government estimates of net immigration differ wildly. Census 2023 estimates (July to July) put net immigration at 1.1 million, far from CBO\u2019s calendar-year 2023 estimate of 3.3 million (Chart 1). CBO similarly estimated a much higher net immigration number than other agencies in 2022\u20142.7 million. Net immigration is the sum of individuals who enter the country minus those who leave. Entries can be permanent or temporary but exclude short-term visitors such as tourists. Entries can also be legal, when people come with U.S. government visas, or otherwise, such as humanitarian migrants (asylum seekers and, more recently, humanitarian parolees) and unauthorized immigrants.  CBO included real-time data on the number of border crossers allowed into the country, statistics that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently made available. Recently released 2023 data on immigrant work permits cast doubt on the lower immigration estimates in Chart 1 and are broadly supportive of CBO\u2019s higher numbers. In 2023 alone, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel encountered 2.54 million migrants at the southwest border (Chart 2). This is about the same as the 2.58 million migrants in 2022, a record year. This compares with the prepandemic annual average of 500,000 migrants. Since the pandemic began in the U.S. in February 2020, CBP has recorded almost 8 million encounters at the southwest border, along with almost 2 million encounters at the northern border, coastal border and airports. \u201cEncounters,\u201d previously known as apprehensions, include all people at and between ports of entry who are either stopped by the Border Patrol or who turn themselves in. In recent years, an increasing share of migrants simply approaches the Border Patrol and states an intention to seek asylum. During the pandemic and until May 2023, some of these migrants, typically single adults, were immediately expelled under a provision known as Title 42, used to deny migrants entrance because of public health concerns related to COVID. However, more consideration was given to families and unaccompanied minors, and so even before the end of Title 42, the volume of migrants far exceeded available detention space. As a result, the majority of migrants has been paroled or otherwise released into the country to pursue asylum claims or other immigration pathways. Notably, Border Patrol encounters do not include got-aways, or unauthorized immigrants, who escape the notice of Border Patrol while crossing or who are seen but not stopped. DHS publishes estimates of such migrants, although the figures differ significantly from estimates by demographers, at least in recent years. Though the number of encounters does not necessarily translate directly to the number of migrants admitted into the U.S., a smaller share is getting turned away than previously. In 2023, fewer than a quarter of encounters at the southwest U.S. border ended in migrants being refused entry into the U.S., and 58 percent of encounters resulted in migrants released or paroled into the interior (Chart 3). This is a reversal from the previous nine years, when more than half of the 8.7 million migrants apprehended at the southern border were not admitted to the U.S., and less than a quarter were allowed in. Harsh and deteriorating conditions in many Latin American and Caribbean nations, including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, prompted the U.S. government to expand programs such as humanitarian parole for those nations\u2019 natives. Many migrants risk the trip to not only escape difficult circumstances, but also on the belief they can enter the United States under humanitarian provisions. Another pull factor is the availability of work and rising wages. The postpandemic U.S. labor market was extremely tight, especially in sectors that tend to rely on immigrant labor. The job openings rate, or the number of job vacancies as a share of total employment in a sector, reached record highs in 2021 and 2022 for accommodation and food services, retail trade and health care and social assistance, among others. Wages also rose faster in immigrant-intensive occupations and industries than in those that had a lower share of immigrants (Chart 4). Studies have shown that U.S. labor market conditions are among the main drivers of unauthorized immigration. With this recent immigration wave, the foreign-born labor force has recovered completely from the pandemic drop, even exceeding what would have been expected absent the pandemic (Chart 5). The foreign-born labor force reached February 2020 levels in November 2021, and surpassed trend growth in August 2022, according to the Current Population Survey. If the foreign-born labor force had grown at the 2000\u201319 trend rate of 2.2 percent per year starting in January 2020, it would have been smaller by almost 900,000 people in April 2024. The jump in ready-to-work immigrants has boosted population, labor force and job growth in the postpandemic U.S. economy. Estimates from the Hamilton Project suggest higher immigration boosted payroll job growth by 70,000 jobs per month in 2022 and by 100,000 jobs per month in 2023 and so far in 2024. The upper end of the range of job growth has doubled to 200,000 from 100,000 jobs per month absent the surge of immigration. It\u2019s not unusual for immigration to account for high shares of job growth. Before the pandemic, from 2010 to 2019, the share of job growth attributable to immigration averaged 45 percent. The jump in jobs, along with immigrants\u2019 consumption of goods and services in the United States, also bolsters GDP growth. According to the Hamilton Project study, higher immigration has contributed about 0.1 percentage points to GDP growth annually in 2022 and 2023 and is projected to do so again in 2024. The effect on inflation, meanwhile, could be neutral on average. Higher immigration represents a labor supply shock, which should be disinflationary. But immigrants are also consumers and add to aggregate demand. While certain sectors that extensively depend on immigrants should see costs and prices fall\u2014for example, landscaping and child care\u2014the population influx could put upward pressure on rents and house prices, particularly in the short run before new supply can be built. The immigration surge has surprised many, and not everyone agrees with the CBO numbers. But household survey data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) are consistent with CBO estimates of immigration in 2023. According to the CPS, the foreign-born population rose by 2.5 million from December 2022 to December 2023, even as we estimate about 500,000 immigrants died. These data points are consistent with a net immigrant inflow of at least 3 million over the year. The doubts about CBO\u2019s large number involve problems with encounter data (it measures events, not individuals), debates about migrant return rates and criticism of the household survey (whether it overcounts or undercounts immigrants). CBO\u2019s immigration projections are even more uncertain, with expected net immigration of 3.3 million in 2024, 2.6 million in 2025, 1.6 million in 2026 and a return to the historical average 1.1 million in 2027\u201333. It\u2019s unclear what factors drive these transitions. Potential changes in U.S. immigration policy, such as the Biden administration\u2019s recent executive action limiting the entry of some migrants, or an economic downturn could result in gradual normalization of immigration at the border. Even so, many of the migrants who arrived in recent years will want to stay in the United States. Asylum approval rates have risen since 2020 but reflect cases filed in years prior. It\u2019s impossible to know what approval rates will be for those who filed their claims more recently. Humanitarian parolees, in contrast, are supposed to return to their home countries after two years. If immigration normalizes, it will return to rates that are insufficient to sustain the type of economic growth the U.S. is accustomed to. The nation is in a sort of demographic autumn, and winter is coming. The retirement of the baby boomers and overall aging of the workforce, as well as low and falling birth rates mean population growth will become entirely dependent on immigration by 2040, as deaths of U.S.-born will outpace births (Chart 6). Because economic growth depends on labor, capital and productivity, growth in these factors will set the speed limit of the economy. While technological advances and incentives for investment will contribute to productivity growth, immigration will be vital to propping up labor force growth. About the authors \nPia M.

        "summary": "The current US immigration surge is unprecedented and has flown under the radar until recently. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has brought attention to the migrant inflow and its expected economic effects. The CBO estimates that the labor force will be larger by 5.2 million people in 2033 due to higher net immigration. As a result, GDP will be higher by about $8.9 trillion and federal government tax revenues by $1.2 trillion over the 2024-34 period. Deficits will be lower by $900 billion. Government estimates of net immigration differ wildly, with the CBO estimating 3.3 million in 2023 and the Census Bureau estimating 1.1 million. The CBO includes real-time data on border crossers, which casts doubt on lower immigration estimates. The labor market has been extremely tight, especially in sectors that rely on immigrant labor, which has driven the immigration surge. Higher immigration has boosted population, labor force, and job growth in the post-pandemic US economy. The effect of immigration on inflation is expected to be neutral on average, but could put upward pressure on rents and house prices in the short run."

Washington\u2019s decision to move some 750 agents from commercial to immigration duties to handle a surge in families seeking asylum in the United States has triggered the delays at crucial ports on a border that handle US$ 1.7 billion in daily trade.  \u201cThe situation in Ciudad Juarez is very serious because these auto parts go to plants in the United States and obviously they put at risk the operation in the United States,\u201d Eduardo Solis, the president of the Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA), said on Monday. The North American auto industry is highly integrated and many car parts cross the border several times before they are finally installed on a vehicle.\u00a0 Seventeen 17 hours before the crossing to El Paso even opened on Monday morning, trucks were already lining up in Ciudad Juarez to avoid the fate of some 7,500 trailers that failed to cross last week, said Manuel Sotelo, vice president at the Mexican National Chamber of Freight Transport\u2019s north division.  That is roughly half the number of trucks per week that usually cross there, carrying everything from car and plane parts to refrigerators, washing machines, TVs, cell phones and computers.  \u201cThis is not normal. We had never seen this before in Ciudad Juarez,\u201d said Sotelo.  Despite elevated costs, some Mexican exporters are turning to air freight to avoid the mile-long lines at the border.  \u201cWe\u2019re using charter (planes) which cost between US$ 35,000 and US$ 100,000 depending on the volume and merchandise,\u201d said Pedro Chavira, who heads the manufacturing industry chamber INDEX in Ciudad Juarez.

        "text": "Immigration isn't taking jobs away from Americans \u2014 and it's actually great for the US economy, according to Nobel laureate Paul Krugman. In an op-ed for The New York Times, the top economist pointed to economic arguments against immigration, with former President Trump claiming that immigrants have been taking job gains away from native-born Americans in recent years. However, Krugman said the data don't support that argument, as the unemployment rate for US-born workers has remained near a historical low of 4.3%, according to Federal Reserve data. The labor force participation rate among native-born workers has been on the decline, but among prime-age native-born workers, the labor force participation rate has actually been rising, Fed data shows. That's a solid sign that the stagnation among US workers is largely because of the wave of boomers retiring, Krugman said. \"So the near stagnation of native-born employment isn't a demand-side issue, in which people aren't working because they can't find jobs. It is instead a supply-side issue, in which people aren't working because they've reached retirement age. We've been able to achieve large increases in overall employment only because working-age immigrants have been coming to America. If we didn't have the immigrants, we wouldn't have the jobs,\" Krugman wrote. There's also evidence that immigration has helped push wages up, as immigrants do not ultimately compete with US workers for the same jobs. Wages among all workers have shot up 25% since 2020, around the time the employment of foreign-born workers in the US began rising. Immigration could also be helping the Fed keep a lid on inflation, Krugman said. \"Immigrants expand supply, but they also contribute to demand. In the aftermath of the pandemic, however, the huge sums spent on aid pumped up demand; this burst of demand was easier to accommodate without sustained inflation because immigration made it possible to achieve rapid growth in employment,\" he added. Other economists and strategists on Wall Street have said immigration could end up being a big boost to the economy. Rising immigration could help the US grow another $7 trillion over the next 10 years, according to a recent projection from the Congressional Budget Office. \"So, no, immigrants aren't taking our jobs. Everything that happens in the economy hurts someone: There are no doubt some places where immigrants have driven up housing costs, or where native-born Americans or legal immigrants have faced increased job competition. But the scare stories don't match the facts,\" Krugman said. Jump to",

Doing so \u2013 as all of our neighboring states have already done \u2013 or permitting the City of Philadelphia to do so at the local level will help to alleviate poverty in Pennsylvania and ensure that every worker receives a fair, family-sustaining wage. Nobody reading these words needs to be reminded that Philadelphia, with a poverty rate that remains above 20%, has consistently been called \u201cthe poorest big city in America\u201d \u2013 a label that has stuck despite steady economic improvements over the last decade. As countless reports have shown, our city\u2019s economic gains over the past 15 years have not been evenly shared across all neighborhoods and communities, leading to what many call \u201ca tale of two cities.\u201d Recently published data reveals that while roughly 1 in 8 white households in Philadelphia experience poverty, 1 in 4 African American households are living below the poverty line. Meanwhile, 33% of Hispanic households in Philadelphia have incomes below the poverty level \u2013 the highest of any ethnic group. While white, Asian and Hispanic households have seen median household income rise by more than 20% since 2010, African American families\u2019 median income increased by just 5.7% over the same period.

As PA sees record number of SNAP recipients, advocates call for a minimum wage increase How raising the minimum wage would help some and hurt others Even a cursory review of the math shows that Pennsylvania\u2019s minimum wage is wholly inadequate for supporting the needs of working Pennsylvanians and their families. According to the Living Wage Calculator, a tool created by MIT professor Amy K. Glassmeier to calculate the wage necessary in different states to pay for basic necessities, the breadwinner in a two-parent, two-child household must earn more than five times the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to make ends meet. In higher-cost localities like Philadelphia, a minimum-wage paycheck would be stretched even further. In fact, Philadelphia was found to have the fourth-lowest \u201creal minimum wage\u201d of all American cities, according to a recent SmartAsset study, meaning that our city is among the most difficult places in the country for minimum-wage workers to afford basic necessities. Nobody working a full-time job should have to struggle to make ends meet and raising Pennsylvania\u2019s outdated minimum wage is a matter of basic fairness for working families in our commonwealth.\u00a0 Increasing the wage to at least $15 per hour \u2013 a figure already reached in New York and New Jersey, and which will be reached in Maryland and Delaware by 2025 \u2013 and tying automatic increases to the rate of inflation will help ensure that hard-working Pennsylvanians can earn enough to support themselves and their families. While many opponents will point to anticipated job losses and business closures in the event that employers are required to raise wages, other cities\u2019 and states\u2019 experiences after increasing the minimum wage have shown that these fears are not founded in the data. Gov. Josh Shapiro has again proposed a minimum wage increase as a part of his budget address to the General Assembly and it is incumbent upon our elected leaders in Harrisburg to take up this proposal and ensure that every Pennsylvanian, regardless of their ZIP code or background, has access to family-sustaining employment and meaningful economic opportunity. Now is the time for our leaders in Harrisburg to take steps to improve the lives of working families in Philadelphia and across our commonwealth.\n\n Philadelphia City Council President Kenyatta Johnson, a former state representative, serves Philadelphia\u2019s Second Council District, which includes parts of Center City, South Philadelphia, and Southwest Philadelphia. \nNEXT STORY:\n\n              Opinion: Time for a full stop on marijuana arrests in Pennsylvania\n            \n\n\n\n News & Politics Policy Personality Power Lists Opinion First Read Magazine Resource Directory Events About Follow Us Help us tailor content specifically for you:",

The Examiner revealed details of a leaked report which showed that plans to increase the minimum wage to \u00a313.73 in April 2025 could cost private and third sector businesses up to \u00a3188m in the first year alone. Now the island\u2019s Chamber of Commerce has responded to the findings of the report that was commissioned by the minimum wage committee. It noted that the report highlighted some potential benefits, but also reflected business community concerns about potential negative impacts. While businesses support moves to help lower paid employees, said Chamber, the proposed increase will have an impact that is not in the island\u2019s long-term economic interests and could lead to more redundancies and business closures. It pointed out many employers are already under extreme financial pressure and need more time to phase in the changes. The chamber is urging government to reconsider the April 2025 deadline and look at what support could be provided to help businesses offset some of increased costs.\u00a0 Its chief executive officer Rebecca George said: \u2018Chamber appreciates the good motives behind Tynwald and government\u2019s commitment to transition to the minimum wage by April 2025, but there are still widespread concerns in the business community. \u2018Chamber, acting on behalf of the business community, has major concerns regarding the proposed timeline and its potential economic ramifications. \u2018Increasing the minimum wage hourly rate to \u00a313.73 in April 2025 would represent an increase of 28% when compared to the 2023 rate of \u00a310.75. \u2018The proposed increase is approximately 14 times greater than the current inflation rate which is around 2%. \u2018The living wage increases are also above the inflation rate, and the combined effects of these disparities will make Isle of Man businesses less competitive. \u2018But businesses are also concerned about the speed at which the new minimum wage rate is being introduced and the difficulties it creates in terms of employers maintaining financial sustainability.\u2019 The report, which was conducted by Pragmatix Advisory, found that the impact of any wage increase for lower paid workers would be diluted by increases in tax and National Insurance. It\u2019s important to note, said Chamber, that while the island\u2019s minimum wage has risen by around 38% since 2018, personal allowances have risen by only 9% over the same period.\u00a0 Increasing the minimum wage by 28% could have several significant impacts especially on the retail, hospitality and care sectors, the report finds. The Chamber said there are many concerns within the business community, with the three most important being economic disruption and job losses, inflationary pressures and price increases and the need for gradual implementation. Overall, said Chamber, while higher minimum wages can improve living standards for workers, the impacts on a number of sectors in the Manx economy are likely to vary depending upon individual business models, market conditions, and consumer responses. In a joint statement, the Department for Enterprise and Treasury said they had to balance the needs of employers and employees and take into account the broader economic context. They said it was up to the minimum wage committee to review the report's findings, along with other inputs from their consultation process, to make a \u2018well-rounded\u2019 recommendation - to enable the departments to lay a proposal before Tynwald in October. \u2018Given the report\u2019s limitations due to its sample size, it is expected to be considered as one element in a broader assessment,\u2019 they added. \u2018Ultimately any adjustments to the island\u2019s minimum wage rates will be subject to Tynwald consideration and approval.'

This story is part of California Voices, a commentary forum aiming to broaden our understanding of the state and spotlight Californians directly impacted by policy or its absence. Learn more here. Every session of the California Legislature seems to produce at least one bill that generates high-octane political debate and media attention. As the 2023-24 session winds down this week, Senate Bill 1047, which would impose rules on artificial intelligence developers, is generating fierce lobbying and drawing global interest. During the final days of last year\u2019s session, the focus was on a very different issue \u2014 whether the state should impose a $20-per-hour minimum wage for fast food workers and create a Fast Food Council to oversee working conditions. A year before, Assembly Bill 257 created the council and empowered it to set an initial minimum wage of at least $22 an hour, while assuming that franchised fast food outlets were subsidiaries of the parent company, rather than independently owned. The fast food industry responded with a referendum that, if ratified by voters, would cancel out the new law, thus renewing the debate in the 2023 session. A last-minute deal repealed AB 257 and substituted another measure, AB 1228, that dictated a $20 minimum wage and removed what the industry considered to be a threat to the franchise system. In return, the referendum was dropped. The $20 wage took effect last April, but only after a new squabble erupted over which sellers of food would be covered, colored by a Bloomberg article alleging that Newsom had demanded an exemption to benefit a campaign donor who owns two dozen Panera locations in California. Newsom declared that the story was \u201cabsurd\u201d and gave assurances that Panera and other similar businesses would be covered. The businessman, billionaire Greg Flynn, also said he would honor the $20 wage. End of fast food angst? Of course not. Six months after the $20 wage took effect there\u2019s a new debate in political, media and academic circles over its impact. Fast food prices have been increasing, but how much higher wages are driving the rise and how fast food operations have changed are two new issues. This month, Newsom declared that California fast food outlets had created 11,000 new jobs since the law was signed. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for workers is good for business, and as California\u2019s fast food industry continues booming every single month our workers are finally getting the pay they deserve,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cDespite those who pedaled lies about how this would doom the industry, California\u2019s economy and workers are again proving them wrong.\u201d The industry didn\u2019t agree. \u00a0\u201cEvery day you see headlines of restaurant closures, employee job losses and hours cut, and rising food prices for consumers,\u201d the International Franchise Association said in a statement. \u201cLocal restaurant owners in California are already struggling to cope with the $20/hour wage, as the Fast Food Council considers additional wage increases. All the while, workers and consumers are feeling the pinch.\u201d Brooke Armour, president of the California Center for Jobs and the Economy, an adjunct of the Business Roundtable, criticized Newsom\u2019s declaration as reflecting just one month of preliminary data and concluding, \u201cDespite what some are saying, the data are clear: newly passed fast food minimum wage laws are leading to job losses in California.\u201d Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, also was critical in an analysis of the state\u2019s economic trends. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s well-intended push to reduce income inequality via wage floors is beginning to have a significant negative impact on some of our most vulnerable workers \u2014 our youth, particularly those from lower income households,\u201d Thornberg wrote. What California has wrought in the fast food industry could be the harbinger of more direct regulation of other industries, and not just in California, for better or worse. It\u2019s not surprising, therefore, that its effects will be debated ad nauseam. Read more from CalMatters Text Get breaking news on your phone.

The fast food industry responded with a referendum to cancel the law, but a last-minute deal repealed AB 257 and substituted AB 1228, which set a $20 minimum wage and removed a threat to the franchise system.

Critics argue that the data shows the wage increase has led to job losses, particularly among vulnerable workers like youth from low-income households. The effects of the law will likely be debated extensively, and could have implications for the regulation of other industries. The outcome could be a harbinger of more direct regulation, for better or worse."

        "text": "Monday October 21, 2024  As we mark International Equal Pay Day, it is essential to reflect on the state of labour markets, particularly for women and youth, in Bangladesh. The vision of our younger generation is defined by a strong commitment to equality, fairness, and opportunities for decent work.\u00a0 However, the harsh reality is that the employment creation in Bangladesh has not kept pace with these expectations, leaving many young people, especially women, unemployed or trapped in low-paying jobs, facing wage unpredictability, and battling systemic barriers that hinder upward mobility. The disconnect between education and employment opportunities has resulted in frustration and disillusionment for many. Almost two million youth enter the labour force each year, yet many struggle to find jobs that match their qualifications, while those who do secure employment often start with salaries that are far below a liveable wage. There is a stark wage gap, and in sectors like agriculture, where women are heavily represented, women earn 31.51% less than men for the same work.\u00a0 On the demand side, employers often lament the lack of real workplace-relevant skills at all levels, pinpointing the need for reforms in education and training on market-relevant skills, including social skills, and through workplace learning like apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.\u00a0 One of the most pressing challenges is the unpredictability of wages. The wage-setting system in Bangladesh is often arbitrary and lacks transparency and fairness. Young workers, especially in the informal sector\u2014which accounts for around 85% of total employment\u2014are the most susceptible to unfair practices. The issue of low wages is often compounded with the lack of wage security, benefits, and the potential for career progression. This is a significant concern, as it leaves young people trapped in precarious employment conditions with little hope for wage growth or financial stability. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the national minimum wage increases have not kept up with inflation or living costs. According to the ILO's Global Wage Report, Bangladesh has seen one of the steepest declines in real wages among Asia-Pacific countries, with an annual decline rate of 5.9%. This means that while nominal wages may have risen, the purchasing power of those wages has diminished, leaving many workers, especially young people, worse off. A call for an evidence-based wage setting system There is a need for a comprehensive, evidence-based national wage-setting system. Such a system would provide predictability, fairness, and transparency in wage determination, ensuring that workers are paid according to the value of their labour and that wage adjustments reflect economic realities like inflation and cost of living.\u00a0 Establishing a wage-setting mechanism could also help bridge the gender wage gap and ensure that marginalised groups\u2014such as women, people with disabilities, and minority communities\u2014receive fair wages for their work. A national wage-setting system grounded in evidence could also play a vital role in poverty reduction. Bangladesh has made significant strides in setting minimum wages in the readymade garment sector, but it is time to extend this to other industries.\u00a0 A gender-inclusive wage policy, guided by the principles of International Labour Standards such as ILO Convention No 100 on Equal Remuneration, would be a powerful step toward ensuring that all workers, regardless of gender or background, are compensated fairly for their labour. Promoting wage transparency is another crucial step, as it would help unearth wage disparities and hold employers accountable for closing pay gaps. Other compounded systemic barriers to youth employment In addition to wage-setting issues, there are other systemic barriers that prevent young people in Bangladesh from meaningful participation in the labour market. These equally deserve our attention and include the mismatch between market demand and supply in terms of skills and competencies, poor quality of education and skills training systems and absence of critical employment support functions, like career counselling. In addition, the informality of employment and the absence of social security provisions for the workers are additional structural and governance challenges that young people face, making them more susceptible to working poverty. Young women, overseas workers and marginalised communities are particularly vulnerable to all these challenges, while also facing additional barriers, both structural and cultural. The role of youth in driving change Despite the significant challenges youth face in Bangladesh's labour market, they are uniquely positioned to drive meaningful reform. With their energy and passion for justice, young people are already pushing for greater transparency, fair wage-setting mechanisms, and gender equity. Youth-led organisations are playing a key role in raising awareness about wage disparities and advocating for more inclusive labour market policies. Engaging youth in creating robust labour market institutions and involving them in policy dialogues is essential for building a fairer, more transparent workforce. Supporting youth participation in trade unions and employers' organisations would also amplify their voices in critical discussions about labour rights and wages. On this International Equal Pay Day, let us therefore reaffirm our commitment to creating a labour market that serves all\u2014especially youth, who represent the future of Bangladesh. By addressing wage disparities and promoting transparency, we can build a prosperous and just Bangladesh where every young person can thrive. From ILO's side, we remain committed to supporting these efforts in collaboration with the interim government, workers, and employers' organisations. \u00a0Tuomo Poutiainen is the Country Director of ILO in Bangladesh.

        "summary": "As International Equal Pay Day is marked, it's essential to reflect on Bangladesh's labour markets, particularly for women and youth. The country's employment creation has not kept pace with expectations, leaving many young people unemployed or in low-paying jobs. A stark wage gap exists, with women in agriculture earning 31.51% less than men for the same work. The wage-setting system in Bangladesh lacks transparency and fairness, with young workers in the informal sector being the most susceptible to unfair practices. The national minimum wage increases have not kept up with inflation or living costs, resulting in a decline in real wages. There is a need for a comprehensive, evidence-based national wage-setting system to ensure predictability, fairness, and transparency. Such a system could help bridge the gender wage gap and ensure fair wages for marginalized groups. Bangladesh has made progress in setting minimum wages in the readymade garment sector, but it's time to extend this to other industries. Young people in Bangladesh face systemic barriers to employment, including a mismatch between market demand and supply, poor quality of education, and lack of social security provisions. Youth-led organizations are pushing for greater transparency and fair wage-setting mechanisms, and engaging youth in policy dialogues is essential for building a fairer workforce."

Featured Submit a story Tell us your story. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tBy: \t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tChris Dorrell\t\t\t\t\t\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tEconomics Reporter\t\t\t\t\t\t\n Business groups are worried about the potential impact of Labour\u2019s workers rights package as well as a likely six per cent increase in the minimum wage next year. A new survey from the Institute of Directors (IoD) found that a majority (57 per cent) of business leaders will be less likely to hire as a result of the government\u2019s workers\u2019 rights package. Some 36 per cent said the reforms would have no impact on firms\u2019 hiring intentions while just two per cent said it would make them more likely to hire. The survey makes apparent the extent of business concern over the new deal for workers, which is one of the most controversial aspects of Labour\u2019s legislative agenda. The package, which the government claims is \u201cunashamedly pro-worker and pro-business\u201d, includes a ban on \u201cexploitative\u201d zero hours contracts and will give workers day-one employment rights. Ministers will put an employment rights bill before Parliament in October, but it is not yet clear which specific measures will be included in the bill. Alexandra Hall-Chen, principal policy advisor for employment at the IoD, said business leaders were concerned about the costs that might be imposed by the new reforms. \u201cIt is essential that the government starts to meaningfully engage with business on the detail of its proposed reforms to ensure that its growth mission is not derailed,\u201d she added. The IoD\u2019s survey comes after the Low Pay Commission (LPC) said that it expects to increase the national living wage to \u00a312.10 from April next year, an increase of 5.8 per cent on its current level. The figure reflects the updated remit that the LPC has been asked to consider, which requires that the living wage does not drop below two-thirds of average earnings. The government has also asked the LPC to take account of the cost of living. The LPC noted that there was substantial uncertainty over the figure, suggesting it could come anywhere in a range of \u00a311.82-\u00a312.39. Nevertheless, the size of the increase sparked some concern among business groups, particularly after the near 11 per cent increase that took place this April.  \u201cWith the National Living Wage set to rise, it\u2019s vital that small firms have the support they need to reduce the pressure that higher wage costs will put on their finances,\u201d Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said. According to research from the FSB, 64 per cent of small firms adopted more risk-averse recruitment practices after April\u2019s increase in the minimum wage.  Hall-Chen at the IoD said that the combined impact of the workers rights\u2019 package and a higher minimum wage would be \u201cconsiderable disincentives\u201d for employers to hire.  It comes as a survey revealed small businesses are more unprepared than bigger firms for the government\u2019s slated reforms to workers\u2019 rights, such as banning zero-hours contracts. One in six \u2013 or 17 per cent \u2013 of small businesses, with under 249 workers, said they are \u2018not aware\u2019 of the new employment rights legislation Labour is preparing to bring in, while this figure dropped to 14 per cent for all UK firms, according to Savanta\u2019s business tracker. Some six in ten \u2013 or 62 per cent \u2013 of companies said they were prepared for implementation of the new legislation if it passes through Parliament as expected, the survey found. Matt McGinn, from Savanta said: \u201cLabour\u2019s ambitious workers\u2019 rights and employment proposals have become a bit of a lightning rod for criticism since the election. \u201cIn particular our research would suggest smaller businesses are the least prepared for the changes, and are much more likely to say the potential reforms will be difficult to implement.\u201d A spokesperson for the Department of Business and Trade said: \u201cWe are changing the rules to put more money in working people\u2019s pockets. But we have also been clear we need to consider the businesses who pay these wages, employment prospects and the impact on the wider economy.\u201d They added: \u201cWe continue to work closely with businesses and will ensure employers can operate fair and transparent probation periods so they can hire with confidence. \u201cThe majority of employers support the government\u2019s proposals to strengthen employment rights, with a recent survey of bosses showing they think it would be positive for productivity, staff retention and profits.\u201d \n\t\t\t\tShare this article\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe to the City AM newsletter to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tFollow us for breaking news and latest updates\t\t\t \n\t\tSubscribe to get the essential daily news updates from City AM's top stories to your inbox.\t",

Germany's Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil said on Monday that a significant increase of the national minimum wage is necessary to keep up with the rising cost of living. A member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling Social Democrats (SPD), Heil said that without this increase, Germany risked violating an EU directive. Heil said in a television interview on German public broadcaster ARD that the move was about \"having a reliable minimum wage so that people can make a living from their work.\" \"Six million people will benefit from this\" immediately, he said, adding that by \"2026, the minimum wage will be between 14 and 15 euros.\"\u00a0 Germany's current federal minimum wage is \u20ac12.41 ($13.70) per hour. Heil's comments came as he prepared to report to the\u00a0Minimum Wage Commission, which he\u00a0was obligated to do by November. The move will also bring Germany in line with EU regulations about how high the minimum wage must be in relation to medium income, he said.

They accused Heil of trying to win political\u00a0points and said it would \"weaken Germany as a business destination\" and hurt the competitiveness of small businesses.

        "text": "by Luzmila Freese Barely two months ago, Seattle gig workers began earning minimum wage for the first time. Here at the Latino Community Fund (LCF), we are led by and serve Latino and immigrant community members who share a vision of a brighter, stronger economic future for us all that includes living wages for us all. We know a truly healthy economy is one in which Seattle's local businesses and workforce have the support they need. That's why we support efforts to make Seattle a great, affordable place to work, and requiring that app corporations pay workers fairly is an essential step toward that vision. At LCF we partner closely with Latino-owned businesses, the many Latino and Hispanic workers they employ, and our wider Latino community to build a strong, sustainable local economy that benefits every one of us. Business owners understand that they need customers to grow, and that the more money workers earn, the more they can spend. We know firsthand how much support small businesses need because we work with them every day. COVID-19 forced many to pivot their business models in order to survive, and owners came to us looking for training on things like how to accept online orders and use card readers. They were optimistic that apps like DoorDash and UberEats would help them grow and connect to new customers. But what they also found is that the app corporations increase the cost of doing business, and that small businesses often feel like they have no choice but to use them. The corporations put small businesses in a position of getting on board with their obscure policies, their fees, their app interfaces \u2014 or getting run over. And they treat gig workers similarly. Instead of using their much-lauded innovative technology to pay tens of thousands of workers in our city a minimum wage, the app corporations have massively raised fees \u2014 gouging customers, workers, and small businesses alike. Instead of good-faith efforts at building a balanced economy for employers and workers, the app companies have been hard at work causing frustration and confusion for all of us who use the apps. This response to the new minimum wage law shows that they are not concerned with supporting Seattle's small businesses. If the app corporations truly cared about the Seattle economy, they would eliminate excessive fees and stop fighting the common sense, time-tested policy the rest of us already support: minimum wage for workers. The small businesses we work with care about being good employers and paying workers a living wage. The app companies that are doing everything they can to avoid paying workers fairly, even while they offer billion-dollar stock buybacks and pay their CEOs million-dollar end-of-year bonuses, clearly do not. Rather than sending Seattleites' money to a handful of Silicon Valley CEOs, we should be keeping money here in our local economy. Raising gig worker pay means more money we can keep here at home in the pockets of workers who themselves are customers of our businesses and whose purchasing power is the backbone of our economy. Small Latino-owned businesses have needs that the City can help with, like long-term recovery from the impact of the pandemic, expanding operations infrastructure to scale, and training to integrate new technology and tools like digital marketing to reach new customers. We welcome additional support to ensure that our local economy can grow and thrive long-term, which depends on workers being paid fairly. Local businesses need to be surrounded by a local community who can afford what they sell. Raising wages will accomplish that. Letting a few big corporations have their way will not.

        "text": "Sign In Register In June, British Columbia\u2019s minimum wage increased from $16.75 per hour to $17.40, which is the highest of any province in the country. Proponents of the increase argue that it will reduce poverty\u2014but what does the evidence show? According to a 2021 study, 8.8 per cent of all Canadian workers earned the minimum wage. Of those minimum-wage earners, in British Columbia, just 7.9 per cent lived in households below the low-income cut-off or LICO, which is often used as a proxy for the poverty line.\u00a0 Put simply, 92.1 per cent of minimum-wage earners in British Columbia lived in households above the LICO threshold, mainly because most minimum-wage workers are not the primary breadwinners in their households, but are rather secondary or tertiary wage earners. Such an individual may be, for example, a spouse working part-time, or a school-aged child still living at home who works part-time. These results are borne out by a separate study, which analyzed the impact of minimum wages in Canada from 1997 to 2007 and found no statistically significant effect on poverty. Another study measured the impact of increases in the minimum wage from 1981 to 2004 and found that a 10-per-cent increase in the minimum wage was associated with a four-per-cent to six-per-cent increase in the percentage of families falling below the LICO threshold, due to a reduction in employment (and correspondingly, a reduction in income).\u00a0 Indeed, a vast body of empirical research shows that a higher minimum wage actually may hurt\u2014not help\u2014workers as it can have negative effects on employment. Why? Because as the cost of labour increases, employers tend to hire fewer workers (and may even fire workers), and/or reduce the number of work hours for their remaining workers. In other words, we shouldn\u2019t assume that minimum wage workers retain their employment or the number of hours available to work when the government increases the minimum wage. In fact, according to the evidence, both employment and work hours often decrease when minimum wages rise. And unfortunately, the least advantaged are often hardest hit, as younger and less educated workers often suffer the most job losses resulting from higher minimum wages. So, what should the government do? B.C. has some of the highest personal income tax rates in North America, particularly after the provincial NDP government\u2019s recent series of tax hikes, which were exacerbated by federal tax increases. Rather than increase the minimum wage, the government should cut taxes. Moreover, many government benefit programs are based on income, which means that workers at certain income levels will lose some of those benefits\u2014that is, their financial benefits will be \u201cclawed back\u201d\u2014as they earn additional income. At the same time, workers pay higher taxes as their income increases. Economists call this combined effect of clawed-back financial benefits and higher taxes the marginal effective tax rate, or METR. In B.C., METRs hit low-income families particularly hard. In fact, many low-income workers in B.C. take home 40 cents or less on each additional dollar earned due to the METR. Despite any rhetoric from Victoria, the vast majority of minimum-wage workers aren\u2019t poor, which means a higher minimum wage in B.C. won\u2019t meaningfully alleviate poverty. In fact, due to negative employment effects, a higher minimum wage hurts many B.C. workers. If the government wants to help B.C. workers deal with the rising cost of living, it should reduce taxes.

The minimum wage was introduced in 2011 with the initial rate set at HK$28 (US$3.58) an hour. Since May last year, it has been HK$40. There has been concern about what impact the new formula will have on business operating costs. Based on my calculation, if the formula had been adopted in 2011, the minimum wage would be about HK$41.7 an hour in 2024, only slightly higher than the current one. The minimum wage that comes into effect using the new formula will be a bit higher than what it would have been had the wage been calculated using the new formula from 2011 onwards, as it will be annually adjusted.

        "summary": "California's minimum wage for fast-food workers increased to $20 on April 1, a $4.50 jump from the previous rate. This increase is expected to benefit around 500,000 workers, but may also lead to layoffs and higher prices for consumers. Business owners are already feeling the strain, with some considering reducing labor hours to compensate for the increased costs. The wage hike is unprecedented, according to Raymond Sfeir, director of the A. Gary Anderson Center for Economic Research at Chapman University. Sfeir warns that the increase will bring layoffs, higher prices, and more use of technology in restaurants. Small business owners, who are the backbone of local economies, may be disproportionately affected. California's unemployment rate is already the highest in the country at 5.3%. The higher wage could kill 3% of jobs in the fast-food industry, adding 0.12 percentage points to the state's unemployment rate. Consumers are also feeling the pinch, with prices rising 3.2% in February and 7%, 6.5%, and 3.4% in previous years. The overall effect of the wage hike will not be known for several months."

        "text": " \nBy\n\nRon Fink\n\n Attention minimum wage workers, the government is here to help you\u2014or is it? The U.S. census estimates that the median household income in Lompoc was $66,947 in 2023 and that 17 percent of the population was living in poverty. In Santa Maria the median income was $81,237 and 13.5 percent of the population lives in poverty. These facts cause the political class to convene panels and small working groups to \u201chave conversations\u201d about the issue; the result is always bad policy. California has been governed by one political party for generations, and the divide between low, medium, and high income has become wider every year because of their shortsighted policy decisions. This year is no different; even though voters were convinced to approve a minimum wage increase to \u201chelp the poor\u201d a few years ago, the politicians are at it again. It didn\u2019t work then and won\u2019t work now. Why? State-level politicians, whose primary source of income comes from the fact that they can talk a good game but produce nothing tangible, can\u2019t understand that when you raise the minimum wage the cost of everything low-income earners buy goes up. Folks who earn minimum wage are hardworking people, but the jobs they do don\u2019t command large sums of money. These are usually jobs that don\u2019t require special skills or advanced degrees but still need to be accomplished to provide needed services. Many people start at a minimum wage job and work their way up the wage ladder by seeking more challenging jobs. In November, voters will be asked to approve Proposition 32 which proposes to increase the minimum wage to $18 per hour. That sounds nice, but will it help low-income workers and their families? Not really. In a recent Noozhawk report, CalMatters reported that in California \u201cMIT researchers estimate the average single, childless adult needs $27 an hour to be \u2018self-sufficient.\u2019\u201d I am not an economist, but it looks like it\u2019s a fool\u2019s folly to think that continuously raising the lowest wage will ever elevate people out of poverty. Just look at your weekly household budget; it doesn\u2019t matter what income bracket you are in, your cost of living has increased dramatically during the last couple of years, and even though you spend more you are getting less bang for the buck.\u00a0 It may only be coincidental, but cost increases seem to track with minimum wage increases, thus for the low-income worker the wage increase has always been nullified by increased costs to survive. If raising the minimum wage isn\u2019t the answer, what is? One way to improve family wealth is to reduce the cost to produce what people need. Mounds of regulations designed to save whatever the current concern activists champion just raises the cost of everything from broccoli to a home to live in. Stopping fossil fuel production and mandating limited-range electric vehicles adds more cost to everything we use. Green energy requirements raise the cost of everything from electricity to the cost to construct new buildings or replacing your water heater. The politicians who voters have elected have really messed this one up. Sacramento can\u2019t mandate a living wage to help ease poverty; they have tried, and it didn\u2019t work. Fixing it at this point by trying to stem the upward spiral of the cost of necessities may be impossible. Here locally, a recent report said that Peter Rupert, director of the UCSB Economic Forecast Project, is concerned that \u201cmiddle-age residents are leaving the area and taking their children with them\u201d (Noozhawk, \u201cOfficials Outline Potential Threats to Santa Barbara County\u2019s Economy,\u201d Aug. 23). This, he says, among other things will have \u201can effect on the county long-term.\u201d Why are they leaving? Well, they can\u2019t afford to live here, and in many cases their employers have packed up and moved because of high costs and they simply followed their job out of state. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if politicians stopped trying to fix things they don\u2019t understand. Ron Fink writes to the Sun from Lompoc.

Instead, politicians' policies have only led to increased costs and a wider income gap. The author concludes that politicians should stop trying to fix things they don't understand and focus on reducing the cost of living."

She is also a visiting fellow in workforce at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a pro-growth research group that advocates for less government intervention. The views expressed here are her own. Read\u00ac\u2020more opinion\u00ac\u2020at CNN.\n \n            Across the United States,\u00ac\u2020about half of all states\u00ac\u2020raised their minimum wages in 2024. Most of those increases went into effect on January 1, while minimum wage hikes also went into effect in Nevada, Oregon, the District of Columbia and various localities on July 1.\u00ac\u2020But the mandated pay increases aren\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t necessarily good news. In particular, the recent wage hikes could deliver the most unintended consequences to the very people they most seek to help.\n     \n            Take California, for example. At $16 per hour, the Golden State has the second-highest statewide minimum wage. It recently\u00ac\u2020imposed a special minimum wage of $20 per hour for fast-food workers.\u00ac\u2020Already, it\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s been\u00ac\u2020a minor disaster.\u00ac\u2020Since the hourly pay raises, scores of fast-food businesses have shut down across the state. The Wall Street Journal\u00ac\u2020reported\u00ac\u2020that some fast-food establishments didn\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t even wait for California\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s new wage law to go into effect and began laying off staff and scaling back workers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 hours before the law went into effect.\n     \n            And that\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s not just true in California. Across the country, some of the hardest hit among the millions of people impacted by job losses or reduced hours following minimum wage increases are fast-food workers.\n     \n            A McDonald\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s advertising campaign boasts that\u00ac\u2020one in eight Americans\u00ac\u2020has worked at the fast-food chain. That figure holds true for my household of eight. My husband was once a McDonald\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s employee. My first foray into the workforce was also as a fast-food worker, as a Pizza Hut employee.\u00ac\u2020But while we both started off in minimum-wage jobs, I\u201a\u00c4\u00f4m happy to report that neither of us is still at the bottom rungs of the earnings ladder. Our fast-food jobs were an important entree, however, into the world of work.\n     \nRelated article\nOpinion: Why Americans are so frustrated with the economy right now\n \n            That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s true for many Americans. They start out in minimum-wage jobs, but don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t stay there for long. Today, fewer than\u00ac\u2020one out of every 1,000 workers\u00ac\u2020earns the minimum wage, and 60% of those who do are under age 25.\n     \n            That\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s a good thing, because the minimum wage can\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t support a family. But minimum-wage jobs are important stepping-stones, allowing workers to gain experience and move up to higher-paying jobs. Those jobs will become increasingly inaccessible however if lawmakers continue to increase the wages employers must pay to fill them.\n     \n            Numerous cities and states are going full steam ahead with plans to raise wages for entry-level workers. On July 1, Chicago\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s\u00ac\u2020hourly minimum wage increased\u00ac\u2020to $16.20. Oregon\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s minimum wage rose to $17. And\u00ac\u2020 where I live\u201a\u00c4\u00eein Montgomery County, Maryland just outside of Washington, DC \u201a\u00c4\u00ee the minimum wage rose to\u00ac\u2020$17.15 for companies with more than 50 employees.\n     \n            In Congress, some two dozen Democratic senators, including US Sen. Bernie Sanders, a longtime champion of the $15 minimum wage, are now pushing for a federal minimum wage of\u00ac\u2020at least $17 per hour.\n     \n            Rising wages are a great thing when they are the natural result of workers becoming more productive. Pay increases that result from government mandates can eliminate entry-level job opportunities and lead to a cascade of other unintended consequences.\n     \n            Consider how inflation recently increased the costs of everything from groceries to gas to rent. People resent paying more for the things they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re used to buying. They either have to do without,\u00ac\u2020find less expensive alternatives or figure out a way to make more money.\u00ac\u2020The same is true for employers. When their labor costs go up, they either have to cut their costs or increase their revenues. That can include reducing employee benefits or eliminating jobs, increasing their use of automation, or raising their prices for consumers.\n     \nRelated article\nOpinion: The economy is strong, but it might not be enough for Biden\n \nIn a report\u00ac\u2020published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists who examined every study on the minimum wage in the US over the past three decades concluded that there was a \u201a\u00c4\u00faclear preponderance\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 of employment losses as the minimum wage rose, with teens, young adults, and less-educated workers experiencing the greatest losses. In other words, increases in the minimum wage often hurt the very people they\u201a\u00c4\u00f4re meant to help.\n     \n            In short, high minimum-wage laws cut off the bottom rung of the career ladder, effectively pricing the least-advantaged workers out of employment. In South Carolina,\u00ac\u2020researchers found\u00ac\u2020that the most recent minimum wage hike reduced employment by 8.9% for teens, and by 15.5% for workers with less than a high school diploma.\n     \n            A $17 minimum wage \u201a\u00c4\u00ee as called for in the federal Raise the Wage Act of 2023 \u201a\u00c4\u00ee means that employers would pay about $42,000 per year for a full-time worker when\u00ac\u2020including all mandatory wages, benefits and taxes. Since many young\u00ac\u2020and less educated workers are simply not capable of producing that much value right out of the gate, they could be priced out of the job market entirely. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a $17 minimum wage would cause 350,000 disproportionately younger and less educated individuals to\u00ac\u2020drop out\u00ac\u2020of the labor force entirely.\n     \n            Even workers who keep their jobs and receive higher wages can end up worse off, because employers may make up for higher wage costs by reducing employee benefits.\u00ac\u2020A\u00ac\u2020recent study\u00ac\u2020of retail workers in Texas and California found that a $1, or 9.1% minimum wage increase translated into an 11.6%\u00ac\u2020decrease\u00ac\u2020in total compensation for the average California worker.\n     \n            Some employers compensate by automating low-skill functions, like replacing workers with self-service kiosks.\u00ac\u2020Or, as mentioned above, they raise prices. Since lower-income families spend\u00ac\u2020a higher percentage of their incomes\u00ac\u2020at places like grocery stores and fast-food restaurants, where low-profit margins necessitate larger price increases, they can be disproportionately hurt by minimum-wage-induced price hikes.\n     \n            Moreover, my analysis found that a $17 minimum wage would\u00ac\u2020increase child care costs\u00ac\u2020by more than $7,000 per year for families in low-cost states like\u00ac\u2020Iowa and Kansas, but by less than $900 in high-cost states like Massachusetts and California.\u00ac\u2020In short, family-supporting wages are fundamental to personal and societal well-being, but all that minimum wage laws can accomplish is to make it illegal for employers to hire individuals who don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t yet have enough experience and education to cover the cost of employing them at artificially high minimum wages.\n     \n            Instead of wage mandates,\u00ac\u2020policymakers should help workers achieve real and lasting income gains without unintended consequences. That\u00ac\u2020should start with\u00ac\u2020expanding alternative education options like apprenticeships, reducing unnecessary burdens on employers that subtract from workers\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 wages and eliminating government-imposed barriers to employment, such as unnecessary occupational licensing standards and restrictions on flexible independent work.\n     \n            To prevent employers from giving pink slips to people who want and need to work, policymakers should give pink slips to minimum wage hikes that simply don\u201a\u00c4\u00f4t work.\n     \u00ac\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "summary": "Across the US, many states have raised their minimum wages, but these increases may have unintended consequences, particularly for the people they aim to help.

        "text": "e-Edition Get the latest news delivered daily!  Get the latest news delivered daily! e-Edition \n\t\t\tTrending:\t\t On April 1, the new California $20-per-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers went into effect. In signing the bill, California Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected the view that such a wage hike \u2014 25% above the state\u2019s current minimum wage \u2014 hurts teenagers who disproportionately benefit from fast-food jobs and for whom this becomes their entry into the job market. Newsom said: \u201cThat\u2019s a romanticized version of a world that doesn\u2019t exist. We have the opportunity to reward that contribution, reward that sacrifice and stabilize an industry.\u201dIn 2019, The New York Times editorial board echoed the theme:\u201cThe simplistic view that minimum-wage laws cause unemployment commanded such a broad consensus in the 1980s that this editorial board came out against the federal minimum in 1987, calling it \u2018an idea whose time has passed,\u2019 and citing as evidence \u2018a virtual consensus among economists.\u2019 The old critique is still put forward regularly by the restaurant industry and other major employers of low-wage workers \u2026\u201cA groundbreaking study published in 1993 by the economists David Card and Alan Krueger examined a minimum-wage rise in New Jersey by comparing fast-food restaurants there and in an adjacent part of Pennsylvania. It found no impact on employment.\u201dThe 2019 New York Times editorial board has done a 180-degree turn from what its board wrote in a 1987 opinion headlined \u201cThe Right Minimum Wage: $0.00\u201d:\u201c\u2026 there\u2019s a virtual consensus among economists that the minimum wage is an idea whose time has passed. Raising the minimum wage by a substantial amount would price working poor people out of the job market \u2026\u201cA higher minimum would undoubtedly raise the living standard of the majority of low-wage workers who could keep their jobs. That gain, it is argued, would justify the sacrifice of the minority who became unemployable. The argument isn\u2019t convincing. Those at greatest risk from a higher minimum would be young, poor workers, who already face formidable barriers to getting and keeping jobs.\u201dIn a 1973 interview, Nobel economics prize winner Milton Friedman said, \u201cI\u2019ve often said the minimum-wage rate is the most anti-Negro law on the books.\u201d\n\nNow the \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d Card-Krueger study referred to in The New York Times 2019 editorial did, in fact, refute the consensus among economists that government-imposed minimum wage increases cause unemployment and higher prices and give added incentive to cut labor costs through automation. But about the study, The New York Times\u2019 own columnist, economist and Nobel winner Paul Krugman, wrote:\u201cIndeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages, but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages \u2018do,\u2019 in fact, reduce employment. \u2026\u201d (Krugman now supports a minimum wage.)Related Articles\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tLetter: Trump is the fighter America needs\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tRepublican candidates missing so far from California\u2019s next race for governor\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\t\u2018Degrowth\u2019 theorists plot a world of poverty and misery\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tCarlos Perea: Vote yes on Santa Ana Measure DD.

In 2019, The New York Times editorial board echoed the theme: \u201cThe simplistic view that minimum-wage laws cause unemployment commanded such a broad consensus in the 1980s that this editorial board came out against the federal minimum in 1987, calling it \u2018an idea whose time has passed,\u2019 and citing as evidence \u2018a virtual consensus among economists.\u2019 The old critique is still put forward regularly by the restaurant industry and other major employers of low-wage workers \u2026 \u201cA groundbreaking study published in 1993 by the economists David Card and Alan Krueger examined a minimum-wage rise in New Jersey by comparing fast-food restaurants there and in an adjacent part of Pennsylvania. It found no impact on employment.\u201d The 2019 New York Times editorial board has done a 180-degree turn from what its board wrote in a 1987 opinion headlined \u201cThe Right Minimum Wage: $0.00\u201d: \u201c\u2026 there\u2019s a virtual consensus among economists that the minimum wage is an idea whose time has passed. Raising the minimum wage by a substantial amount would price working poor people out of the job market \u2026 \u201cA higher minimum would undoubtedly raise the living standard of the majority of low-wage workers who could keep their jobs. That gain, it is argued, would justify the sacrifice of the minority who became unemployable. The argument isn\u2019t convincing. Those at greatest risk from a higher minimum would be young, poor workers, who already face formidable barriers to getting and keeping jobs.\u201d In a 1973 interview, Nobel economics prize winner Milton Friedman said, \u201cI\u2019ve often said the minimum-wage rate is the most anti-Negro law on the books.\u201d Now the \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d Card-Krueger study referred to in The New York Times 2019 editorial did, in fact, refute the consensus among economists that government-imposed minimum wage increases cause unemployment and higher prices and give added incentive to cut labor costs through automation. But about the study, The New York Times\u2019 own columnist, economist and Nobel winner Paul Krugman, wrote: \u201cIndeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages, but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages \u2018do,\u2019 in fact, reduce employment. \u2026\u201d (Krugman now supports a minimum wage.)

        "summary": "California's new minimum wage of $20 per hour for fast-food workers went into effect on April 1. Governor Gavin Newsom rejected the idea that this wage hike would hurt teenagers who rely on these jobs. The New York Times editorial board previously opposed the federal minimum wage, citing a consensus among economists that it would cause unemployment. However, in 2019, the board reversed its stance, citing a \"groundbreaking\" study by economists David Card and Alan Krueger that found no impact on employment. This study compared fast-food restaurants in New Jersey, which raised its minimum wage, to those in adjacent Pennsylvania, which did not. However, other economists have attacked the study, pointing out that it relied on employer surveys rather than payroll records, which showed lower employment in the state with the higher minimum wage. Nobel economics prize winner Milton Friedman once called the minimum-wage rate \"the most anti-Negro law on the books.\" The Card-Krueger study has been widely cited, but its findings are disputed, and many economists believe that minimum wages do reduce employment. Ohio University economist Lowell Galloway denounced the study as flawed and politically motivated. The debate over the minimum wage continues, with proponents arguing it helps low-wage workers and opponents arguing it hurts the very people it is intended to help."

So it ends up hurting people.\u201d\u00a0 While efficient, automation like those ordering screens at the Minneapolis airport is emblematic of what happens when the government distorts the marketplace with a heavy-handed regulatory approach.\u00a0 Minneapolis has mandated a $15.57 hourly minimum wage \u2013 more than twice the federal minimum wage of $7.25 \u2013 for large employers, but that wage will apply to all businesses starting this summer. While the airport isn\u2019t technically part of any city, its employers are no doubt forced to offer comparable wages to attract workers.\u00a0 High wages are having other effects, too. Minneapolis residents will soon be out of luck if they want to call an Uber or a Lyft. Both companies are leaving town in May after the ultra-liberal city council (several of the 13 are declared socialists) applied the minimum wage to drivers, overriding the mayor\u2019s veto. The companies said the mandate makes operations in the city unsustainable.\u00a0 So in the effort to increase pay for drivers, the city council effectively will strip thousands of jobs and leave many people without transportation.\u00a0 As Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey said in an interview, \u201cGetting a raise doesn\u2019t do a whole lot of good if you lose your job.\u201d Nice work, Minneapolis. Then there\u2019s California. In what should have been an April Fools\u2019 joke, a law requiring fast-food workers at large chains to earn $20 a hour took effect April 1.\u00a0 Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the law last year. Obviously, businesses aren\u2019t happy because it's bad for their bottom lines.\u00a0 Biden's new rule may take your job:Biden claims to stand for women, but his new regulation will kill jobs that women want Newsom admitted as much when he tried to give his buddy Greg Flynn, who runs Panera Bread franchises in California, a loophole from the law. Flynn is a big Newsom donor, and Newsom had demanded a curious exemption to the law for restaurants \u201cmaking in-house bread.\u201d\u00a0 After the justified uproar that Flynn was getting special favors, he has said he\u2019ll abide by the higher wage. It\u2019s no surprise that even before the new minimum wage became reality, restaurants started planning layoffs. For instance, Pizza Hut has said it will cut more than 1,000 delivery jobs. Many more are following suit. As any economist could have predicted, these businesses are having to downsize their workforce, reduce hours and raise prices. That\u2019s what happens when the government meddles in the private market.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to see how this benefits anyone in the long run. Minimum wage jobs have traditionally existed to give people an entry point into the work world, but government-driven inflated wages will take those opportunities away from inexperienced workers.\u00a0 And this government intervention ignores that workers have more choices than ever.\u00a0 \u201cIt\u2019s such a competitive marketplace and unemployment is so low that if you\u2019re disappointed in the job in either the culture or the wage or the working conditions, you can move,\u201d Wesbury said. You can always count on Congress\u2019 resident socialist, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, to come up with truly wild (and costly) ideas. He\u2019s a constant pusher of \u201cfree\u201d college, student debt forgiveness and high minimum wages. Employers must speak up:Biden's overtime pay proposal is the last thing our economy needs Sanders also says Americans deserve a 32-hour work week. Employers would be forced to continue paying workers the same pay and benefits as they get for working 40 hours. And he\u2019s not just thinking about it \u2013 he\u2019s introduced a bill.\u00a0 Sounds pretty darn good, I have to say.\u00a0 Unfortunately, in the real world, companies would have to make adjustments to afford this cushy new employee benefit. Employers would either have to hire more workers or lose out on productivity, and consumers would face higher prices as a result.\u00a0Other unintended consequences would surely follow.

        "text": "Alright. Let\u2019s talk about the rising minimum wage and its profound, devastating implications for the cost of living in California. I recently tried to enroll my child in a summer camp through the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, and guess what? We were met with fewer spots and a whopping 33% price hike. Why? The department is struggling to find enough counselors who are willing to work for $18 an hour. Sure, it\u2019s more than the city\u2019s current minimum wage, but here\u2019s the real kicker: In April, the statewide minimum wage for fast-food workers is going to hit $20 an hour. If that wasn\u2019t bad enough, we can bet that these kinds of wage increases won\u2019t be limited to fast-food workers, and L.A. won\u2019t stop at just $20 an hour.\u00a0 Of course, recent wage increases throughout California haven\u2019t been confined to seasonal temporary jobs like summer camps. Hospitals across the state are also being forced to raise their wages for their lowest-wage employees to an astronomical $25 an hour. Great news for the employees, right? Well, not quite. The reality is that doing so will set off a domino effect of rising costs for patients and, ultimately, a mass worker exodus from Los Angeles and California.\u00a0 Consider the impending $20 hourly minimum wage for fast-food workers in the Golden State, set to take effect in April. The implications are dire, especially in cities like Los Angeles, where the cost of living is already skyrocketing. As we witness these wage hikes, everyone \u2013 from the business community and government officials to affected employees themselves \u2013 must recognize that increased labor costs will inevitably be passed down the supply chain, affecting everything from goods and services to the overall cost of living. And no one is prepared to pay $15 for a Big Mac.\u00a0 Now, if a worker can pull in $52,000 a year in cities like Turlock, where one-bedroom apartments are being rented out for a little over $1,000 a month, why should anyone stick around in L.A.? Especially when our elected officials are turning the screws on landlords and developers, making prices spiral even more out of control. So, what\u2019s the bottom line? Expect changes. Big ones. Although unions and social justice warriors might throw a fit, astronomical labor costs will force countless businesses to cut their staff and shift to automation, because doing so will be the difference between surviving and shutting their doors.\u00a0 This alarming scenario raises important questions about the sustainability of California\u2019s economic model. While the state\u2019s $16 hourly minimum wage might sound like a leap forward for economic justice to some, it falls short when coupled with the increased costs that are the result. The state\u2019s Legislative Analyst\u2019s Office even crunched the numbers for us, and, surprise, surprise, they\u2019re not adding up.\u00a0 Wage hikes will cause other changes Also, in case you missed it, a recent report by the Hoover Institution revealed that hundreds of businesses decided to wave goodbye to California between 2018 and 2022. And that doesn\u2019t even include the businesses that just closed their doors. Why? High rent, high taxes and high employee living costs, not to mention enough red tape to strangle plenty of business owners. That doesn\u2019t quite sound like a love letter to hard-working Californians, does it?\u00a0 As the state grapples with many economic challenges, it is paramount that we balance pursuits for fair wages with economic sustainability; otherwise, our state will be ravaged by increased costs and job losses that disproportionately harm small businesses and underserved communities. So, policymakers need to engage in meaningful dialogue with stakeholders to ensure fair compensation that doesn\u2019t damage California\u2019s prosperity. Although higher wages are a noble idea, let\u2019s not kid ourselves: There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. As the minimum wage climbs, costs do, too, and someone\u2019s going to be picking up the tab. So, before throwing a party when everyday workers start raking in $20 or more an hour, let\u2019s take a step back to make sure that our leaders aren\u2019t marching the state into financial ruin. California\u2019s economic future is on the line, and it\u2019s about time that we put a stop to counterproductive, pie-in-the-sky proposals.

        "text": "Amanda Rose is the founder and CEO of Entrepreneurial and Small Business Women Australia. Source: Supplied. Effective July 1, the minimum and award wage will increase by 3.75% which will see the national minimum wage go up to $24.10 per hour or $913.19 per week based on a 38-hour week. At any other time, this would have been widely accepted as the price of progress, but during an unprecedented crisis in the small business sector, this is a callous kick in the guts. As inflation pushes up the cost of labour, goods, and materials across the board, it\u2019s understandable that the Fair Work Commission wants to ensure those who earn the least in this country can survive in the current cost of living crisis. It\u2019s an inconvenient truth however that small business owners are among those who are earning little to nothing as they are forced to take on multiple roles in order to stay afloat. What\u2019s even more sad is that small business owners are blamed for having small profit margins when in actual fact they have been struggling since the government locked us down. These decisions crippled small business and with the rise in the cost of doing business in Australia, it\u2019s now catastrophic. An unpalatable fact about small business owners is that they work more than the average 38-hour week. A survey found that a quarter of small business owners are clocking in more than 50+ hours per week. At the same time, the latest report from ASBFEO shows 27% of businesses have a turnover of $0 to less than $50,000. A further 32% bring in between $50,000 and $200,000. Out of these paltry earnings, business owners are expected to pay wages, tax, their suppliers, and other expenses associated with the cost of running a business. Finally, if they are lucky, they get to take some of it home for themselves. Cash flow is tight and business owners would rather sacrifice paying themselves to keep their business running. Even a small increase to the minimum wage could wipe out slender profit margins from small businesses and in many cases leave them in the red. What follows is mass closure, empty shop fronts, and derelict streets. This scenario is already playing out as ABS data reflects the dire situation many SMEs are dealing with right now. In 2022-23 the entry rate of new businesses is 16% compared to the exit rate of 14%. Hospitality and construction are in strife and the numbers rolling in show there\u2019s been an increase in unemployment. Australia\u2019s biggest employer also happens to be small businesses. Put two and two together and it\u2019s no surprise that anti-small business government policies have finally come home to roost. What is the solution? Common sense dictates Labor immediately needs to stop adding financial pressures to the small business sector. Small businesses don\u2019t need cybersecurity funding as much as they need meaningful tax breaks and rebates. Instead of expecting small business owners to single-handedly bear the cost of living burden, the government should step in to make it easier for them to hold onto their employees. For instance, entry-level roles should equate to entry-level wages to keep the labour market affordable for employers. After all, it\u2019s better to have a job than to have no job at all if small businesses end up folding. Small business owners are some of the hardest working people in the country yet they\u2019re being openly persecuted for simply having a go. The irony of small business owners dipping into savings, forgoing holidays, sick leave, and compassionate leave to keep their business running while their employees enjoy mandated benefits points to the dysfunctional relationship the government has with this incredibly important sector. In light of such facts, it\u2019s no wonder younger generations aren\u2019t stepping up to start the next generation of small businesses. One can only hope legislators take notice and act to save small businesses before more disappear. Amanda Rose is the founder and CEO of Entrepreneurial and Small Business Women Australia.

        "text": "The minimum wage set by the government, known as the National Living Wage, is increasing by more than \u00a31 for the first time, providing a boost for 2.7 million low-paid workers. The main wage rate is rising from \u00a310.42 to \u00a311.44 an hour and will apply to workers over 21 rather than over 23. Younger workers will also see a rise in the rates that apply to them. However, some businesses say the higher labour costs will make it harder for them to keep prices down. The changes mean:  Samuel, who works at Grindsmith coffee house in Salford, is one of those who will benefit from the increase. The 26-year-old says before the pay hike he was left with about \u00a3400 at the end of the month after rent and bills were paid, but felt he was being left \"shorter and shorter\" each time. \"Maybe for a month you'll be like 'oh, I've got money this month' but next month will be a bit of a rough one,\" Samuel says. He says the increase in the minimum wage will make up for the way prices have been rising, and help him afford more than just the essentials. When setting the minimum wage, the government is guided by proposals from the Low Pay Commission. The rising cost of living prompted the independent commission to recommend a bigger rise in the minimum wage.  The government accepted the recommendation, saying it meant the Conservatives' target to \"end low pay\", by lifting the minimum wage to two-thirds of average earnings, had now been met. However, Samuel's employer, Peter Gibson, the director and co-founder of Grindsmith, says businesses are under strain from the rise in wage costs. An increase for the lowest paid means he has to boost wages for other staff to maintain a differential, he says. \"With such a large increase this time, the minimum wage is now catching up to what we would pay our supervisors, so there must be some inflation in their wages as well. \"So for us, as a small business, it's not just a pay increase for minimum wage [workers], it's a pay increase across the company,\" Mr Gibson says. To manage the rise in costs, the company will consider increasing prices and cutting staff hours, he adds. \"Our hand's being forced,\" he says. \"It's not to make the company more money, it's to make the exact same amount of money, at the end, but with higher prices.\" Business and trade minister Kevin Hollinrake conceded that rising wages meant rising costs for firms. \"We should never forget that private sector businesses shoulder the biggest burden in terms of paying the minimum wage,\" he told the BBC.\"But it is really good news for 2.7 million people.\" The Resolution Foundation, an independent think-tank, says the minimum wage increase represented a rise of 7.8% in real terms - once inflation was taken into account - and a 9.8% rise in cash terms. It says pay inequality had fallen significantly since 1999 when the minimum wage was introduced, making it \"the single most successful economic policy in a generation\".

The commission recommended a bigger rise due to the rising cost of living. The government accepted! the recommendation, meeting its target to \"end low pay\". However, businesses like Grindsmith coffee house say the higher labour costs will make it harder to keep prices down. Director Peter Gibson says the company may increase prices and cut staff hours to manage the rise in costs. The Resolution Foundation thinks the minimum wage increase is a significant rise in real terms, making it a successful economic policy."

About four-in-ten (38%) say they oppose the proposal, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 5-11. The Biden administration and many congressional Democrats favor increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current rate of $7.25 an hour, but the proposal\u2019s fate in the Senate is uncertain. Some senators, including several Democrats, support a more modest increase in the wage.  Pew Research Center conducted this study understand Americans\u2019 views on raising the standard federal minimum wage. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,109 U.S. adults in April 2021. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology. Among the public, those who back a $15 minimum wage are fairly divided over how to approach the issue if there is insufficient support in Congress for an increase to that amount this year. A narrow majority of these Americans (54%) say leaders should focus on passing an increase to the wage \u201ceven if it may be significantly less than $15 an hour,\u201d while 43% say the priority should be to work to raise the hourly minimum wage to $15 \u201ceven if no increase makes it into law this year.\u201d Among those who oppose\u00a0raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, a substantial majority (71%) say the federal minimum wage should be increased, but that the standard should be less than $15 an hour; those who hold this view account for 27% of the overall public. Only one-in-ten Americans in all say that federal minimum wage should remain at the current level of $7.25 an hour.  Support for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is extensive across most demographic groups, according to the survey, which was conducted among 5,109 U.S. adults. Black adults in particular stand out for their support: 89% favor raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, including 73% who support the idea strongly. About three-quarters of Hispanic (76%) and Asian Americans (73%) also favor raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, with 52% of Hispanics and 43% of Asians saying they strongly support the idea. White adults, by contrast, are divided: 51% favor raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour \u2013 including just 30% who strongly favor it \u2013 while 48% oppose it.  About seven-in-ten adults who live in lower-income households (72%) say they favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, including about half (52%) who strongly favor such an increase. Smaller majorities of those in middle- (58%) and upper-income households (55%) say they favor a $15 minimum wage. There are sharp partisan differences in opinions. While 87% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they favor increasing the wage to $15 an hour (including 61% who strongly favor it), 72% of Republicans and GOP leaners oppose the idea (including 45% who strongly oppose it).  People living in areas where the state-level minimum wage is currently $12 or higher are more likely than others to say they favor a federal increase to $15 an hour. About seven-in-ten adults in these places (69%) favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, compared with 59% of those living in places with a minimum wage of less than $12 an hour. While Democrats are largely united in their support for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, Republicans\u2019 views differ by household income. Lower-income Republicans (46%) are much more likely than middle- (23%) and upper-income Republicans (18%) to say they favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Still, a majority of lower-income Republicans (54%) say they oppose such an increase. Similarly, Republicans who live in areas where the state minimum wage is $12 or higher are slightly more likely than those living in places where the $7.25 federal minimum wage applies to say they favor raising the federal minimum to $15 an hour (32% vs. 25%).  Related post: When it comes to raising the minimum wage, most of the action is in cities and states, not Congress  More than half of Americans who favor a $15 federal minimum wage (54%) say that if there is not enough congressional support for such an increase this year, Congress should prioritize increasing the wage even if the new wage is significantly less than $15. These views differ by race and ethnicity, as well as by income. A majority of Black adults who favor a $15 standard (55%) say that if there is not sufficient support in Congress for that to pass, congressional leaders should continue to work for a $15 minimum wage even if no minimum wage increase becomes law this year. Half of Hispanic adults who back the $15 wage also express this view. By contrast, 36% of White adults who favor a $15 minimum wage say Congress should keep pressing for that amount. A majority of White supporters of a $15 federal minimum wage, by contrast, say Congress should work for an increase in the minimum wage even if it is less than $15 an hour.  Lower-income adults who favor a $15 minimum wage are divided on the better approach if there is inadequate support in Congress for the proposal this year: 49% say congressional leaders should prioritize any raise to the minimum that can happen this year, while an identical 49% share say leaders should continue working until they pass legislation raising the wage to $15 an hour. Among higher-income adults who support a $15 minimum wage, majorities say the priority for Congress should be to work to increase the minimum wage, even if the new wage is significantly less than $15 an hour.

Sign up for WeeklyMatters for a Saturday morning digest of the latest news and commentary from the Golden State. This story is part of California Voices, a commentary forum aiming to broaden our understanding of the state and spotlight Californians directly impacted by policy or its absence. Learn more here. Guest Commentary written by Michael Reich is an economics professor and chair of UC Berkeley\u2019s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment.  Justin Wiltshire is an assistant professor of economics at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, and an affiliate of UC Berkeley\u2019s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. Today, the minimum wage for California fast food workers will increase to $20 an hour, or 25% above the state\u2019s $16 level. And a first-of-its-kind fast food council will give workers, employers and state government the opportunity to come together and set standards for the industry. But rather than celebrating, many headlines are predicting mass layoffs, major burger price increases and even the end of fast food as we know it in California. These headlines reflect an unsophisticated understanding of an outmoded and simplistic theory: In Econ 101, if you increase the price of labor, employers will use less of it or pass along the higher costs to consumers.\u00a0 This explanation ignores that fast food restaurants have and use their power to set wages and employment levels well below the Econ 101 level. The modern theory of labor markets actually recognizes employers\u2019 wage-setting power and that a higher minimum wage can help overcome this power, ultimately raising both pay and employment.\u00a0 Outside the theoretical world, economists have conducted hundreds of studies on the actual effects of minimum wage. They repeatedly find that increasing the minimum wage raises the pay of low-wage workers, without leading to even minor job losses. Prices increase by minimal amounts that are too small to deter anyone from buying a burger or taco. Our latest contribution\u00a0to this research looked at what happened in fast food restaurants after California and New York nearly doubled their minimum wage to $15 over seven and a half years, from the end of 2013 to the beginning of 2022.\u00a0We compared federal data on fast food jobs in the 36 most populous counties in California and New York \u2013 where the minimum wage jumped dramatically \u2013 to similar combinations of counties in states that kept the minimum wage at the federal level of $7.25 an hour.\u00a0 We found that fast food employment in California and New York did not fall, compared to employment trends in the lower-wage areas. In fact, in the low-unemployment years after the pandemic, fast food employers in the $15 counties added workers.\u00a0 Pizza Hut operators in California recently announced they were laying off delivery drivers and would rely on Uber Eats, DoorDash and other gig delivery services. Analysts blamed the layoffs on the\u00a0new $20 pay floor. But Pizza Hut\u00a0began working with those services\u00a0in 2022 \u2013 not to save money but because they couldn\u2019t hire enough drivers. Other national pizza chains have already partnered with delivery companies. Recognizing all of this, a different question emerges: How do we square the absence of negative employment effects with the theory that higher wages means fewer jobs? The answer is power.  When employers have too much power in the labor market, they can (and do) pay workers considerably less. Workers take the low-paid jobs, often because they seem to be the best option available at the time. But those artificially low wages lead workers to quit when they find better-paying options \u2013 or when they\u2019re just tired of working for such low wages.  As a result, hiring and maintaining staffing levels becomes more difficult for employers, leaving them with unfilled vacancies.\u00a0 In recent years, fast food and other low-wage workers have reset the power equation. They have taken to the streets, city halls and state houses to demand better pay, and they have convinced politicians around the country to raise the minimum wage. By raising pay to meet the higher minimums, fast food restaurants were better able to attract workers to fill the vacant jobs. And those workers stayed longer.\u00a0 Lower employee turnover and fewer vacancies demonstrate how higher minimum wages can result in more jobs. Lower turnover also helps restaurant owners because more experienced workers will be more productive, while the owners save on recruitment and retention costs.\u00a0 What about prices? Won\u2019t fast-food customers pay a lot more because of the higher wages?\u00a0 Pundits claim that a 25% increase in the minimum wage means a 25% increase in prices. Again, the real world provides a different answer.  We examined how minimum wage increases in California and New York changed McDonald\u2019s prices. Every dollar increase in the minimum wage led McDonald\u2019s to raise the price of a $5 Big Mac by just 12 cents.\u00a0 Fast food companies are reporting higher\u00a0sales\u00a0and bigger\u00a0profits\u00a0than before the pandemic. They have absorbed higher wage costs and remained profitable without reducing fast food jobs. Time and time again, research \u2013 and reality \u2013 show that raising fast-food workers\u2019 pay in California will only lead to higher living standards for workers and a more equitable economy.

        "summary": "California's minimum wage for fast food workers is increasing to $20 an hour, and a new fast food council will set industry standards. Many headlines are predicting mass layoffs and price increases, but this is based on an outdated economic theory. In reality, increasing the minimum wage can help overcome employers' power to set low wages and raise employment levels. Hundreds of studies have shown that raising the minimum wage increases pay for low-wage workers without leading to job losses. A recent study found that fast food employment in California and New York did not fall after the minimum wage was nearly doubled. In fact, fast food employers in these areas added workers in low-unemployment years. The real reason for layoffs, such as those at Pizza Hut, is often due to difficulty hiring enough workers, not the higher minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage can actually lead to more jobs by reducing employee turnover and making it easier for employers to attract workers. Higher minimum wages have also been shown to have a minimal impact on prices, with a $1 increase in the minimum wage leading to a 12-cent increase in the price of a Big Mac. Overall, raising the minimum wage for fast food workers in California will lead to higher living standards and a more equitable economy."

        "text": "Pope Francis held Mass and urged migrant workers to be paid \"fairly\" as he visited the affluent city-state of Singapore on Thursday on the last stop of his long Asia-Pacific tour. The 87-year-old pontiff said \"special attention\" should be paid to \"protecting the dignity of migrant workers\" in an address to political leaders and dignitaries. \n \"These workers contribute greatly to society and should be guaranteed a fair wage,\" he said. There are an estimated 170 million migrant workers around the world. Most live in the Americas or Europe-Central Asia. \n Cheap labor has been instrumental in the rapid growth of gleaming metropolises such as Dubai, Doha and Singapore \u2013 the fourth stop on the pope's Asia tour. About 300,000 low-wage migrant workers are estimated to work in Singapore. Many flock from South Asia and the Philippines, which has a large and devout Catholic majority. Advocates say they are often exploited and endure poor living conditions, including forced dormitory lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I'm so happy that the pope has chosen to speak on this topic,\" a 34-year-old Filipina domestic helper told Agence France-Presse (AFP), asking not to be identified because she did not have permission from her employer. \n \"Even if they don't raise my salary, I'm still happy to know that the pope is fighting and praying for us,\" she said. The woman said she earned $460 a month in a nation where, according to Ministry for Manpower statistics, the median gross income is $3,985. The pope did not refer to workers in Singapore explicitly. However, his comments are likely to cause unease for a government that denies widespread abuse and is fiercely protective of its image. A spokesperson for the manpower ministry said conditions for workers in Singapore had improved over the years through contract enforcement and other measures. \"Wages in Singapore are determined by the free market and we do not prescribe minimum wages for workers in Singapore, whether local or foreign,\" the spokesperson told AFP. The Argentine pope was otherwise glowing about his hosts, praising the \"entrepreneurial spirit\" and dynamism that built a \"mass of ultra-modern skyscrapers that seem to rise from the sea.\" \"Singapore is a mosaic of ethnicities, cultures and religions living together in harmony,\" he said, painting the population of almost 6 million as a shining light for the world. \"I encourage you to continue to work in favor of the unity and fraternity of humanity and the common good of all peoples and all nations,\" he said. About 30% of Singaporeans are Buddhist, 20% have no religion and the rest are a mix of Catholic, Protestant, Taoist and Hindu. Singapore is the last stop on the pope's 12-day Asia-Pacific trip to boost the Catholic Church's standing in the world's most populous region. Francis has defied doubts about his health during a journey that has taken him from Jakarta's grand mosque to a remote jungle in Papua New Guinea. He has carried out dozens of public engagements, energized congregations and sat for hours in the brutal tropical heat despite recently undergoing hernia surgery and dealing with a string of respiratory issues. In East Timor, he held a mass for 600,000 faithful \u2013 almost half the population. Although the crowds were markedly smaller in Singapore, groups of enthusiasts still lined the streets, trying to glimpse the one they call the \"Holy Father.\" An estimated 50,000 people attended a mass in Singapore's national stadium on Thursday evening. \"Francis has this special ability to connect with the people, to touch people,\" said Eveena Job, 21, who was born in India but lives in Singapore with her family. Others did not make it into the stadium and instead sat outside on benches and picnic blankets, watching mass on electronic devices or listening to the faint noise from inside the arena. Genevieve Kamali, a 53-year-old Fijian, missed out on tickets and huddled outside with eight family members. But she was not too disappointed. \"The Holy Father is just a few meters away,\" she told AFP. \"Faith is about not seeing but believing.\"      ",

        "text": "News News | Aug 7, 2023  A basic tenant of any just society is that a day\u2019s labor should provide enough to live on. The minimum wage must be a living wage \u2013 a wage to live here.\u00a0 What does it cost to live here? A room in a shared house today easily runs upwards of $1,200/month. Federal and state taxes for a full-time minimum wage worker runs about $400/month. Utilities, groceries, car payments and gas easily add another $800/month. A basic Covered California subsidized health insurance plan adds another $80/month (a full-time worker won\u2019t qualify for MediCal).\u00a0\u00a0 At the current $15.50 minimum wage, a full-time employee, here, is left with about $3 a day. That\u2019s not a living wage. A single car repair, medical bill, or a rent hike, and there\u2019s nothing left.\u00a0 The results are seen in widespread help-wanted signs, as our workforce, depleting their savings to live here, packs up and leaves. And with the City Council\u2019s recent 3-2 rejection of a vacancy tax to incentivize empty second houses to sell or rent, nothing is on the horizon that could substantially lower rents, the primary driver of our cost of living. If our goal is become like Vail or Aspen or Incline Village, an exclusive Disney-like enclave for wealthy, seasonal vacation houses served by transient workers unable to put down roots in their community, this is success. If our goal is a vibrant, thriving, and year-round community, the path we are on is unsustainable.\u00a0 Both the federal and state government define housing as affordable if it consumes less than a third of one\u2019s income. In the above example, that works out to $23/hr. But more than the absolute amount, that minimum wage needs to be tied to automatically adjust with the primary cost of living, rent \u2013 so when rent goes up, so does the minimum wage.\u00a0\u00a0 That is what I propose: A $23/hr minimum wage, phased in over five years, and then tied to the median cost of rent. Just enough pay so that a single room, in a shared house, is affordable to a full-time worker.\u00a0\u00a0 None of this is radical. In the last five years, the state of California raised the minimum wage from $11 to $15.50/hr, an increase of over 40%. Many cities in California, including San Francisco, and Emeryville have minimum wages that are already significantly higher than the state minimum, and 12 states plus the D.C. automatically tie minimum wage increases to the cost of living.\u00a0\u00a0 According to the Tahoe tourism industry\u2019s own economic data in their recently published \u201cDestination Management Plan\u201d (Appendix B), tourism industry profits are up by 28% \u2013 over half a billion dollars \u2013 in the last 5 years. While over that same time, average tourism industry worker pay has actually decreased both in raw dollars, and, accounting for inflation, by a staggering 15%. For perspective, again accounting for inflation, if the five-year increase in tourism industry profits had gone to workers, that would represent an average annual pay increase of $2,880/year \u2013 over two months-worth of rent.\u00a0\u00a0 The current state minimum wage is so far below our skyrocketing cost of living, that even Vail Resorts, a mega-corporation with no great record of supporting labor rights, now pays a minimum starting wage of $20/hr so employees can have even a shot at living here.\u00a0\u00a0 Tahoe\u2019s tourism economy needs to start working for locals \u2013 and raising the minimum wage is one part of making this happen.\u00a0 Many have argued that local workers should not expect to live here at all, that low wage workers should live in Minden or Carson City (places which themselves are rapidly becoming unaffordable) and instead commute to Tahoe. This is classism of the highest order \u2013 a statement that Tahoe belongs to the rich, and that the \u201cpoors\u201d who serve us, aren\u2019t worthy to be our neighbors. Ethics aside, at a practical level, it\u2019s a strategy that would see tremendously increased amounts of commuter traffic and long-term costs to our environment.\u00a0\u00a0 Many have decried that raising the minimum wage will kill jobs, with workers replaced with AI or jobs shipped overseas. This despite both the increase in profits and current epidemic of help-wanted signs throughout our tourism industry, following the 40% minimum wage increases of the last five years. Neither AI nor outsourcing can clean hotel rooms, bus tables, teach swim lessons, or assist special-needs schoolchildren.\u00a0 The South Tahoe Chamber of Commerce recently made the perverse argument that we shouldn\u2019t pay a living wage at all, because if we did, workers might no longer quality for welfare and food stamps, and children might not be poor enough to need free lunches. As if this was a bad thing. This is \u201cWalmart reasoning\u201d \u2013 the idea that taxpayers should subsidize exploitation of labor in a race to the bottom. It cannot go without note, that these same special interest lobbies who opposed every action on affordable housing that could have lowered the costs of living here, now oppose raising wages to make living here possible \u2013 squeezing our workforce from both ends.\u00a0 Ultimately though, the City Council represents the people who live here, and it is in their interests, not special interest lobbies, that the city should act. We have the authority to raise the minimum wage and give the workers in our community a fair shot at living here. The voters, in turn, must hold their representatives to accountable for their choices.\u00a0 Change is needed. The end of the road we are currently on is a community without soul, without spirit, and without locals \u2013 and it is the locals who make Tahoe a home.\u00a0 \nOct 18, 2024\n  \nOct 16, 2024\n \nOct 16, 2024\n \nOct 15, 2024\n \nJun 14, 2024\n Readers around the Lake Tahoe Basin and beyond make the Tahoe Tribune's work possible.

        "summary": "A living wage is essential in a just society, but the current minimum wage in California is not enough to cover the cost of living. A room in a shared house costs over $1,200/month, and with taxes, utilities, and other expenses, a full-time minimum wage worker is left with only $3/day. This is not a living wage, and a single unexpected expense can be devastating. The City Council's rejection of a vacancy tax means that rents are unlikely to decrease, making it difficult for workers to afford to live in the area. To address this, the author proposes a $23/hour minimum wage, phased in over five years, and tied to the median cost of rent. This is not a radical idea, as many cities in California already have higher minimum wages, and 12 states plus DC tie minimum wage increases to the cost of living. The tourism industry in Tahoe has seen a 28% increase in profits over the past five years, but worker pay has actually decreased by 15%. Raising the minimum wage would allow workers to afford to live in the area, rather than commuting from elsewhere, which would benefit the community and the environment. Opponents of raising the minimum wage argue that it would kill jobs, but this is not supported by evidence, and the current lack of affordable housing and living wage is unsustainable. Ultimately, the City Council has the authority to raise the minimum wage and should act in the interests of the people who live in the community."

Cancel anytime. Activists appeal for a $15 minimum wage near the Capitol on Feb. 25, 2021, in Washington. Raising the minimum wage is one of the most popular ways to fight poverty. It\u2019s also one of the worst. Even in conservative states like Missouri, the concept of raising the minimum wage is very popular. Missourians have passed ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage in 2006 and 2018, each by substantial margins. They\u2019ll have the chance to do it again this November, with a ballot measure that would raise the minimum wage from $12.30 to $13.75 next year and raise it to $15 in 2026. In theory, these reforms sound great. Hard-working employees get more money \u2014 an urgent need as the cost of living has risen over the past few years. The problem here isn\u2019t with the intent, but with the practical consequences. Raising the minimum wage will cost companies more money, and that money has to come from somewhere. When the government forcibly increases the cost of labor, companies can\u2019t simply absorb it, so they respond by reducing employees\u2019 hours and benefits, converting full-time staff to part-time, or laying off workers altogether. Raising the minimum wage would thus increase poverty, not reduce it. The disemployment effects of the minimum wage are well-documented. In their 2022 systematic review of minimum wage research, economists David Neumark and Peter Shirley concluded that evidence from minimum wage studies conducted over the previous three decades \u201cpoints strongly toward negative effects of minimum wages on employment of less-skilled workers.\u201d Last year, in a written testimony to the Missouri secretary of state, Elias Tsapelas of the Show-Me Institute estimated that a minimum wage hike could cost as many as 12,000 jobs immediately. Some companies that employ minimum wage workers would certainly cut jobs, though not all of them. Restaurants need a certain number of cooks to prepare food, and stores need folks to stock shelves, so laying off workers isn\u2019t an option if these businesses want to continue operating efficiently. Instead, as recent research has shown, businesses offset minimum wage increases by hiring more part-time workers, while reducing their total hours so that they won\u2019t be eligible for costly benefits. In 2021, a group of Business Management researchers looked at how companies responded to minimum wage hikes in California over the course of three years. They found that \u201cfor every $1 increase in minimum wage, the percentage of workers working more than 20 hours per week (making them eligible for retirement benefits) decreased by 23.0%, while the percentage of workers with more than 30 hours per week (making them eligible for health care benefits) decreased by 14.9%.\u201d The same study also revealed that, because companies reduced hours for individual employees, \u201ctotal wage compensation of an average minimum wage worker in a California store actually fell by 13.6%.\u201d It\u2019s no wonder that most economists warn voters against raising the minimum wage. A 2022 survey conducted by the Institute of Labor Economics found that, of the 160 economists who responded, 71% agreed that it would lead to job losses in the hospitality industry. 39% of the economists surveyed said that a $15 minimum wage would increase poverty. Nonetheless, many self-proclaimed \u201cpro-labor\u201d activists seem to believe that the only way to get companies to pay their employees more is if the government forces them to. Commenting on a fast food workers strike in St. Louis, the editor of the Labor Tribune writes that prices for everything have been going up for more than a decade, except for the price of workers\u2019 labor. This is false on two counts: not only did the minimum wage increase in 2018, wages for fast food workers have actually gone up even further. According to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, the average fast food cook made $9.05 an hour in 2014. By 2023, cooks earned an average of $13.86 an hour \u2014 a nearly 35% increase (19% after adjusting for inflation). Workers in other traditionally low-wage occupations also saw their incomes rise. Inflation-adjusted hourly wages for retail cashiers, for example, went up by 15% over the same period. In a mostly free and dynamic economy, wages tend to go up over time. But when voters or politicians try to interfere and speed up this process by mandating even higher hourly wages, it is workers who end up paying the price.

        "text": "ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT It\u2019s been 15 years since workers earning the federal minimum wage got a raise. The cost of living has gone up more than 45% since then, with rents and home prices rising faster than incomes in most regions of the country. Yet the nation\u2019s wage floor has stayed stuck at $7.25 an hour. That is poverty pay, and an increase to the federal minimum wage is long overdue. It\u2019s mind-boggling that Congress has gone so long without making even modest adjustments to help the lowest-paid workers. This is the longest stretch of time without an increase to the federal minimum wage since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, which established the right to a minimum wage. ADVERTISEMENT Certainly there have been some attempts to lift the wage floor. Most recently, Democrats floated the Raise the Wage Act of 2023 that would have gradually increased minimum pay to $17 by 2028. Republicans countered with $11 phased in over four years. Neither proposal has moved forward. As part of her economic plan, Vice President Kamala Harris has called on Congress to send her a bill raising the minimum wage. She supported $15 an hour during the 2020 election, but hasn\u2019t named a number this time. Former President Donald Trump, not surprisingly, has sent conflicting messages on raising the minimum wage over the years. In 2016, he said he wanted to raise the federal rate to at least $10, but later said minimum wage hikes should be left to the states, which is effectively what\u2019s happening now. Some 30 states and the District of Columbia have enacted higher wage floors, and many cities \u2014 including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York \u2014 have adopted higher base pay than their states in recognition that it is more expensive to live in urban areas. In Seattle and some surrounding cities, the minimum wage is almost $20 an hour. Still, 20 states, bowing to politics and business lobbying, have kept the federal $7.25 an hour as their pay floor. That\u2019s why Congress needs to act, and the next president should commit to signing a wage hike. The minimum wage is supposed to ensure workers can afford basic necessities. It\u2019s hard to imagine, even in less-expensive regions, how an adult can pay for housing, food, health care, and transportation on a full-time minimum wage salary of $15,000 a year. That is below the poverty line for a single parent with one child. When working people earn so little that they could qualify for Medicaid and food stamps, taxpayers end up subsidizing their employers. If the federal minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would be close to $11 an hour now. An estimated 5 million workers earn less than $11 an hour. And let\u2019s not kid ourselves: While earning $11 an hour working full time would lift a single parent out of poverty, it\u2019s probably not enough to pay the bills and save for a rainy day. ADVERTISEMENT There will always be debate over the correct level at which to set the minimum wage to help the most workers with the fewest negative consequences, which could include businesses cutting low-wage jobs to save money. Yet it should be clear that $7.25 is now woefully low and no longer a fair wage floor. Everyone benefits when working people earn a decent living, and raising the federal minimum wage is essential. \u2014 Los Angeles Times Editorial Board (latimes.com) WHAT ABOUT MINNESOTA? The minimum-wage situation in Minnesota is a bit brighter than federally. In Minnesota, the minimum wage is set to increase in January to $11.13 an hour for all employees, as the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry\n    \n      announced\n    \n       two weeks ago. The minimum wage now is $10.85 an hour for large employers and $8.85 for small employers, workers in training, and those younger than 18. The 2024 Minnesota Legislature voted to eliminate those reduced minimum-wage categories. \u2014 News Tribune Opinion page  ADVERTISEMENT",

        "text": "While organized labor across Nigeria is currently jubilant over their recent win in obtaining a minimum wage increase by fiat, every student of praxeology in Nigeria receives this news with mixed feelings and the utmost reservation, because we are cognizant of the outcomes which inevitably follow from such interventions in the free market. Earlier in May 2024, organized labor (in both public and private sector)\u2014under the auspices of the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), after putting together some numbers they considered personal living expenses of the Nigerian worker\u2014embarked on a series of nationwide strikes and public agitations in a bid to get a minimum wage increase from the previous N33,000 to N615,000. Mr. Joe Ajero, the President of the NLC, in his statement as quoted by the Premium Times, is seen making the threat that, \u201cif, however, the negotiation of the minimum wage is not concluded by the end of May, the Trade Union movement in Nigeria will no longer guarantee industrial peace in the country.\u201d This, once more, provided evidence that use of threat and violence are inherent in labor unionism. Following these developments, a series of wage negotiations were initiated, with concessions made on both sides (i.e., the workers and the government). The Nigerian government finally acquiesced to the pressures exerted by the trades union, and organized labor was able to exit negotiations with an estimated 133% increase in minimum wage\u2014to N70,000 per month. That a higher wage is preferable to a lower wage is not disputed. What concerns the student of praxeology is the rigorous investigation of the means chosen to attain these higher wages. The praxeologist always asks whether the means adopted to attain desired ends\u2014in this case, higher wages for Nigerian workers\u2014bring about the attainment of those ends. At the same time, the student of praxeology also considers economics\u2014the most elaborated subdivision of praxeology\u2014a universally-valid science of human action, and therefore, the application of its theories not to be delimited by geography or historical context. As long as man must act to remove uneasiness, economic theory holds, always and everywhere, that there is human action, including Nigeria. The purpose of this article is to show the predictions of Austrian economic theory concerning the necessary outcomes of minimum wage increases by violent intervention in general, as well its implications for the Nigerian workers. Austrian economic theory has always shown that violent intervention in the free market always produces outcomes which are judged unsatisfactory, even from the point of view of the initiators of these interventions. It asserts that intervention in the free market via minimum wage laws, or coercive actions of the trade union, would lead to the unemployment of a section of a country\u2019s labor force who are willing to sell their labor (all other things being equal). Murray Rothbard in his classic Man, Economy, and State, writes, Compulsory unemployment is achieved indirectly through minimum wage laws. On the free market, everyone\u2019s wage tends to be set at his discounted marginal value productivity. A minimum wage law means that those whose DMVP is below the legal minimum are prevented from working. The worker was willing to take the job, and the employer to hire him. But the decree of the State prevents this hiring from taking place. (italics in original) And Mises, in his book Interventionism, puts it that, \u201cto deny that raising wages above the point prescribed by market conditions must necessarily lead to a reduction in the number of employed workers is tantamount to asserting that the size of the labor supply has no influence on wage rates.\u201d A historical investigation of the effects of minimum wage laws in any country inevitably reveals that minimum wage laws always result (all other things being equal) in unemployment of a section of the workers willing to sell their labor, thus further confirming the conclusions of economic theory on wage interventions. That understood, we return to the objectives of the Nigerian government and the NLC in imposing a minimum wage increase by statutory law in order to see whether the chosen means\u2014intervention\u2014proves effective towards attaining that end. The objective of the Nigerian government and NLC is to increase the overall wage of the Nigerian worker, however, given their adoption of coercive intervention in attaining that end, the more unsatisfactory outcome of unemployment of a section of the country\u2019s skilled labor force must follow. In addition to the unsatisfactory outcome of unemployment, the wages of unskilled labor will also decrease because of the entry of these unemployed masses of skilled workers into the unskilled labor market. From this, we can say that the current win by the NLC in obtaining a minimum wage increase by statutory law, rather than market methods, is only a pyrrhic victory. How then could wages be increased for every Nigerian worker, without incurring some hidden, long-term consequences that would disrupt maximal satisfaction of most urgent wants of any group of Nigerian workers? The solution is an increase in the per head accumulation of capital. Economics recognizes that increases in per head capital accumulation would lead to higher marginal productivity of labor. When labor has access to better tools and machines, its contribution to the marginal product increases. This is the only way to increase wages for every Nigerian worker without disrupting the free market and without making any section of the population worse off in the long run. A return to the Misesian concept of \u201crightly understood\u201d long-run interest, as expounded by Mises in his short book, The Clash of Group Interests, would work to the advantage of every Nigerian worker. The Nigerian worker ought to see that it is in his best long-run interest that mere short-run gains that compromise social cooperation are renounced. Mises succinctly summarizes this point, The sacrifice that a man or a group makes in renouncing some short-run gains, lest they endanger the peaceful operation of the apparatus of social cooperation, is merely temporary. It amounts to an abandonment of a small immediate profit for the sake of incomparably greater advantages in the long run.

Updated: October 20, 2024 @ 8:34 am  Rachel Greszler WASHINGTON (TNS) \u2014 My foray into the workforce was a minimum-wage job making pizzas and washing dishes at Pizza Hut. The money I earned supported my spending as a new driver and taught me how to budget and save for the future. And the experience I gained \u2014 everything from teamwork to customer service to safety standards \u2014 has carried with me throughout my career. If I were growing up in California today, that same job opportunity probably wouldn\u2019t exist. As a 16-year-old without experience, I couldn\u2019t produce $20 per hour of value for Pizza Hut \u2014 or probably any company. But $20 per hour is where Assembly Bill 1228 in California sets the bar for fast-food workers. After factoring in mandatory employment taxes, that comes out to more than $48,000 per year for a full-time employee. Not surprisingly, multiple Pizza Hut franchises announced they are laying off 1,200 delivery drivers. These drivers are likely just the first of potentially thousands more fast-food workers who will lose their jobs. Like me, most Americans start out earning the minimum wage. And like me, most Americans are not capable of producing over $48,000 in value right out of the gate. Mandating the employers pay workers more than they can produce simply raises the bar on employment, excluding those who cannot reach it yet. When lawmakers attempt to \u201chelp\u201d lower-wage workers by mandating higher minimum wages, they often end up causing more harm than good. As the late Walter Williams warned about minimum-wage laws, \u201cintentions have no effect on outcomes.\u201d The unintended negative outcomes of minimum wages increases are well documented. Multiple analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimate that large federal minimum wage increases would: cost hundreds or thousands or millions of jobs; drive up prices, interest rates, and federal deficits; reduce total family incomes; and cause hundreds of thousands of workers who lose their jobs to permanently drop out of the labor force. Individuals with low-education, disabilities, criminal records, limited English, and teens are most likely to lose their jobs. A study by the Employment Policies Institute found that the 40% increase in the minimum wage in 2009 contributed to a 15.5% decline in employment among workers with less than a high school diploma and an 8.9% decline in teen employment (which rose to 29.8%). Minimum-wage jobs aren\u2019t meant to be careers or family-supporting jobs, but they nevertheless play a crucial role as a stepping stone into more advanced and higher-paying employment. The individuals who have initial job opportunities cut off by precipitous minimum-wage hikes suffer lifelong consequences. Studies show that workers who held part-time jobs as teens have 7% higher earnings than their peers who didn\u2019t have part-time jobs. Further, individuals exposed to high minimum wages have lower future earnings, and those who suffer job losses from minimum-wage increases are more likely to be arrested for property crimes. Another consequence of minimum-wage hikes is higher prices because naturally, when employers have to pay workers more to do the same thing, they have to raise their prices. When New York City increased its minimum wage from $13 to $15, 86% of restaurants said they raised their prices, and 40% reported losing repeat customers. Fewer customers means fewer workers are needed. Even more seasoned workers who retain their jobs could be worse off despite receiving a pay raise. That\u2019s because restaurants in California could also adjust to the $20 minimum wage by cutting worker hours, eliminating benefits like health insurance and imposing on-demand scheduling. California lawmakers may think that mandating higher wages could help address issues like housing unaffordability, high crime rates, homelessness and rising costs, but the evidence shows it could have the opposite effect. That\u2019s because laws can\u2019t create higher incomes \u2014 they can only redistribute incomes. The only way workers can achieve lasting real wage gains is by becoming more productive. To that end, state policymakers should eliminate unnecessary licensing requirements so that people don\u2019t need a costly license to braid hair or arrange flowers. Federal lawmakers should end the government\u2019s monopoly on registered apprenticeships so that more people can get paid while being trained for successful careers. And all levels of government should remove unnecessary regulations so that more of businesses\u2019 estimated $12,800 per employee in annual regulatory costs could go toward higher wages and investments in workers. Such policy changes may not poll as well as a $20 minimum wage, but they\u2019ll actually help workers. And isn\u2019t that the goal?

        "summary": "The author, Rachel Greszler, recounts her first job at Pizza Hut, where she learned valuable skills and earned a minimum wage. She notes that if she were a teenager in California today, she wouldn't have that same job opportunity due to Assembly Bill 1228, which sets the minimum wage for fast-food workers at $20 per hour. This wage is equivalent to over $48,000 per year for a full-time employee, which is unrealistic for most entry-level workers. As a result, multiple Pizza Hut franchises have laid off 1,200 delivery drivers. Mandating higher minimum wages can harm workers by excluding those who cannot produce that level of value. Minimum-wage jobs are meant to be stepping stones to more advanced employment, and cutting off these opportunities can have lifelong consequences. Studies show that workers who held part-time jobs as teens have higher earnings later in life, but high minimum wages can lead to lower future earnings and even increased crime rates. Raising the minimum wage can also lead to higher prices, reduced hours, and eliminated benefits for workers. Instead of mandating higher wages, policymakers should focus on eliminating unnecessary regulations and licensing requirements to help workers become more productive and achieve real wage gains. The author argues that these policy changes may not be popular, but they would actually help workers in the long run."

SMEs He emphasized that the business sectors most affected are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as some of them are just starting out. \u201cCompanies, especially SMEs, are forced to cut jobs to maintain profitability and competitiveness,\u201d he said. He noted that the wage increase will significantly contribute to the \u201cincrease in companies\u2019 operating expenses,\u201d which will consequently be passed on to customers. Operating expenses are the costs a company incurs to keep its day-to-day operations running smoothly. These expenses are essential for a business to function and generate revenue, including payroll from salaries, wages and benefits for employees. Thus, Ynoc said this might lead to potential job losses since labor costs are a major expense in most industries. \u201cThis will affect the business sector\u2019s competitiveness as prices will go up,\u201d he explained. Meanwhile, the Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI) hopes the recent decision by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) 7 regarding wage adjustments will not burden businesses, particularly those classified as SMEs, which serve as the backbone of the regional economy. SMEs operate with limited profit margins and lack the capacity to absorb additional costs, including labor, CCCI stressed. THE RTWPB 7 approved the increase of the daily minimum wage rates of workers in private establishments in the region. In a statement, the Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) said the RTWPB set the increases in the daily minimum wage rates from P33 to P43 per day, starting on Oct. 2. The increase brings the daily minimum wages from P458-P468 to P501 for the workers in private establishments under Class A or the Cities of Carcar, Cebu, Danao, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Naga and Talisay and the municipalities of Compostela, Consolacion, Cordova, Liloan, Minglanilla and San Fernando, and from P425-P430 to P463 in other cities not classified under Class A, which include Bais, Bayawan, Bogo, Canlaon, Dumaguete, Guihulngan, Tagbilaran, Tanjay and Toledo. For Class C or the municipalities not covered under Class A and B, the daily minimum wage was increased to P453 from P415-P420.  \u201cThe new rates for workers in private establishments translate to about a seven-eight percent increase from the prevailing daily minimum wage rates in the two regions and result in a comparable 11 percent increase in wage-related benefits covering 13th month pay, service incentive leave, and social security benefits such as SSS, PhilHealth and Pag-Ibig,\u201d the Dole said. \u201cThe wage orders are expected to directly benefit a total of 1.2 million minimum wage earners in these regions and about 2.7 full-time wage and salary workers earning above the minimum wage may also indirectly benefit as a result of upward adjustments at the enterprise level arising from the correction of wage distortion,\u201d it added.

        "text": "Gus Carlson is a U.S.-based columnist for The Globe and Mail. As cautionary tales go, the minimum wage mess in California is a compelling one for lawmakers anywhere who seek to tinker with free market forces to make political hay and succeed only in hurting the very constituents they hope to benefit. The California situation is a textbook example of how not to go about things. Last September, Governor Gavin Newsom raised the minimum wage for the 500,000 workers in the state\u2019s quick-service restaurant sector by almost 25 per cent, to US$20 an hour. The law, which came into effect in April, applies to any chain with 60 or more restaurants nationwide, among them well-known names such as McDonald\u2019s, Burger King and California\u2019s own In-N-Out Burger. The domino effect of the backlash has been swift and sharp. Since the new law was announced, more than 10,000 QSR jobs in the state have been eliminated. More cuts are planned this year, including almost 1,300 drivers at chains such as Pizza Hut and Round Table Pizza. Many restaurants also raised prices, which dampened consumer demand. Few people want to pay US$20 for a hamburger meal \u2013 that is the antithesis of the fast-food concept of convenience at a wallet-friendly price point. As a result of softer sales, many locations have cut back hours for employees. So, even though workers are making a higher wage, those who survived layoffs are often logging fewer hours, and the net gain of the new law is muted. Further, and more potentially devastating to work force numbers, the wage hike has added new impetus to the sector\u2019s push to automation. New technology companies such as Navia Robotics and Nuwa Robotics have emerged in the artificial intelligence and robotics space to develop systems that will accelerate the evolution of fast-food restaurants to automation and away from human staff. That doesn\u2019t bode well for people. As automation becomes the rule not the exception, the prospect of more job losses is very real. To be sure, the concept of a minimum wage has merit in its intent to protect low-paid workers by providing an enforceable baseline value for their labour. The problem comes when legislation such as California\u2019s is applied selectively and punitively to drive a political agenda. While politics are certainly at play in the California scenario \u2013 Mr. Newsom, a progressive Democrat, has a notoriously anti-business agenda \u2013 it is a two-way street. Lawmakers on the other side of the ideological aisle who seek to depress minimum wages unfairly are equally culpable. Georgia and Wyoming, for example, both have Republican governors and state minimum wage rates below the federal rate. Like anything, the minimum wage equation is about balance. That\u2019s why it is so challenging for legislators around the world to settle on appropriate rates. Most industrialized countries have minimum wage structures \u2013 some are broad and all-encompassing; others are tiered across local, state, provincial and federal levels to reflect the economic differences and disparities of a national landscape. In the United States, for example, the federal minimum wage is US$7.25 an hour. Currently, 34 states, territories and districts have their own rates, as well. In states that have minimum wage rates in addition to the federal rate, employees are entitled to the higher of the two. By comparison, Ottawa raised Canada\u2019s federal minimum wage to $17.30 on April 1. Provinces and territories also set minimum wages as part of their labour laws. Done properly and fairly, despite predictable ideological grumbling on both sides, a minimum wage can be a valuable element of a healthy economy. Done poorly and unfairly, it can result in something like California\u2019s predicament \u2013 massive job losses and higher prices driving consumer unhappiness, resulting in fewer hours for those workers who remain and an acceleration of the shift to automation that will prompt further job losses. While perhaps politically expedient for its advocates, the new California law has quickly become an economic lose-lose-lose scenario for workers, consumers and employers. Regardless of your political stand, the point is clear. Lawmakers of any stripe who seek to manipulate free markets without understanding the balance required to keep economic engines chugging along should beware. Minimum wages have their place in the economic mix, but like any component in the bigger machine, if they get out of whack in terms of size and influence, things will go wrong until balance is restored. It is unclear if California has the political will to recover from its misstep in the QSR sector. Still, lawmakers everywhere struggling with minimum wage calculations should watch the Golden State carefully and understand the consequences, intended and unintended, of actions that threaten the balance of a free market. The ultimate litmus test lies in whether any action will do no harm and actually help people it is intended to benefit. California got the answer wrong. But at least it may be a learning moment for anyone else wrestling with this issue.

        "text": "Sep 13, 2024 It\u2019s been 15 years since workers earning the federal minimum wage got a raise. The cost of living has gone up more than 45% since then, with rents and home prices rising faster than incomes in most regions of the country. Yet the nation\u2019s wage floor has stayed stuck at $7.25 an hour. That is poverty pay, and an increase to the federal minimum wage is long overdue. It\u2019s mind-boggling that Congress has gone so long without making even modest adjustments to help the lowest-paid workers. This is the longest stretch of time without an increase to the federal minimum wage since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, which established the right to a minimum wage. Certainly there have been some attempts to lift the wage floor. Most recently Democrats floated the Raise the Wage Act of 2023 that would have gradually increased minimum pay to $17 by 2028. Republicans countered with $11 phased in over four years. Neither proposal has moved forward. As part of her economic plan, Vice President Kamala Harris has called on Congress to send her a bill raising the minimum wage. She supported $15 an hour during the 2020 election, but hasn\u2019t named a number this time. Donald Trump, not surprisingly, has sent conflicting messages on raising the minimum wage over the years. In 2016, he said he wanted to raise the federal rate to at least $10, but later said minimum wage hikes should be left to the states, which is effectively what\u2019s happening now. Some 30 states and the District of Columbia have enacted higher wage floors, and many cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City, have adopted higher base pay than their states in recognition that it is more expensive to live in urban areas. In Seattle and some surrounding cities, the minimum wage is almost $20 an hour. Still, 20 states, bowing to politics and business lobbying, have kept the federal $7.25 an hour as their pay floor. That\u2019s why Congress needs to act, and the next president should commit to signing a wage hike. The minimum wage is supposed to ensure workers can afford the basic necessities. It\u2019s hard to imagine, even in less expensive regions, how an adult can pay for housing, food, healthcare and transportation on a full-time minimum wage salary of $15,000 a year. That is below the poverty line for a single parent with one child. When working people earn so little that they could qualify for Medicaid and food stamps, taxpayers end up subsidizing their employers. If the federal minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would be close to $11 an hour now. An estimated 5 million workers earn less than $11 an hour. And let\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2014 while earning $11 an hour working full time would lift a single parent out of poverty, it\u2019s probably not enough to pay the bills and save for a rainy day. There will always be debate over the correct level at which to set the minimum wage to help the most workers with the fewest negative consequences, which could include businesses cutting low-wage jobs to save money. Yet it should be clear that $7.25 is now woefully low and no longer a fair wage floor. Everyone benefits when working people earn a decent living, and raising the federal minimum wage is essential. \u2014 Los Angeles Times Dubbed the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States since Maria in 2017, Helene has already claimed more than ...

        "text": " Workers take down a wind turbine tower for repair at the KMC Sportsman Lodge in Gurnsey County,... [+] Ohio, 2012. Photographer: Ty Wright/Bloomberg  I'm a firm believer that we must support ALL energy sources because\u00a0each\u00a0of them\u00a0will have a key role to play in the years ahead. Unfortunately, I've also come to notice that those in the renewable energy\u00a0business are much more anti- coal, oil, and natural gas than the latter group is against the former,\u00a0creating an \"us\" versus \"them\" mentality that ignores the fact that\u00a0ALL energy sources have pros and cons. So, a reality check is in order, especially since there's a growing and dangerous push to 1) NOT produce more fossil fuels, 2) NOT build more related infrastructure, and/or 3) hurt the companies that produce our coal, oil, and gas. As New England is finding out, where a lack of pipelines to access lower cost Pennsylvania shale just means more costly gas imports from Yemen (here),\u00a0all the anti- coal, oil, and gas push does is\u00a0help foreign suppliers because our demand isn't going away.  The movement against more coal, oil, and gas use faces a number of problems and unintended consequences that don't go so easily ignored in the real world as hoped. 1. The goal to lower coal, oil, and gas use faces a fundamental economics problem:\u00a0less fossil fuel usage lower their prices, thereby increasing the attractiveness of using coal, oil, and gas. For example, sunken\u00a0gasoline prices are hurting electric vehicle sales. 2. Significantly less coal, oil, and gas use will create huge\u00a0job losses, hurting families and communities, creating even greater resentment across the country.\u00a0Federal and state funding to alleviate these losses are extra costs that will be measured in the\u00a0billions of dollars. To illustrate, never mentioned is the Native Americans losing their once steady and high-paying coal jobs because of continuous regulations, devastating tribes that often have over 60% unemployment. \"There are 10 million direct and indirect oil industry jobs in America,\" and highly skilled engineers can easily have annual salaries over $130,000. Globally, some of the world's poorest nations are very resource rich and\u00a0rely on oil and gas sales for over 70% of GDP, crucial revenue streams that the anti-fossil fuel movement never considers. No solutions are ever given for these problems. In fact, the U.S. solar business\u00a0has actually been touting\u00a0the \"there's most solar jobs than coal jobs\" argument even though solar supplies less than 1% of U.S. electricity, and coal supplies over 30%.\u00a0And the solar business has also touted that it has more jobs than oil and gas....ignoring the fact that oil and gas are 65% of our energy, and solar provides 0%! In other words, the solar business is promoting the fact that it produces less energy with more workers. Indeed, economic majors we are not.\u00a0Econ 101: jobs are a cost in the process of production; the services a job provides are the benefits. Using more workers to accomplish less is a sign of INEFFICIENCY, and obviously not something to boast about. As for the undefined \"green job,\" my question remains unanswered: \"does the coal miner that mines the coal that makes the steel that makes the windmill have a green job?\" Certainly more so than the lawyers and administration assistants that inexplicably get counted in our \"green job\" tallies. 3. Less coal, oil, gas use will crush tax incomes for states and erode critical budgets (here), already\u00a0stuck in challenging times since The Great Recession.\u00a0In Wyoming, coal alone\u00a0supplies $1.2 billion in taxes per year. In California, the state faces budget shortages because: \u00a0\"As motorists use less and less gas, gas tax revenues to pay for state highways, roads and bridges shrink.\"\u00a0Our largest oil and gas company, ExxonMobil, pays\u00a0$85 million in corporate taxes...per day! 4. Although seeming like the ultimate \"no-brainers,\" even more policies for efficiency and conservation create unintended problems.\u00a0Consider California's\u00a0drought and encouragement for people to use less water:\u00a0 \"Water departments are increasing rates and adding fees because they're losing money as their customers conserve.\" Fixed costs like repairing pipelines, customer service, and enforcing water restrictions continue to increase, and lost revenue from conservation must somehow be made up, frequently with higher rates.\u00a0\"Residents in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, are seeing higher bills after the region's largest water wholesaler increased the price of water 28 percent to make up for lagging sales.\" 5. Indeed, hardly a panacea,\u00a0more efficiency can actually mean MORE energy use because it lowers fuel costs. For example,\u00a0\"buy\u00a0a more fuel-efficient car, drive more.\" Efficiency leads to\u00a0economic growth for both the overall economy and the individual, causing total energy consumption to increase (\u201cthe rebound effect\u201d). Conveniently ignored, we've known this \"Jevons Paradox\" of energy efficiency increasing demand\u00a0since 1865 (here). 6. California illustrates how even tens of billions spent on more wind and solar ultimately means more natural gas because gas is the more reliable backup for their intermittency. Again, this cannot be overstated: the majority of the time\u00a0wind and solar power are UNAVAILABLE.\u00a0Natural gas now produces 61% of California's electricity, up from\u00a047% in 2003 when the state implemented it's first Renewable Portfolio Standard. This explains why wind and solar are in reality more \"supplemental\" than \"alternative,\" and why I'd argue that\u00a0more R&D to lower the cost of renewables and create a way to store electricity at large-scale are far more important than building wind and solar farms (\"Obama-Backed Solar Plant Could Be Shut Down For Not Producing Enough Energy\"). Never mentioned is the fact that Europe's wind power capitals of Germany and Denmark have home electricity rates of 40 and 42 cents per kWh respectively, compared to just 12.7 cents in the U.S. 7. Fossil\u00a0fuel inputs are enormous, no matter which direction our energy system goes. Our entire complex is\u00a0built on fossil fuels, so more wind and solar inevitably mean more coal, oil, and gas use. For example,\u00a0diesel oil trucks are what move windmills and solar panels, and there's about 150 tonnes of metallurgical coal via steel in an onshore windmill - and 250 tonnes of coal in an offshore one. Still the best read here on the conveniently forgotten headwinds that non- coal, oil, and gas energy sources face in a world built on coal, oil, and gas, ultimately it's evolving fossil fuel technologies that will reduce emissions most, not more wind and solar. 8. A global perspective is always required.\u00a0With 6 in every 7 humans still living in undeveloped nations, the world has JUST STARTED to consume energy. The developing world has made it understandably very clear:\u00a0poverty reduction is a first and overriding priority. There are 2,100 coal plants planned around the world.\u00a0 The reality is that we will continue to see\u00a0all energy sources, all of the time. Energy, after all,\u00a0is the driving force of economic development and economic development is the\u00a0driving force of longer, healthier lives.\u00a0Got an energy project to install? The\u00a0answer is \"yes.\" 9. Contrary to what you're being told, renewables are not \"new,\" and in fact wind and solar were some of the first sources of energy (here, here). But, the world moved on, and in the 1800s coal, oil, and gas took the reins.\u00a0The world moves forward, not backward, explaining why\u00a0the next energy system is likely to be\u00a0something completely new, like fusion, fission, hydrogen, or something else we've never seen before. 10. Scale and Irreplaceability. Too many\u00a0Americans seem unable to grasp the sheer scale of our energy system, a monstrosity that devours 100,000 tons of coal, 35 million gallons of oil, and 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas...every hour. As sources of electricity, wind and solar don't even compete in 60% of our energy system. Mr. Musk's shaken dreams (\"fueled by $4.9 billion in government subsidies!\"\u00a0mind you)\u00a0provide a prime example of just how dominant more reliable and more affordable fossil fuels are.\u00a0The U.S. is now back selling over 17 million oil-based vehicles per year, and less than 150,000 of them run on electricity.\u00a0And don't forget: in any event, nearly 70% of our electricity comes from coal, oil, and natural gas. ",
        "summary": "The author believes that all energy sources, including fossil fuels and renewables, will play a key role in the future. However, the anti-coal, oil, and gas movement is creating an \"us\" versus \"them\" mentality that ignores the pros and cons of each energy source. The movement faces several problems, including the fact that lower fossil fuel usage leads to lower prices, making them more attractive. Significantly reducing fossil fuel usage will also lead to huge job losses and economic costs. The author argues that the solar industry is touting misleading job numbers and ignoring the fact that oil and gas provide 65% of the US's energy. Less fossil fuel usage will also crush tax incomes for states and erode critical budgets. Efficiency and conservation policies can also create unintended problems, such as higher rates for consumers. More efficiency can actually lead to more energy use, known as the \"rebound effect\". The author concludes that fossil fuel inputs are enormous and will continue to play a role in the energy system, and that a global perspective is necessary to understand the driving force of economic development. Ultimately, the next energy system will likely be something completely new, like fusion or hydrogen."

(Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images) The world added 473 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity last year, according to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, and four-fifths of it produces power more cheaply than fossil fuels do. The added capacity, roughly equivalent to 473 nuclear plants, produces electricity at prices most fossil plants can\u2019t match and that the nuclear industry can only dream of: The global average cost of electricity from onshore wind fell to 3.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, 3 percent less than the year before, and utility-scale solar photovoltaic fell to 4.4 cents/kWh, 12% less than the year before. Fossil-fuel prices rose in 2023 to 10 cents/kWh, according to IRENA\u2019s report, which largely ignores nuclear power (new nuclear has been estimated to cost as much as 25-30 cents/kWh). \u201cThe world is embracing the transition away from fossil fuels,\u201d IRENA Director General Francesco La Camera writes, aided by the continuing decline in technology costs. \u201cThe rising competitiveness of renewables in comparison to fossil fuels is driving extensive deployment of (renewables),\u201d the report states. The period from 2010 to 2023 saw a \u201cseismic shift\u201d away from fossil and nuclear in favor of renewables, it says, a trend expected to continue as countries strive to fulfill the pledge, agreed at COP28, to triple renewable-energy capacity by 2030. \u201cIn the next few years of this decade, an extensive deployment of renewable power generation in more countries and regions is therefore expected. As the electricity system evolves, innovative technologies are also being introduced to facilitate the transition from a fossil fuel-based system to a renewable one.\u201d For renewables to compete with fossil fuels and nuclear, storage is vital to provide power during renewable downtimes. \u201cWith a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage will play a crucial role in ensuring the successful delivery of electricity during supply-demand shortfalls,\u201d the report states, updating battery-storage costs and capacity with good news as well. \u2022 Battery storage has grown from 0.1 GWh gross capacity added in 2010 to 95.9 GWh gross capacity added in 2023. \u2022 From 2010 and 2023, the costs of battery storage projects declined 89% thanks to improved materials efficiency, improved manufacturing processes and economies of scale. \u2022 China is leading the world in new additions of battery storage, with 46.5 GWh of new capacity installed in 2023, accounting for nearly half of global additions. \u201cChina represented the largest market for solar PV (63%), onshore wind (66%), offshore wind (65%) and hydropower (44%) in 2023,\u201d the report states, \u201cdue to the country\u2019s substantial renewable additions in 2023, which drove the decline in the global weighted average costs for these technologies.\u201d China lays claim to some of the largest solar development projects, including the still-developing Tengger Desert New Energy Base, which reportedly has already delivered more than 2 billion kWh of electricity to neighboring provinces. IRENA estimates that power companies and their customers saved $409 billion in fuel costs from 2000 to 2023 thanks to renewables.  One Community.

        "text": "Modern civilization depends on abundant, affordable, and reliable energy. Policies that ignore this won\u2019t turn out well. Starting this month, everyday citizens, not just hedge fund managers and traders, will be able to make direct bets on \u201cbig\u201d issues ranging from basic economic indicators to the weather. Based in Greenwich, Connecticut, the global trading firm Interactive Brokers has won U.S. federal approval to run\u00a0a \u201cprediction market\u201d platform allowing users to make bets on everything from consumer sentiment to the national debt to \u201catmospheric carbon dioxide.\u201d As the Wall Street Journal reported, \u201cInteractive Brokers said it believes that it \u2018can help establish a collective view\u2019 on \u2018controversial issues.\u2019\u201d Let\u2019s hope for an opportunity to bet on whether the energy transition, the linchpin of the ruling energy orthodoxy, will in fact happen. The orthodox view, of course, is that it\u2019s already underway, and the world will radically reduce, if not eliminate, the use of oil, natural gas, and coal. This narrative is firmly embedded in plans, policies, and rhetoric on both sides of the partisan divide. Conferences, studies, and consultancies are framed around the transition. Even \u201cBig Oil,\u201d from Exxon to Chevron, genuflects to the narrative. The only substantive debate about the energy transition concerns how fast it\u2019s happening and what should or shouldn\u2019t be subsidized to hasten the inevitable. Meantime, hydrocarbons still supply over 80 percent of America\u2019s and the world\u2019s primary energy needs, roughly the same proportion as two decades ago. But that fact understates reality. Hydrocarbons are used, in one way or another, in everything we build and use to sustain civilization. The goal of the energy transition is not only to eliminate the ubiquity of hydrocarbons but also to do it fast. That is the central objective of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This is a government enterprise arguably unprecedented in American history, and certainly in the history of industrial programs. A proper accounting of the IRA reveals that its real costs\u2014$2 trillion to $3 trillion\u2014will be far greater than the costs its advocates claim. For context, in inflation-adjusted terms, the U.S. spent about $4 trillion to prosecute World War II. This level of spending, complemented by similar pursuits in about two dozen states, makes the IRA one of the defining issues of our time. It is no exaggeration to say that the realities of energy systems\u2014the physics, the engineering, and the economics\u2014are now central to the future of the U.S. economy, and thus central to our policy and political debates. Society as we know it would not exist if not for vast supplies of energy. Energy is consumed by every invention, product, and service that makes life safe, interesting, convenient, enjoyable, and even beautiful. Energy policies are bets on whether there\u2019s enough energy to meet people\u2019s demands both now and in the future. But underlying that observation is a foundational truth relevant to forecasters and policymakers: throughout history, innovators have invented far more ways to consume energy than to produce it. One of humanity\u2019s remarkable capabilities is to invent future wants\u2014that is, to invent new energy demands. There was no energy demand for air conditioning before its invention. We used no energy for flying until the airplane. The same is true for the car, pharmaceuticals, and computing. The global computing ecosystem now uses more energy than global aviation, and it is growing far faster. And now comes artificial intelligence: in energy terms, AI is to computers what jet engines are to aircraft. Energy policies are thus also bets on what it is possible to build to supply those needs. Supply follows demand, but a lack of supply can also kill demand. The past and present offer ample evidence that the latent energy demands of billions of people across the globe remain underserved. An ironclad hierarchy pertains when it comes to supplying energy. Call it a triumvirate of needs. First, you need enough energy. You can\u2019t consume what you don\u2019t produce. Energy abundance is key. Energy shortfalls stifle economic growth; severe shortfalls are lethal. Second, abundant energy needs to be cheap. Affordability matters. The visible political touchstone for that reality is the price of a gallon of gasoline. More hidden is the industrial touchstone, which is the combined price of hydrocarbons and electricity. Ignoring this hidden reality has led the U.K. and Germany to sink into economically destructive deindustrialization. Third, energy needs to be reliable at all scales and timeframes. Reliability is about meeting the energy demands of people, machines, and systems not only minute-by-minute but also over days, weeks, months, and years. The absence of energy when it is needed can crash both machines and economies. Reliability is the inverse of fragility in energy supply chains. It is the sine qua non that lets low-cost abundance be taken for granted. High reliability allows the energy issue seemingly to disappear from our daily concerns, but behind the scenes it is a Sisyphean struggle. A society must always be designing and building energy supply chains to combat the realities of relentless, often malevolent, interference from nature, accidents, or human choices. It takes a complex and delicate dance to build systems that can simultaneously balance the triumvirate of needs: abundance, affordability, and reliability. The rules to that dance are dictated by the physics of energy and how it is manifested in the machinery we can build and afford. You could call it the physics of money. You may have noticed that I\u2019ve made no mention of the environment in the ironclad energy hierarchy.\u00a0Abundant, affordable, and reliable energy creates the conditions for wealth that in turn make possible the time and capital required for everything beyond mere survival\u2014 from health care to entertainment to the modern luxury of environmental protection. Break the triumvirate of needs, and we know what happens. Throughout history and across the world, we see the correlation between environmental degradation and poverty. When it comes to energy forecasts, the elephant in the room is the climate debate\u2014the ultimate motivation for energy transition goals. But it doesn\u2019t matter what one thinks about climate science when it comes to analyzing the physics and economics of the energy systems that we know how to build. They are entirely separate magisteria. Thus, it was predictable that energy pundits would rediscover the ironclad hierarchy with the rapid expansion of the most recently invented energy-using infrastructure. I\u2019m referring of course to artificial intelligence. It\u2019s a pure example of the invention of energy demands. Electric utilities around the country are now reporting epic jumps in forecasts for near-term power demand. The end of the interregnum of flat growth in electric usage comes not because of enthusiasm for electric vehicles (EVs), or because of the repatriation of semiconductor factories, though both are significant new demand vectors. It comes because the so-called virtual world of software can exist only within the physical world of energy-hungry hardware. The cloud, whether measured in terms of the size of the network, the capital deployed, or the energy used, is on track to become the biggest infrastructure ever built by humanity. Global capital spending on energy-using hardware to build the cloud and its networks now exceeds global capital spending by all electric utilities on energy-producing power plants and those networks. For context, today\u2019s global cloud already consumes ten times more electricity than all the world\u2019s EVs combined. Even if EV adoption expands at the rate that enthusiasts assume, the cloud will still significantly outpace that new demand for electricity, especially with the rush to buy AI hardware. And we are still in the early days of AI adoption. To continue the AI and jet-engine analogy, the aviation industry had been booming for three decades before the 1958 introduction of the first viable commercial passenger jet, the Boeing 707. After that transformative event, flying, measured in passenger air-miles, grew more than tenfold in under a decade and kept soaring. Of course, energy use followed. Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley pioneer and venture capital potentate, said more than a decade ago that he expected \u201csoftware would eat the world.\u201d He meant that software would disrupt \u201clarge swathes of the economy.\u201d He was right, but he may not have imagined that the hardware that makes the software possible would eat the grid. And do you think AI is the last energy-using innovation that will ever emerge? The question answers itself\u2014and that says nothing about the energy implications of billions of people who seek basic economic growth, to rise out of poverty and come to enjoy the benefits of yesterday\u2019s inventions, from air conditioning to cars to airplanes. In timeframes that matter, new demands for energy are practically unlimited. And if we employ common sense, so, too, are new supplies. To return to Andreessen: he has more recently issued a long, impassioned Techno-Optimist Manifesto which includes a specific exploration of energy. \u201cWe believe energy\u00a0should be\u00a0in an upward spiral,\u201d he observes. \u201cEnergy is the foundational engine of our civilization. The more energy we have, the more people we can have, and the better everyone\u2019s lives can be.\u201d Amen. Back to betting markets. I\u2019d take the bets\u2014and I hope Interactive Brokers will offer them\u2014that in the near future we\u2019ll see: global energy use rise, not shrink; global production and use of hydrocarbons expand, not contract, in parallel with rising alternative energy production; the abandonment of the idea of an \u201cenergy transition.\u201d These bets all derive from the iron law of the energy hierarchy. Policymakers who bet against reality will face unpleasant consequences. Mark P. Mills is a contributing editor of City Journal, executive director of the National Center on Energy Analytics, a strategic partner in the energy fund Montrose Lane, and author of The Cloud Revolution: How the Convergence of New Technologies Will Unleash the Next Economic Boom and a Roaring 2020s.

        "summary": "Modern civilization relies on abundant, affordable, and reliable energy, and policies that ignore this will not succeed. Interactive Brokers has launched a \"prediction market\" platform allowing users to bet on various issues, including energy-related topics. The energy transition, which aims to reduce or eliminate fossil fuels, is a central objective of the Inflation Reduction Act. Despite the narrative, hydrocarbons still supply over 80% of America's and the world's primary energy needs. The goal of the energy transition is to eliminate hydrocarbons quickly, but this may not be realistic. The realities of energy systems, including physics, engineering, and economics, are crucial to the future of the US economy. Energy policies are bets on whether there's enough energy to meet people's demands, and innovators have invented more ways to consume energy than to produce it. The ironclad hierarchy of energy needs includes abundance, affordability, and reliability, and breaking this hierarchy can lead to environmental degradation and poverty. The expansion of artificial intelligence is driving up energy demands, and it's predictable that energy pundits will rediscover the ironclad hierarchy. The author believes that global energy use will rise, hydrocarbon production will expand, and the idea of an \"energy transition\" will be abandoned."

I am proud to be a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which has been advocating for high safety standards, family-supporting wages, and industry-leading benefits for its members since 1891. The IBEW is working to protect members\u2019 rights and improve working conditions in the current technological and economic revolution. President Biden\u2019s clean energy plan is sparking a new generation of good-paying union jobs that are good for our communities and our planet. But like everything today, Biden\u2019s clean energy plan has been swept up in political games. Some are even arguing for repealing it, but there isn\u2019t anything controversial about creating more good jobs and giving Americans more energy choices. Thanks to the clean energy plan, businesses have already announced more than 300,000 clean energy jobs, and they expect to create millions more over the next decade. Here in North Carolina, we have seen over 4,768 clean energy jobs, and billions of dollars in new investments. The law is expected to bring more than $18.75 billion to clean power generation and energy storage in North Carolina by 2030, which means even more local jobs and opportunities for North Carolina residents. Union jobs are gaining momentum in the growing clean energy economy. The law incentivizes companies to create workforce development and apprenticeship programs that can raise workers\u2019 pay, allowing them to earn $300,000 more in wages and benefits throughout their careers. What\u2019s more, three-fourths of these new jobs won\u2019t require the cost of a four-year degree. Jobs created by the clean energy plan are not only unionized at higher rates than the overall energy workforce, they also have prevailing wage requirements that protect the gains won by Unions and help close racial and gender pay gaps. As an electrician and an IBEW member, I\u2019m proud to go to work every day to build the infrastructure for more renewable energy and a more resilient grid. Renewable energy helps lower harmful emissions that pollute our air and warm our planet. Investing in renewable energy also helps families like mine save money on our electricity bills, which also go up as summer temperatures hit. We can get tax credits and rebates by installing solar panels and switching to energy-efficient appliances. Often, the labor is done by Union workers. It\u2019s a win-win. Thanks to Biden\u2019s clean energy plan, I know jobs like mine will be around for the next generation in every corner of the country\u2014especially in communities that need good jobs and cheaper energy the most. If we keep investing in renewable energy, solar and wind power are only going to get even cheaper and more accessible. I am proud to play a part in helping America lead the world when it comes to\u00a0modernizing energy infrastructure. At the IBEW, we will continue to demand a just and pro-union future, and to fight for leaders who are working hard to support this mission. Repealing Biden\u2019s clean energy plan would let America fall behind and would pull the rug out from American workers. We need to move forward, not backward.

It\u2019s never been more important to focus efforts on a renewable energy future.\u00a0 An outspoken voice on sustainability, Dr. Roberta Boscolo from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) unpacks climate science while providing important insights on both what a climate-changed future will look like and what a renewable economic transformation could bring. Dr. Boscolo has spent her 20+ year career translating science and working closely on the water-food-energy nexus.\u00a0 Today the world is at 1.5\u00b0C; because of the El Ni\u00f1o push. We are not prepared for this, people die from heat strokes and heatwaves. Every degree increase leads to more frequent and increased storms. Sea level rise is changing coastlines. Some properties are uninsurable. We know the costs, we know the cause, and we know it\u2019s in our power to stop. Renewables are an option that can phase out fossil fuels.\u00a0 The WMO should issue better warnings that include safety measures for people. Current climate futures and risk mapping is based on the past, but what happened in the past will not be representative of the future. AI tools take far less time and computer power to do predictive models. It could be invaluable for developing nations.\u00a0 EVs, electrified transport and heating are important steps to decarbonize the economy. Batteries are more affordable. We already destroyed the world with oil and gas mining. Critical resource mining is less invasive than oil. We\u2019re not burning them, we can re-use them again and again. There will be a moment when we don\u2019t need to mine anymore, we recycle.\u00a0 We need to think about big solutions. We will use less energy in renewable systems than we use now due to efficiency and localisation of power networks. Climate change is an opportunity to create new jobs and invest in new technologies. Let\u2019s take this opportunity to innovate and be more sustainable. This is also a big opportunity for developing countries, who can form regional energy hubs to expand access. Instead of an oil economy with one nation gaining wealth, wealth will be expansive to all.\u00a0 We hope so. At this point it\u2019s going to be an overshoot, over 1.5\u00b0C. We can still get back to 1.5\u00b0C over time. It will be much more difficult now than ten years ago. We are losing time, we are losing our window of opportunity. We should drop at least 50% of emissions by 2030, and continue to net zero. Net zero means everything we emit is absorbed by nature. When China and India are able to stop and peak emissions, we will see something in the overall concentration of greenhouse gasses. Right now, renewables are covering new energy demand, but not replacing fossil fuels.\u00a0 Most important: skilled workforces that can support the energy transition across developing and developed countries. Technology is cheap and China is dominating the market. Developing countries can initially start with renewables from China, build their own economies, and then start to export energy. A faster track to transition is to provide the tools and goods needed to leapfrog to renewables. A lot of finance doesn\u2019t go to developing countries for renewables due to investment risks. Building policy frameworks and financial resources that can support this will be vital. Elections matter, climate is a problem of leadership.\u00a0 First is the issue of aerosols. They create a shield and cool the atmosphere, reflecting solar radiation while harming our health. The concentration of aerosols is getting lower in the atmosphere, helping our health but increasing warming. Second, immediately reduce methane emissions, these are 28-times more harmful than CO2 emissions. Third, tipping points; we are looking at the system in increments, but there could be elements changing completely. If Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets melt, it would increase sea level rise by ten or more meters in months. The role of the Amazon in capturing CO2 is changing. These tipping points are not well represented in WMO models, but these are big risks we need to address.   Roberta Boscolo is leading the Climate and Energy operations at the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. Her main work is to enhance the capacity of all countries to contrast climate change and enact sustainable development through scaling up science-based climate adaptation and mitigation measures in alignment with the global landmark agreements.

        "summary": "The world has just experienced 12 months at or above 1.5\u00b0C, and fossil fuels remain the main source of energy generation, responsible for 75% of emissions. Dr. Roberta Boscolo from the World Meteorological Organization emphasizes the need for a renewable energy future. The current 1.5\u00b0C mark has led to heat strokes, heatwaves, and increased storms, and sea level rise is changing coastlines.

Current climate models are based on the past, but AI tools can provide more accurate predictions. Electrified transport and heating are crucial steps to decarbonize the economy, and batteries are becoming more affordable. Critical resource mining is less invasive than oil and gas mining, and recycling can reduce the need for new mining. Climate change presents an opportunity to create new jobs and invest in sustainable technologies. To get back to 1.5\u00b0C, emissions need to drop by at least 50% by 2030 and continue to net zero.

Powered mostly by dirty fossil fuels, Michigan\u2019s big utilities would like to keep the status quo. However, an alternative energy model known as community solar has gained traction in other states like our neighbors in Ohio, Illinois and Minnesota. Community solar can provide a bridge to energy affordability and equity for low-income families, and it can play a big role in reducing energy costs.\u00a0 Community solar offers a cost-effective solution for households, local businesses, farmers, schools and others with subscriptions to community solar programs. Subscribers receive energy from the program\u2019s solar panels. Community solar opens up the benefits of solar power to people even if they rent, have old or shaded roofs or face financial barriers to the investment of installing solar panels on their property. Home energy is becoming increasingly unaffordable for low-income citizens, according to a recent report by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) and the Center for Energy Poverty, and Climate (CEPC).\u00a0 The report found the financial burden of keeping cool this summer was expected to increase by 7.9% across the nation to an average of $719 from June through September,\u00a0up from $661 during the same period last year.\u00a0 At a time when nearly\u00a03 out of 10 Americans\u00a0have trouble paying their electric bills, community solar would provide essential relief during hot summers for low-income Michigan households. It serves as a vital resource, ensuring that all communities benefit from the transition to a clean energy economy by providing access to renewable, affordable and reliable electricity. Community solar bridges the gap to energy affordability by enabling low-income households to access community solar, which lowers their energy bills, providing more disposable income for essential needs, like food, clothing and prescriptions. A recent study by the Energy Markets & Policy group with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) confirms community solar is one of the best ways to increase equity in our energy system. The study found that community solar adopters typically earn significantly lower incomes and are more likely to rent and live in multifamily buildings compared to rooftop solar adopters in most states.\u00a0 Notably, community solar subscribers are six times more likely to live in multifamily housing, four times more likely to rent, and earn 23% less than rooftop solar adopters. The greatest strength of community solar is its ability to reach populations living in multifamily and rental housing, where \"rooftop solar remains nearly inaccessible\" to these populations. While community solar presents a viable option for low-income families and other citizens, the Michigan Legislature needs to move forward and pass bipartisan community solar legislation.\u00a0 HB 4839 and 4840, which I sponsored with \u00a0Rep. Jenn Hill of Marquette, are currently pending in the Michigan House. If passed, the bills would allow Michigan to join 22 other states in enabling residents to lower energy costs for low-income households, multi-family households and renters. The legislation would enable customers to subscribe to off-site solar facilities, paying a monthly rate of electricity generated by the project in exchange for offsets on their utility bills. Beyond the previously mentioned benefits, community solar is a critical tool for helping Michigan\u2019s low income and multi-family households reduce their energy costs. Community solar subscribers would save an average of 10% on their utility bills. The legislation includes a provision that no less than 30% of the electricity produced by each solar installation be reserved for low-income households and organizations providing services for low-income residents.\u00a0 Community solar needs to be a top legislative priority this fall to remove barriers preventing low-income and multi-family households from adopting solar programs.\u00a0        Only donate if we've informed you about important Michigan issues  See what new members are saying about why they donated to Bridge Michigan:\u201cIn order for this information to be accurate and unbiased it must be underwritten by its readers, not by special interests.\u201d - Larry S.\u201cNot many other media sources report on the topics Bridge does.\u201d - Susan B.\u201cYour journalism is outstanding and rare these days.\u201d - Mark S.If you want to ensure the future of nonpartisan, nonprofit Michigan journalism, please become a member today.

        "text": "(The Center Square) \u2013 The FBI has issued an official alert to the public about the potential for malicious cyber actors to disrupt power generation, steal intellectual property, or hold critical information for ransom within the U.S. renewable energy sector.\u00a0 The warning comes as federal and local governments increasingly advocate for renewable energies, expanding the industry and creating more opportunities for cyber threats. According to the FBI, a 2019 incident underscored these risks when a private company lost visibility into approximately 500 megawatts of its wind and photovoltaic sites across California, Utah, and Wyoming due to a denial-of-service attack exploiting an unpatched firewall.\u00a0 A denial-of-service attack is a cyber assault aimed at overwhelming a network, service, or server with excessive traffic to render it unavailable to legitimate users. \u201cA cyber attack against a solar panel system\u2014residential or commercial\u2014would likely focus on targeting the system\u2019s operational technology (OT) software and hardware,\u201d the notification said. \u201cSpecifically, malicious cyber actors could attempt to gain control over a solar panel system through the inverters.\u201d Some inverters have built-in monitoring systems connected to the internet, increasing their risk, the FBI said. A malicious actor gaining control of an inverter could potentially reduce power output or cause a home\u2019s battery storage inverter to overheat. Historically, cyber attacks on residential solar infrastructure have been rare, but the growing adoption of renewable energy increases the risk. Other targets might include microgrids, local power systems that can operate independently during outages, or larger solar farms, according to the notification. The drive toward renewable energy has accelerated due to cost reductions and government incentives.\u00a0 The Inflation Reduction Act signaled a federal push for renewable energy options across U.S. municipalities. By late 2023, renewable energy accounted for about 21% of U.S. electricity generation, prompting consumers to reduce fossil fuel consumption through new tax incentives. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the largest energy consumer within the U.S. government, are increasingly sourcing energy from local electric grids. Local initiatives also reflect this trend, according to the notification. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Government aims to install 250,000 solar rooftops by 2030, according to the FBI.\u00a0 Virginia set ambitious goals for its energy production, aiming to achieve 5,500 megawatts of wind and solar energy by 2028, powering 30% of its electric system with renewable energy by 2030, and ensuring 100% of its electricity comes from carbon-free sources by 2050. In response, researchers are developing passive sensor devices to detect unusual electrical activity and counter such threat. By detecting deviations from normal patterns or unexpected fluctuations in electrical activity, these sensors can effectively identify potential cyber intrusions or unauthorized access attempts targeting the system\u2019s functionality.

Post Greg Alvarez is Energy Innovation\u2019s Deputy Director of Communications, where he executes campaigns that showcase EI\u2019s work in traditional and digital media.\n\nGreg has worked in climate and clean... During my six years in the wind industry, I often heard fear-based lies about proposed wind farms that defied common sense\u2014wind turbines would cause nails to pop out of walls, turn cows\u2019 milk sour, or decimate deer populations because bucks would catch their antlers in spinning turbine blades. On that last one, never mind wind turbine blades are a couple hundred feet off the ground. This was a nationwide phenomenon, something I heard in New York and California and half a dozen states in between like Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas. It\u2019s no surprise none of these outlandish lies ever happened once American workers built the projects and communities were reinvesting revenue from those turbines back into their schools, roads, and emergency services. In fact,\u00a0most the people I met\u00a0had overwhelmingly positive feelings about the clean energy projects in their community. Public opinion data backs up what I heard: 90% of people living in close proximity to wind turbines\u00a0prefer them\u00a0to any other kind of central power plant, and positive national attitudes about wind\u00a0improve over time\u00a0as people choose to live near existing wind turbines. There\u2019s no denying clean energy projects bring change to communities often accustomed to the status quo. But wild renewable energy rumors spread by the fossil fuel industry seem to run rampant across social media and internet forums. This disinformation is slowing the clean energy transition, imperiling efforts to fight climate change, and worsening public health. Economics don\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t site and build clean energy projects Today, wind and solar are the\u00a0cheapest forms of new electricity. Contrary to popular belief, it\u2019s cheaper to build new renewables than continue running many fossil fuel plants currently on the grid\u2014for example,\u00a099% of U.S. coal plants are uneconomic\u00a0compared to replacing them with new local solar and wind. However, the places where we can build new wind and solar projects are rapidly shrinking, according to a\u00a0new report from Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law.\u00a0Opposition to wind and solar projects such as challenges from organized groups, petitions, lawsuits, or public administrative proceeding increased 29% last year. Researchers found 395 restrictions, mostly at the city and county level, against building wind and solar projects in 2023, a\u00a073% increase since 2022. Jacob Elkin, one of the report\u2019s co-authors and a fellow for the Sabin Center\u2019s Renewable Energy Legal Defense Initiative, sees the quick rise in measures to block wind and solar as indicative of a larger shift, telling E&E News opposition to renewables has \u201cmoved beyond \u2018not in my back yard\u2019 push back.\u201d The numbers reflect impacts from all the new siting restrictions the Sabin Center identified\u2014new wind installations are at their\u00a0lowest levels\u00a0in many years.\u00a0Several factors\u00a0are behind the slowdown, including high interest rates, grid congestion, and supply chain constraints, but heightened opposition is playing a big role. When I heard all the nefarious nuisances wind projects would supposedly cause, it was never clear if the person actually believed them, if they were simply trying to justify ideological opposition, or if they didn\u2019t want to see the turbines. What is clear, however, is fossil fuel interests are helping\u00a0spread these lies: -\u00a0The Caesar Rodney Institute, a \u201cthink tank\u201d that receives substantial fossil fuel funding,\u00a0acts as the money manager\u00a0for a number of anti-offshore wind groups. - Anonymously funded\u00a0groups tied to the natural gas industry\u00a0are funding opposition to solar projects in Ohio. - Coal producer Murray Energy\u00a0has paid legal fees\u00a0for residents fighting nearby renewable energy projects. - The Marketing Resource Group, a public relations firm with decades of experience representing pipeline companies in Michigan, is\u00a0helping run a local anti-renewable energy organization\u00a0in the state. And the list goes on. Misinformation\u00a0is taking a particular toll on offshore wind growth, \u201cwhere we see the highest correlation between misinformation and opposition,\u201d\u00a0said Matthew Eisenson\u00a0of the Sabin Center. \u201cThere has been a concerted misinformation campaign to tie whale beaching\u2019s to offshore wind development and exploration.\u201d In reality, however, scientists find\u00a0ship strikes and entanglements with fishing gear\u00a0are behind the recent rise in East Coast whale deaths. Clean energy misinformation is costing us money and our health During my travels through wind country, I met dozens of people who told the\u00a0economic success stories\u00a0wind projects brought to their communities\u2014with wind project revenue covering\u00a0school budgets,\u00a0lowering local taxes, and\u00a0creating jobs\u00a0that brought young people back to home to places with otherwise rapidly aging populations. And clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are\u00a0already spurring tens of thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars in investment. A generational economic opportunity is unfolding across America, and seeing communities lose out on investment dollars and good jobs because of misinformation often pushed by fossil fuel interests is frankly heartbreaking \u2013 and the costs are huge. One study puts the price of clean energy misinformation in Michigan alone at\u00a0$210 million. \u201cIn all of these places in Michigan, there are good people who are working hard to do the best they can for their families, but they\u2019ve been led to believe things that aren\u2019t true,\u201d said Ray Locker, executive director of the\u00a0Checks and Balances Project. \u201cWe want to show the truth. The data show that wind energy helps communities by diversifying the economic base. That, in turn, helps landowners and farmers keep their properties and supports the infrastructure \u2013 schools, townships and more \u2013 around all residents.\u201d And then there\u2019s the costs our bodies and our children\u2019s bodies pay from breathing toxic air from burning fossil fuels. Misinformation may only affect a specific community where a clean energy project is proposed, but air pollution doesn\u2019t respect geographic lines. The\u00a0more we learn\u00a0about air pollution, the\u00a0worse we realize\u00a0it is\u00a0for our health. Worldwide, 2,000 children a day die from air pollution,\u00a0according to a new study from the Health Effects Institute, and air pollution is second only to malnutrition as a cause of deaths for children under five. Toxic air has also surpassed tobacco use globally to claim second place as the biggest risk factor for death, with high blood pressure presenting the worst risk. Fossil fuel power plants belch air pollution that can cause heart attacks, asthma attacks, strokes, and lost workdays. More than\u00a08 million people worldwide died in 2018 alone\u00a0from fossil fuel air pollution, and nearly one in five deaths worldwide in that year resulted from particulate matter tied to fossil fuel use. We shouldn\u2019t tolerate energy sources that cause so much suffering when cleaner, cheaper alternatives are ready to take their place. The path forward We\u2019re still learning how to\u00a0inoculate\u00a0against misinformation, but local and state governments can take several steps to stop its impact on the clean energy transition. Misinformation hotbed\u00a0Michigan again offers an illustrative example, where a\u00a0new law\u00a0charges the Michigan Public Service Commission with permitting utility-scale wind, solar and, storage projects. Alternatively, localities can adopt standards set at the state level when permitting projects. These changes can help local officials charged with clean energy zoning decisions navigate processes they may know little about, and safeguard against misinformation pushed by ill-informed constituents or covert fossil fuel interests. We know how to combat the climate crisis\u2014build as much clean energy as fast as we can and electrify all the things that currently burn fossil fuels, like cars, furnaces, and hot water heaters. For a long time, the technology wasn\u2019t mature enough or costs were too high, but we\u2019ve broken down those barriers. Now clean energy can fight climate change, invest millions in our communities, create good jobs, and help us breathe easier. We\u2019ve come so far on the engineering side only to run into a problem of the human psyche. We should never accept being made poorer and sicker because of misinformation-filled Facebook memes\u2014there\u2019s too much at stake. The politicization of energy is such a shame, given how many clear wins can come from proper energy projects: economically, environmentally, public health, positive community outcomes, and more.\u00a0 I wish I could say that disinformation with respect to renewables is limited to the US. Unfortunately, the disinformation merchants are thriving in Europe, especially for wind, both onshore and offshore.\u00a0\n\t\u00a0 Increased costs due to post-COVID supply chain caused inflation has negatively affected wind developers. \u00a0The recovery of momentum, especially for floating offshore wind, may be slow. But the longer term outlook is still positive.\n\n\tPlease continue your vital efforts to combat greenwashing and other forms of disinformation.\u00a0 As you say, the stakes are high. If wind and solar are so cheap, why the continued subsidies? There is zero chance for controlling the planets\u2019s climate by attempting to control CO2 levels. Basic mathematics and mass flow. Quite clear that green energy is being used by special interest groups to line their own pockets at the expense of the average citizen. Living in Kansas, I am not a big fan of stupefyingly huge structures cluttering the prairie, with most of the energy sent out of state. Offshore wind Is not helpful to the marine environment and that environment is extremely hard on the wind turbines. The machines off of Martha\u2019s Island are all currently shutdown as a result of one of the machines self destructing and launching blade debris all over the nearby ocean. Seems to me, wind energy is real culprit\u00a0behind hype. Wind energy can be useful, but the intermittent nature of wind has to be properly considered. The impact on the marine environment cannot be ignored. Energy from the machines needs to be reasonably priced and not propped up by the taxpayer.

Misinformation is costing communities investment dollars and good jobs, with one study estimating the cost at $210 million in Michigan alone. The author argues that local and state governments can take steps to stop the impact of misinformation on the clean energy transition. The path forward involves building as much clean energy as fast as possible and electrifying fossil fuel-based infrastructure to combat climate change."

(Reuters)  Firefighters across the nation are alarmed at the prospect of battling blazes in buildings topped with solar panels, which can create new risks of roofs collapsing, an inability to gain footing and even potential electric shock. Two recent fires involving structures decked with solar panels have triggered complaints from fire chiefs and calls for new codes and regulations that reflect the dangers posed by the clean-energy devices. A two-alarm fire last week at a home in Piedmont, Calif., prompted Piedmont Fire Chief Warren McLaren to say the technology \u201cabsolutely\u201d made it harder on firefighters. Weeks earlier, in Delanco, N.J., more than 7,000 solar panels on the roof of a massive 300,000-square foot warehouse factored into Delanco Fire Chief Ron Holt\u2019s refusal to send his firefighters onto the roof of a Dietz & Watson facility. \u201cWe may very well not be able to save buildings that have alternative energy,\u201d New Jersey\u2019s Acting Fire Marshall William Kramer told The Star-Ledger. [pullquote] Experts told FoxNews.com that the biggest danger posed by the panels is that they continue to send voltage down from the roof throughout the building even after power is shut down. In a conventional building, firefighters typically cut off the electricity leading into the house before entering. \u201cFirst of all, solar panels are designed to generate electricity any time there\u2019s light received by the panels, and that happens in low-light settings as well,\u201d said Ken Willette, a spokesman for the National Fire Protection Association. \u201cSo inherently, those are charged electrical appliances \u2026 there\u2019s a shock hazard.\u201d Solar panels also frequently utilize the very space firefighters use for rooftop ventilation during structure fires and create potentially dangerous conditions for slips and falls. \u201cIn some applications, the solar panels have covered 100 percent of the roof, which allows the firefighter no room to operate,\u201d Willette continued. \u201cThat\u2019s not what you want to have happen when you\u2019re operating on a pitched roof.\u201d With the panels rising in popularity, firefighters and building industry experts say codes must catch up. The average price of a solar panel has declined 60 percent since 2011 and industry trade groups expect that systems will be installed, on average, every four minutes in the United States by the end of 2013, primarily in California, Arizona, New Jersey and North Carolina. While the price of solar panels has dropped and their efficiency has increased, the U.S. still lags behind countries like Germany, Japan and Spain among solar panel installations. Swedish furniture giant IKEA also recently announced that it will begin selling residential solar panels at its stores in Britain, its first step to bring the renewable energy craze to the global mainstream market. A standard system will cost $9,200, including installation and an in-store consultation. John Smirnow, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, told FoxNews.com that the trade group, which represents more than 1,000 companies, is currently working with Cal Fire and the San Jose Fire Department to improve firefighter response to the systems. \u201cFirefighter safety is a top priority; we take firefighter safety very seriously,\u201d Smirnow said. \u201cThey need to know what they\u2019re dealing with. It\u2019s critically important that firefighters know the products.\u201d A 2010 report by the Fire Protection Research Foundation found that slipping or tripping on solar panels were potential hazards for firefighters, as well as the possibility of the roof collapse due to the weight of the panels, which are generally made of crystalline silicon or thin-film semiconductor material. The maximum voltage of most systems, meanwhile, is roughly 600 volts, which can cause shock or burns. \u201cThe industry has to continue to work with the fire service community, both on education and updating building codes to meet firefighters\u2019 needs,\u201d Smirnow continued. \u201cThat\u2019s really where I think we can make the most progress.\u201d Smirnow said solar panels have only factored into a \"handful\" of fires to date and added that the trade group is now in discussions with national safety groups to conduct training sessions with emergency responders across the country. \u201cWe need to understand what\u2019s best for the fire service community,\u201d he told FoxNews.com. \"What type of education do they need? Then we\u2019ll work with them to make that happen.\u201d The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

        "text": "From the end of Dina Smith\u2019s driveway, there is green as far as the eye can see. Sunlight touches the rolling hills and moorland peaks. \"Just look at it,\" she says as we take it all in. \"This is beautiful, untouched Mid Wales.\" But this could all change if plans for a huge wind turbine project get the go-ahead. For Dina, the valley is a \"really special place\", where she, her daughters and their families live and where her grandfather grew up. In the run-up to the general election, she contacted the BBC through the Your Voice, Your Vote portal with her concerns. \"I just don\u2019t want my grandchildren looking around this valley with industrial views of turbines and pylons and roads, and ask: 'What did you do about it Nanna?'\" she said. The Towy Usk project is being proposed by the renewable energy firm Green GEN Cymru and would take power from 31 giant turbines on a 60-mile pylon \"pathway\" spanning almost the width of Wales, in order to connect to the national grid. Although it is the local council and Welsh government who grant planning permission, the reason the power lines have to run such a long way is that there are a limited number of points, which are controlled by the UK government, where big power projects can connect into the grid. And whoever is in charge of the next government has an incredibly difficult task on their hands: keeping energy bills low while millions are still struggling, ensuring energy security and hitting green energy targets. Projects like this one in Wales are part of that mix. But some local residents I have been speaking to have said the turbine construction would damage an existing forest, removing ancient trees along the pylon construction route.  \"It\u2019s destroying the environment in an attempt to save the environment\" is the refrain that I keep hearing. In recent years, there have been huge advances in the development of offshore wind, and residents here want the focus of the UK and Welsh governments on offshore renewable technology instead.  But Abi Beck of RenewableUK Cymru says onshore wind needs to remain part of the mix. \u201cOnshore wind is the cheapest, it\u2019s the quickest to build and it\u2019s the most readily deployable technology we have for renewable energy. \"And we desperately need to upscale the amount of renewable energy we produce if we are going to be anywhere near meeting our targets in the next decade,\" she says. The difficulty here is that the place the onshore wind is generated is a very long way from the place it can be plugged into the UK network. Green GEN Cymru says it is listening to residents' concerns but that \u201cthe existing network in Mid and West Wales does not have nearly enough capacity to connect all the new renewable energy we need for our homes and businesses, locally and nationally\". Llandovery farmer Dyfan Walters knows that only too well. \"We all know the infrastructure needs improving,\" he says. \"I\u2019m not against renewable energy.\" He and his wife, Carys, have just finished building their family farm on the land  Carys grew up on. Now there are plans for two pylons in their fields so they\u2019ve become members of the local Llandovery Pylon Steering Group. \"This plan isn\u2019t going to benefit anyone here in the Towy Valley,\" Dyfan says. \"It\u2019s to take energy to the grid which will be used by others.\" As a result, Dyfan thinks Green GEN should use the latest technology to send the wires underground rather than use pylons, whatever the cost might be to the company. That is the bind - those living in the valley feel they are being made to pay the price for green targets made more than 200 miles away in Westminster. Labour says it will work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. The Conservative Party says in its manifesto that it will \"ensure democratic consent for onshore wind\" and strike the right balance between energy security and the views of local communities. It says it seeks to ensure local areas that host onshore wind directly benefit, including potentially through energy bill discounts. The Liberal Democrats say they will accelerate the deployment of renewable power and deliver energy security by removing restrictions on new solar and wind power. Plaid Cymru says Wales should have full control over energy powers without any upper limit or conditions set by the UK government, and \"that the beauty of Wales\u2019 natural landscape should be preserved\". It says that large-scale pylon developments or solar developments should be considered in the context of their impact and alternative methods for linking renewable energy to the national grid should be implemented, including through the undergrounding of cables. Reform says that net zero is pushing up bills, damaging British industries like steel and making the UK less secure. It says the environment can be protected with more tree planting, more recycling and using less single-use plastics. The Green Party wants wind power to provide about 70% of the UK\u2019s electricity by 2030.  The SNP says it is committed to ensuring that at least 50% of energy consumption comes from renewable sources by 2030 \"by striking a balance between appropriate developments and our natural environment\". The floating wind turbines will be constructed at a new deep water terminal in Avonmouth. Neart na Gaoithe wind farm off the coast of Fife is expected to be completed by next summer. In Iceland scientists plan to drill down to magma to understand it and use it for energy production. In his first visit to the north east since taking office, the minister vowed support for North Sea workers. Plans to build five 180m high wind turbines are given the go-ahead by the Welsh government.

Hawaiian Electric was aware of infrastructure issues that could contribute to a wildfire threat but focused on shifting the company toward renewable energy rather than fixing problems, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The utility company concluded in 2019 that it needed to invest more in preventing its power lines from emitting sparks, among other issues. Consulting California's efforts to reduce wildfires, the company drafted a plan to install more insulated conductors, fire-retardant poles and more aggressive monitoring technology. The company barely pursued those goals over the next two years, however, investing less than $250,000 on wildfire projects, according to the Journal. It did not request state permission to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention until 2022. Instead, the company found itself focused on a state-mandated shift toward renewable energy.

        "text": "Last week, Pakistan witnessed a significant milestone in its energy transition as the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD launched its brand of electric vehicles in the country. This event signals a shift in Pakistan\u2019s transportation landscape and serves as a reminder of the broader global movement towards cleaner energy solutions.  The event is more than just a business story; it reflects the urgent need to replace fossil fuels as source of energy with sustainable alternatives.  Energy lies at the core of the climate crisis. Our current reliance on fossil fuels\u2014coal, oil, and gas\u2014is driving the planet\u2019s temperature to dangerous levels. The challenge of replacing these energy sources with cleaner alternatives is the greatest task humanity has ever faced. For most of history, humans relied on wood as their primary energy source. It wasn\u2019t until the 18th century that we began burning fossil fuels in significant quantities. This shift, which began in England, powered the Industrial Revolution. The immediate effects were evident\u2014cities choked with smoke, leading to millions of deaths annually from air pollution. However, the more insidious problem lay with the invisible carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. When we burn fossil fuels, we release vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. For instance, burning a gallon of gasoline produces about 22 pounds of CO2. This gas traps heat that would otherwise escape into space, initiating a warming process that has now brought the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere from 275 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial Revolution to about 420 ppm today.  In the mid-20th century, scientists began developing solar panels, initially for use in space. At first, these panels were prohibitively expensive, but over time, their costs have dropped dramatically. Similarly, wind power has become more affordable as engineers have built larger, more efficient turbines. Battery technology is also improving, making it easier to store energy for times when the sun isn\u2019t shining, or the wind isn\u2019t blowing. This is in stark contrast to fossil fuels, which become more expensive as easily accessible deposits are depleted. Where oil drillers once struck \u201cgushers,\u201d they now have to extract oil from deep beneath the ocean or from tar sands, a costly and environmentally damaging process. Today, renewable energy is often the cheapest source of power available, even before considering the immense economic cost of climate change. Despite the advantages of renewable energy, the transition away from fossil fuels is happening too slowly. One reason is inertia. Our global infrastructure is built around fossil fuels. There are over 1.4 billion vehicles on the world\u2019s roads, most of them running on gasoline or diesel. The network of refineries, pipelines, and gas stations that keep these vehicles running is vast and entrenched. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a promising alternative. They are quieter, have fewer moving parts, and are often superior to their gasoline-powered counterparts. Yet, it could take decades for gas cars to disappear entirely, we don\u2019t but we are not left with that much time if we are to address climate change effectively. And while governments are beginning to promote EVs and subsidize their purchase, more concerted action is needed to phase out fossil-fuel-powered cars and other transporting infrastructure. Inertia, however, isn\u2019t the biggest obstacle. The most significant barrier to change comes from vested interests. Fossil fuel companies and the nations that depend on them for revenue have a lot to lose if the world transitions to renewable energy too quickly. For them, the shift to renewables is a disaster because it could strand their remaining stocks of hydrocarbons\u2014oil, gas, and coal\u2014rendering them worthless. These vested interests wield enormous power. ExxonMobil was once the world\u2019s largest company, and nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia derive most of their wealth and influence from fossil fuels. In the United States, the Koch brothers, major oil and gas barons, have been the biggest political donors in history. This influence has allowed the fossil fuel industry to delay action on climate change for decades. As far back as the 1970s, oil companies like ExxonMobil knew about the dangers of global warming. Their scientists accurately predicted the rise in temperatures we\u2019re seeing today, and company executives believed them\u2014so much so that they started building drilling rigs higher to account for rising sea levels. Yet, instead of warning the public, the industry hired public relations experts to cast doubt on the science of climate change, a strategy that delayed meaningful action for nearly 30 years. Despite these efforts, the tide is beginning to turn. A growing citizens\u2019 movement has pushed institutions to divest from fossil fuels, making it harder for these companies to raise capital. Activists are blocking pipelines and coal terminals, slowing the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure. The shift to renewable energy won\u2019t be without challenges. Mining the minerals needed for solar panels and batteries comes with its own environmental costs, and there will be debates over the aesthetics of wind turbines. However, renewable energy offers a more democratic energy future.  Sun and wind are available everywhere, unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a few places, often giving undue power to those who control them. For the nearly billion people who still lack access to modern energy, renewable sources offer a cheaper, faster solution than traditional fossil fuel infrastructure. The idea that we can produce energy by simply pointing a sheet of glass at the sun is nothing short of miraculous. In rural areas, such as parts of Sindh, people are experiencing the benefits of this new technology\u2014refrigeration for the first time, light for evening study, and more. This technology, if deployed widely and quickly, could help slow global warming and give humanity a fighting chance. We stand at a critical moment in history, one where we must stop burning things on Earth and instead rely on the energy from the sun. This is our best hope for a sustainable future. As the launch of BYD\u2019s electric vehicles in Pakistan demonstrates, the technology for a cleaner, greener future is already here.  It represents not just an advancement in transportation but a beacon of hope in our battle against climate change.  Embracing such innovations wholeheartedly is key to mitigating the climate crisis and ensuring a livable planet for future generations. The BYD launch serves as a powerful reminder that we have the tools we need to make this transition\u2014what we need now is the will to use them.

Continuing to require the use of these green energy products will cede economic power to China, giving China control of American energy security. Only by using its own oil and natural gas resources and passing prudent trade, tax, and regulatory policy can America remain strong and energy-independent. Select a Section  1/0 \u00a0 This Special Report documents how costly green policies will make America dependent on China and harm American energy, economic, and national security. The U.S. is currently one of the largest energy producers in the world, which should be a significant advantage over China, which is the world\u2019s largest energy importer. But China is trying to turn the tables by dominating the green energy infrastructure mandated by American politicians\u2014an infrastructure to which the American Left is addicted. The goals of American energy policy should be crystal clear: Under Chinese law, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exerts influence over major Chinese enterprises, including by forcing the transfer of any information related to \u201cnational security.\u201dREF Nevertheless, under policies being adopted by the Biden\u2013Harris Administration, the United States is drifting perilously close to dependence on CCP-controlled supply chains that are essential for any \u201cgreen energy\u201d transition. Recent U.S. government mandates requiring electrificationREF and a switch from domestic legacy fuels to wind and solar powerREF further exacerbate this dependence, aligning perfectly with CCP objectives outlined in China\u2019s Made in China 2025 campaign.REF If continued, the Biden\u2013Harris Administration\u2019s extreme and progressive climate and energy policies will handcuff America to China\u2019s critical minerals, electronic components, and green energy industries, thereby dangerously undermining U.S. national security. The imposition of mandatory electrification will weaken America\u2019s economy and disproportionately hurt lower-income Americans by raising energy and transportation costs.REF This Special Report, the third paper in The Heritage Foundation\u2019s Chinese Handcuffs series,REF analyzes China\u2019s predatory trade practices, unyielding cyber aggression, and advantages in supplies of critical minerals and renewable supply chains. It suggests that four more years of the Left\u2019s green energy policies will indebt the nation through subsidies and high energy costs while reducing global temperatures only by a fraction of a degree by 2100.REF China\u2019s Accession to the WTO. China\u2019s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 had countless unforeseen negative consequences. Western leaders believed that Chinese participation would catalyze comprehensive economic reforms and adherence to international trade standards in the growing Asian power.REF Not only did this not happen, but Chinese subsidies undercut prices in Western countries. This benefited Western consumers, who took advantage of inexpensive imports, but harmed Western producers, who lost market share. While inaccurately characterized as a developing nation,REF China has fortified its authoritarian economy, propping up green industries with massive subsidies through government guidance funds (GGFs) and state-owned enterprises. According to a 2023 Congressional Research Service brief, the CCP has channeled money into 1,800 GGFs for domestic research and development (R&D) and overseas acquisitions. These GGFs are investment vehicles that have attracted $627 billion in private capital and have a capital target amount of $1.5 trillion.REF The system is carefully orchestrated to raise the short-term profits of foreign companies that want access to China\u2019s substantial domestic market, and this has led to a long-term loss of U.S. jobs and rampant intellectual property (IP) theft. The deep-rooted problems arising from China\u2019s premature WTO entry are clear. The organization's framework and dispute settlement mechanisms have frustrated America\u2019s attempts to rein in China\u2019s non-compliant trade practices.REF This failure not only has eroded the integrity of what had been a rules-based global trading system, but also has disadvantaged countless other nations. Despite commitments that it made during the WTO accession process, China has repeatedly fallen short in enforcing IP protection. This has resulted in thefts of trade secrets from Western countries and forced technology transfers that in turn have reduced returns for foreign companies operating in China and undermined the foundational principles of free trade. Forced Technology Transfers and Cyber Espionage. Forced technology transfers are a stark reality for foreign companies operating in China, threatening intellectual property rights and true free-market comparative advantages. Under the guise of joint venture requirements, foreign enterprises find themselves compelled to partner with Chinese firms as a precondition for market entry.REF These partnerships often come with the expectation that critical technologies and trade secrets will be shared. On other occasions, intellectual property is stolen by agents operating inside China.REF Ultimately, many companies have parted with key technology and intellectual property, jeopardizing their long-term growth prospects in exchange for a temporary opportunity to profit by selling in China\u2019s billion-person market.REF Intellectual property theft enables Chinese firms to use stolen information to enhance their competitiveness, often against the very companies that provided the information. This theft is inherent in China\u2019s approach to foreign business engagement. Some estimates suggest that China steals between $225 billion and $600 billion worth of goods and IP every year from the United States.REF Since the President of the Supreme People's Court has expressly written that Chinese courts should first serve Chinese Communist Party and industrial policy goals, this lack of the rule of law jeopardizes IP protection and enforcement for all foreign rights holders in China.REF Additionally, China has been identified in the 2023 Annual Threat Assessment from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence as \u201crepresent[ing] the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S. Government and private-sector networks.\u201dREF Thousands of hacking efforts by China occur every day. The CCP-established Unit 61398 of the People\u2019s Liberation Army is known to U.S. cyber experts as Advanced Persistence Threat 1 (APT1). It is the branch of the Chinese military that is responsible for infiltrating industrial control systems of America\u2019s critical industries and engaging in cyberattacks abroad.REF Nearly 80 percent of organizations using supervisory control and data acquisition or industrial control systems have reported security breaches in the past two years.REF Inverter-based resources such as solar and wind pose a unique threat because of their poor cybersecurity and remote and unprotected nature.REF The CCP has recently created a specialized hacking group called Volt Typhoon that has infiltrated critical infrastructure across the United States according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).REF Volt Typhoon\u2019s penetration of the industrial control systems of key sectors, including communications, energy, and water, is alarming and could potentially overheat data servers, disrupt control systems, and manipulate surveillance cameras, posing grave risks to essential services.REF Moody's has reclassified these critical infrastructure assets as \u201ccredit negative\u201d due to the systematic cyber risks from state and non-state actors.REF Chinese vs. American Green Subsidies. The CCP uses government subsidies to control industrial development. In a 2022 study, the Center for Strategic and International Studies conservatively estimated that China spent about $400 billion (adjusted by purchasing power parity) on industrial policy support in 2019.REF Bloomberg estimates that in 2022, Chinese investment accounted for $546 billion of the global $1.1 trillion in green energy spending.REF This is not an investment as America would understand it: It is a concerted campaign to corner the market in green infrastructure. For comparison, America spent $141 billion in direct government subsidies for solar, wind, electric vehicle (EV), and advanced energy manufacturing in addition to $360 billion in U.S. private investment in green technologies during the Biden\u2013Harris Administration. In other words, China spent more in a single year\u20142022\u2014than America has spent over the past four years on green energy in addition to its decades of previous expenditures through government guidance funds. The so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) championed by the Biden\u2013Harris AdministrationREF has also extended and expanded U.S. government subsidies that it is estimated will cost $359 billion between 2025 and 2028. Even if the IRA spending is retained, however, the CCP will still spend more than the United States spends on green energy subsidies. Chart 1 illustrates the $495 billion in U.S. \u201cgreen energy\u201d subsidies that it is projected will have been spent under current law during the Biden\u2013Harris Administration and the coming four years. \u00a0  \u00a0 The Department of the Treasury projects that spending related to clean-emission vehicles will total $125 billion between 2025 and 2028. This includes a credit of up to $7,500 for new electric or fuel cell vehicles purchased in 2023. During the same period, it is estimated that $79 billion and $72 billion, respectively, will be spent on advanced energy manufacturing production and energy production tax credits, which provide tax benefits based on the production of items like batteries and renewable electricity, and that $20 billion and $63 billion, respectively, will be spent on advanced energy manufacturing investment and energy investment tax credits, which allow for a maximum 30 percent write-off for creating renewable power plants or factories producing specified green or transmission products. China\u2019s Manipulation of the Critical Minerals Market.REF The U.S. Geological Survey lists 50 critical minerals that are \u201cessential to the economic or national security of the United States, have a supply chain that is vulnerable to disruption, and serve an essential function in the manufacturing of a product, the absence of which would have significant consequences for the economic or national security of the United States.\u201dREF Among these critical minerals are the rare earth elements that are largely contained in the Lanthanide series of elements. These elements are considered rare because of how diffuse they are within the Earth\u2019s crust, which makes mining for a specific ore particularly challenging. These materials are essential in various high-tech applications such as metallurgy, batteries, catalysts, lasers, medical imaging, and electronic components. The favored position of Chinese industries depends on controlling the supply chains of these critical minerals and rare earth elements. Chart 2 lists 13 critical minerals and shows Chinese control of their production, particularly gallium, refined magnesium, and tungsten production. China dominates this sector and controls: \u00a0  \u00a0 According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if the projected green transition were to occur, the world would require a threefold to sevenfold increase in the global production of rare earth elements by 2040.REF Under current market structure, by far the largest portion of this increase would be controlled by China. Permanent magnets account for 38 percent of the rare earth element market, the catalyst industry accounts for 23 percent, and alloys for batteries and metallurgy account for 17 percent. The largest category of magnets\u2014the high-powered rare earth magnets (often\u00a0a combination of neodymium, iron, and boron)\u2014are used in 76 percent of offshore and 32 percent of land-based wind turbines.REF This technology structure has tied necessary inputs to the wind industry directly to the CCP. Additionally, the IEA expects a fortyfold increase in the demand for lithium by 2040 as part of the green transition.REF China today produces around half of the lithium carbonate needed by global industry, and the CCP is purchasing large stakes in lithium mines in African countries such as Zimbabwe.REF According to the Griffith Asia Institute at Australia\u2019s Griffith University, the CCP\u2019s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) increased its \u201cengagement\u201d in technology, such as batteries, EVs, car parts, and telecommunications manufacturing, by 1,046 percent and its \u201cengagement\u201d in mining and metal refining by 158 percent between 2022 and 2023.REF For example, the BRI has been investing in lithium mines in Mali, lithium processing in Zimbabwe, copper processing in Saudi Arabia, nickel mines and solar cell factories in Indonesia, and EV factories in Thailand. These expenditures by GGFs and Chinese industry not only provide inputs to China\u2019s domestic supply chains, but also provide resources for the Biden\u2013Harris Administration\u2019s green energy projects. By contrast, similar projects in the United States take more time to acquire permits and finish the required environmental impact statements. For example, new American mines take an average of 16.5 years to move from discovery to development, even though the actual construction takes only five years of that time, according to the IEA.REF China has recently banned exports of graphite, gallium, and germanium as well as technologies used in rare earth extraction and separation.REF The CCP may be pulling ahead in a number of sectors, such as solvent extraction technology for rare earth elements, which will increase its capacity for large-scale rare earth element extraction.REF If these technological advances come to fruition, China will gain a strategic advantage in refining future critical mineral deposits. Access to Critical Minerals Blocked by the Biden\u2013Harris Administration. Unfortunately, the Biden\u2013Harris Administration has held up several critical minerals projects in the United States because of Environmental Protection Agency rules and regulations. The blocking of copper and nickel mining is likely illegal now that the Supreme Court has rolled back agency actions that depart from written statutes,REF and such illegality is especially troubling when one considers that the Biden Department of Energy\u2019s July 2023 Critical Minerals Assessment characterizes these two minerals as critical to electrification in the medium term.REF The Biden\u2013Harris Administration has restricted access to critical minerals in the United States, most recently by blocking the Ambler Road Copper Mine in Alaska.REF The following projects were blocked in 2023: \u00a0  \u00a0 Chart 3 shows that both applications to mine and approvals to mine declined substantially during the Administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. In 2011, companies submitted 72 applications for mines to the Bureau of Land Management, which approved 37. By 2015, applications had declined to 33 and approvals to 22. Applications rose to more than 40 during the Trump Administration, but by 2022, applications were at 14 and approvals at six. The only bright spot for domestic mining in recent years has been the restarting of the rare earth Mountain Pass Mine in California that was shut down in 2002.REF Today, that mine produces about 15 percent of global rare earths but ships most of the ores to China for processing because of a lack of the necessary infrastructure in the United States.REF The story of China\u2019s rising dominance in EVs is inseparable from the success of China\u2019s battery industry because batteries make up around a third of the cost of EVs.REF Chart 4 shows that China produced 85 percent of the world\u2019s electric batteries in 2023, and Chart 5 shows that production of the EV battery components is dominated by China. A lithium-based battery\u2019s cathode needs such minerals as phosphorous, cobalt, manganese, or nickel, and the anode needs either natural or synthetic graphite. China controls 82 percent of the world\u2019s mining of the natural graphite used in these battery anodes.REF In addition, copper is increasingly vital to the manufacturing of electric batteries, and China controlled \u201cmore than 44 percent of global refined copper production\u201d in 2023.REF Since EVs contain four times more copper than is required for gasoline-powered automobiles,REF this refined copper production is largely going to the production of EVs. An International Energy Forum study by Cornell University Professor Emeritus Lawrence Cathles and University of Michigan Professor Adam Simon concludes that \u201c[t]o electrify the global vehicle fleet requires bringing into production 55% more new mines than would otherwise be needed.\u201dREF China controls 72 percent of lithium refining, 53 percent of phosphate refining, and 68 percent of cobalt refining capacity.REF These critical rare earth elements are also necessary for producing cathodes in batteries. The CCP has given the Chinese battery company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the largest such company in the world, funding to control\u00a025 percent of the cobalt reserves\u00a0in the Republic of Congo in Africa, where forced labor and child labor are used in the mining of cobalt for batteries.REF \u00a0  \u00a0  \u00a0 Chart 6 shows that China produces 66 percent of EVs, while Europe produces 22 percent and the United States produces only 10 percent. The Chinese Communist Party has subsidized its domestic EV market by $28 billion between 2009 and 2020 and plans to spend another $72 billion between 2023 and 2026.REF These subsidies include sales tax exemptions, R&D grants, and infrastructure subsidies. Many Chinese companies were incentivized to enter the battery industry because of these subsidies. Although a number of these companies failed, the creation of the first Tesla gigafactory in China gave others access to the Chinese-dominated supply chains that would be needed to make companies internationally competitive. In addition to subsidizing EVs, the CCP penalized the use of gasoline-powered vehicles. Chinese cities required owners of vehicles with internal combustion engines to bid tens of thousands of dollars for license plates and to drive only on certain days of the week.REF In contrast, owners of EVs generally get free license plates, can drive at any time, and are tax exempt.REF By spurring domestic EV growth, China ensures that its domestic auto market will shift to EVs. This builds up domestic manufacturing, which results in economies of scale. \u00a0  \u00a0 Moreover, China is building an ecosystem of technology around its batteries and charging stations for EVs. As has taken place in the past, China may be trying to use the technology to steal data from foreigners visiting areas domestically and abroad such as military bases, industrial sites, and government facilities by gathering data from the vehicles that use its charging stations.REF For example, batteries produced by CATL, a recipient of CCP government guidance funds, were installed as backups to a solar array close to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, home to the Marine Corps Special Operations Command. The base was forced to remove these batteries after Senator Marco Rubio (R\u2013FL) and two dozen other Republican lawmakers\u00a0sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanding an investigation.REF The Senators were concerned that passive sensor technology in batteries could send data back to China and reveal the base\u2019s energy demands during military exercises.REF According to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, CATL has ties to Beijing\u2019s\u00a0United Front Work Department.REF The department runs the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce overseas trade group, whose vice chairman, Zeng Yuquan, is the company\u2019s largest shareholder.REF Such a deeply intertwined relationship indicates clearly that companies such as CATL are not only corporate entities, but also instruments of state policy and intelligence gathering. At a minimum, these ties between the CCP and Chinese EV and battery companies call into question the wisdom of allowing imports of these vehicles into the United States. Coal-Powered Renewables that Won\u2019t Stop Climate Change. In their pursuit of an absolutist climate agenda, climate alarmists have ignored the threat posed by China\u2019s dominance of the production of renewable components. They have ignored China\u2019s abysmal environmental record and economic manipulation, advocated for U.S. subsidies for renewables, and restricted the development of mines within America. At the same time, U.S. companies are purchasing solar panels made with slave labor in China and driving Chinese electric vehicles with components that are produced using coal-fired power plants. In 2022, China permitted, on average, two coal-fired power plants a week, partly to supply power to battery and solar component factories.REF China also produces 2,000 tons of toxic waste for every ton of rare earths elements extracted.REF The environmentally destructive ways China has extracted critical minerals have contributed to China\u2019s loss of forested land. From 2000 to 2023, China lost 7.4 percent of its tree cover, and from 2002 to 2023, it lost 4.7 percent of its primary forest.REF The Lowy Institute estimates that due to industrial activity, 80 percent to 90 percent of the groundwater is no longer suitable for drinking, and almost 50 percent of aquifers contain water that is not fit for farming or industry.REF The federal government\u2019s Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change shows that complete elimination of American carbon emissions would reduce global temperatures by only two-tenths of one degree Celsius by 2100.REF This is because Asia, Africa, and Latin America are not reducing their emissions. China produces more than 30 percent of the world\u2019s annual greenhouse gases; America accounts for only 14 percent.REF China, along with the rest of the world, has rapidly been adding to global CO2 emissions; U.S. emissions have declined by 1,000 million metric tons in the past 15 years, largely due to the replacement of coal power plants by combined-cycle natural gas plants.REF According to Chart 7, China\u2019s CO2 emissions nearly doubled those of the U.S. in 2022. \u00a0  \u00a0 Even if Western countries decided not to import renewable energy, China plans to deploy four times more renewable energy capacity than the European Union (EU) and five times more than America from 2023\u20132028.REF China claims that by 2030, \u201calmost half\u201d of its energy will be produced by renewables,REF but China has a record of broken promises. In 2023, for example, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping announced that China\u2019s carbon emissions would no longer peak in 2030 as China had previously promised when it signed onto the Paris Agreement.REF Solar: An Industry Exploiting Forced Labor. There are often challenges to connecting solar arrays to electrical grids because of the difficulties of transmission. In order to make solar more attractive, China has subsidized solar investments by approximately 50 percent to 70 percent.REF America has tried to match Chinese solar investment with a 30 percent tax credit.REF From 2014\u20132021 (the years for which the most recent data are available), the Chinese government provided almost $50 billion in subsidies to solar projects. This expenditure weakened the Chinese economy but allowed Chinese manufacturers to capture over 70 percent of the global market share.REF \u00a0  \u00a0 China currently dominates the solar supply chain. The International Energy Agency concluded in 2022 that \u201cChina\u2019s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%. This is more than double China\u2019s share of global PV demand.\u201dREF However, China uses forced labor to manufacture potentially 79 percent of polysilicon, 97 percent of wafers, 75 percent of modules, and 85 percent of solar cells used in the solar industry.REF This reduction in cost has allowed China to dominate the industry, as shown in Chart 8. The\u00a0United Nations,REF the\u00a0EU,REF the U.S.\u00a0Department of Labor,REF and the\u00a0U.S. Department of State have published reports about the use of forced labor in industries that are tied to renewable energy supply chains.REF The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates\u00a0that more than\u00a0a million minorities, chiefly Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz\u2014defined by China as \u201csurplus labour\u201d according to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human RightsREF\u2014have been subjected to mass detention, pervasive surveillance, and forced labor.REF In its bid to dominate solar panel production,\u00a0China\u00a0has forced these \u201csurplus\u201d workers to labor in four of the world\u2019s five largest\u00a0polysilicon factories and in coal-fired\u00a0power plants.REF This exploitation is one reason why China\u2019s share of global polysilicon production rose from 62 percent in 2016 to 83 percent in 2022. America\u2019s share declined from 35 percent to 5 percent over the same period.REF Not only have buyers of solar panels been indirectly funding companies that use slave labor, but American taxpayers have also subsidized almost $37 billion\u00a0in purchases\u00a0between 2016 and 2022.REF The U.S. Department of Energy has calculated that without components sourced from forced labor in\u00a0China, the cost of solar components could rise by 30 percent to 40 percent.REF In 2021, in response to these labor practices, Congress passed a law signed by President Biden, popularly known as the Uighur Forced Labor Act, which prohibited imports of solar components made with slave labor.REF However, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported\u00a0that China was shipping solar components made with forced labor to Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, where they would be assembled and then sent to America as the products of these countries to avoid the import prohibition.REF\u00a0Collectively, these three countries plus Malaysia, which is not engaging in the practice, now account for\u00a080 percent of U.S.\u00a0panel supplies.REF Trina Solar, which used Solar World\u2019s technology in PERC solar cells, was found to be operating in Thailand. Transmission and Wind: Further Dependence on China. With more than 1,080 gigawatts (GWs) of solar and 366 GWs of wind waiting to connect in 2023, the U.S. had a significant backlog of subsidized renewable projects, often permitted to build in remote areas where land is plentiful.REF However, construction in such locations necessitates a large build-out in expensive transmission infrastructure. These projects often take decades to complete and are highly dependent on large, globe-spanning supply chains. For example, 82 percent of large power transformers come from abroad, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.REF Additionally, the Department of Energy found that the Asia-Pacific region accounts for 39 percent of market share by revenue.REF These large power transformers are used mostly by the wind industry to transmit electricity from rural areas to urban centers. \u00a0  \u00a0 Chart 9 shows that China has a 66 percent market share in the global wind turbine market. With such a high market share, China holds a dominant position in the wind industry. Since 76 percent of offshore and 32 percent of land-based wind turbines use rare earth permanent magnets, China\u2019s dominance in rare earths has also contributed to its disproportionate control of the wind industry.REF The forced transition to renewable energy and electrified transportation is weakening America and helping China. The obvious solution is for America to remove requirements and subsidies to use these technologies and instead let individuals, companies, and utilities decide on their preferred technologies. A level playing field would get rid of many of the problems described in this Special Report. Regardless of whether or not America\u2019s leadership continues with a forced transition to electric and renewable technology, federal and state politicians should allow, not block, domestic development of the critical minerals required for U.S. production. The current policy of requiring wind, solar, and electrification of vehicles and appliances while banning production of their essential inputs leaves America dependent on China. China has created a cost advantage in producing renewables, batteries, and electric vehicles. The government of China has a stake in every major Chinese company and artificially sets prices and production targets. Chinese wage rates are disproportionately low due to forced labor. The cost of energy is lower because the CCP has not implemented many of the clean air requirements implemented in America and Europe. Xi Jinping has specifically abandoned his former pledge to peak Chinese emissions in 2030 and then reduce them thereafter. The cost of capital is lower because the CCP awards loans at favored rates to important companies. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, as the CCP subsidizes these companies in numerous other ways. In addition to its cost advantage, China has made strategic purchases of foreign assets in order to develop its portfolio of critical minerals. The combination of cost advantage and access to critical minerals enables China to dominate global markets. China is not forcing America to purchase its products, but America is making itself dependent on China by choosing to use federal and state regulations to require that the United States and individual states use renewable energy and electric vehicles. This reduces jobs for American workers and increases jobs for Chinese workers. It slows U.S. economic growth because green energy is more expensive than oil, gas, coal, and nuclear. It sacrifices American national security interests because China is not an American ally, and it is therefore unwise to depend on China for a vital section of the American economy. Below are a series of steps that would allow America to free itself from its Chinese handcuffs, abandon mandates that encourage the use of Chinese products, and make use of America\u2019s own domestic resources of oil and natural gas, as well as radionuclides. By leveraging mechanisms within the WTO, stealing or co-opting IP from foreign companies, and buying out foreign companies with government guidance funds, China has succeeded in dominating the world\u2019s supply chains in green energy products and components. If America continues to require the use of these green energy products, it will cede economic power to China, giving China control of American energy security. America is making itself weaker and China stronger by passing a set of laws and enacting regulations that benefit an adversary. Only by abandoning green energy and vehicle mandates and subsidies, making use of its own domestic oil and natural gas resources, and passing prudent trade, tax, and regulatory policy will America continue to be strong and energy-independent.

        "summary": "China has dominated the world's supply chains in green energy products and components, which could compromise American energy security. The US is currently one of the largest energy producers in the world, but China is trying to turn the tables by dominating the green energy infrastructure mandated by American politicians. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exerts influence over major Chinese enterprises, including by forcing the transfer of information related to \"national security.\" The Biden-Harris Administration's green energy policies will further exacerbate US dependence on CCP-controlled supply chains. China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 had unforeseen negative consequences, including Chinese subsidies undercutting prices in Western countries. The CCP uses government subsidies to control industrial development, including in the green energy sector. China dominates the production of critical minerals and rare earth elements essential for green energy technologies. The US government's restrictions on domestic mining and lack of investment in critical minerals have hindered American production. By abandoning green energy and vehicle mandates and subsidies, making use of its own domestic oil and natural gas resources, and passing prudent trade, tax, and regulatory policy, America can continue to be strong and energy-independent."

Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire, says his Hermon facility uses up to 55,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month and that the rising cost of electricity is causing him to increase prices on his retread tires. He says he has lost customers to retread facilities in New Hampshire, which has lower energy costs and no sales tax.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  Manufacturers in Maine are pushing back against electricity costs that rose sharply this summer as a result of state policy meant to encourage the use of solar and wind power. The Public Utilities Commission is again looking into how much of a power bill should be used to incentivize renewable energy projects. Manufacturers, policymakers, utilities and others agree that Maine must add more solar and wind energy to reach targets for reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Disagreements focus on how to apportion the cost. The recent change in how rates are calculated has particularly angered large consumers of electricity. Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire Inc. \u2013 a significant energy user that retreads more than 34,000 truck tires a year \u2013 said his electricity bill is up $10,000 a year at his Hermon site, adding to the $15,000 a month he\u2019s already paying for 50,000 to 55,000 kilowatt-hours each month, depending on production. \u201cThat\u2019s $10,000 going out the door, for what?\u201d he said. \u201cI just don\u2019t understand.\u201d Maine Commercial Tire, which has been in business for 34 years, faces competitors who do business in low-tax states such as New Hampshire, Lynch said. He was one of several business owners who complained to regulators about the steep increase.Advertisement Milo Chip, a paper products manufacturer that employs four workers, told the PUC its monthly bill is up by $6,000. That brings the full monthly electric bill to more than $10,000, office manager Isabelle McKenna said, adding the business may be forced to close in the near future. A hardwood and softwood pulp inventory should provide a few weeks of chipping, she said. The company has been in business for 12 years. \u201cIt is so horrible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not sustainable.\u201d HOW WE GOT HERE\u00a0 State policy requires utilities to collect ratepayer money as part of the net energy billing program that provides generators with credit for renewable power they produce and send to the electric grid. Ratepayers also help fund Maine\u2019s low-income assistance program and some storm recovery costs. The PUC decided in April 2023 that Versant Power and Central Maine Power should collect money by charging ratepayers a fixed monthly fee as well as others based on electricity use. The revised rates didn\u2019t kick in until this past July for customers of Versant, which serves northern and eastern Maine. The retread facility at Maine Commercial Tire uses the bulk of the electricity at the company\u2019s Hermon location says Jim Lynch, co-founder of the tire company.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  The fixed rates vary by customer class such as residential, small business, small commercial, medium commercial, large commercial and industrial.Advertisement Electricity use varies significantly among customers in the different classes. Each customer in a particular class pays the same fixed charge regardless of how much electricity is used. Other rates are based on how much electricity is used. Generators of renewable energy also are feeling the impact of sharply higher rates. \u201cI have yet to hear from a member who has benefited from the rate design,\u201d said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. In July, just as some were noticing their bills climb, the PUC launched an investigation into the alternate rate designs and may order changes to \u201cadjust for inequities or to effectuate legislative policy directives. \u201d Regulators said an analysis showed that the fixed charge affected some larger rate classes \u201cdramatically.\u201d Low electricity users in some classes are paying much more than if billed only on the volume of electricity used and large users in some classes paying much less. Several manufacturers met recently with representatives of the Governor\u2019s Energy Office, which said it encouraged businesses to participate in the PUC investigation and will ask regulators to act expeditiously in reviewing the effects of the rate change. DESIGNING EQUITABLE RATESAdvertisement Versant Power said rates that took effect July 1 increased bills for 55 of 76 large customers \u2013 classified based on electricity consumption, voltage and other factors \u2013 and doubled or more than doubled the bills of 11. Billed amounts decreased for the remainder. Curing chambers, which heat tires for three hours prior to a retread being applied to them, are one of Maine Commercial Tire\u2019s biggest electricity draws, according to Jim Lynch, co-founder of the Hermon company.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  Net energy billing rules have vexed state lawmakers and regulators for years. Gov. Janet Mills and the Legislature expanded eligibility in 2019, directing utilities to buy power from solar projects with up to 5 megawatts of capacity at fixed rates. The change led to a significant rise in community solar projects, raising questions about the cost of the subsidy. Deciding how to pay to promote renewable energy has\u00a0also led to more PUC cases that make an already complicated issue even more difficult to decipher. The Maine Renewable Energy Association urged regulators to consolidate cases \u201cthat can address all of the issues and produce a rate design that is equitable.\u201d \u201cAs these lengthy proceedings have amply demonstrated, inequitable results require even more dockets to achieve a rate design that is equitable and within the PUC\u2019s legislative mandate,\u201d the group said. Tony Buxton, a Portland lawyer who represents the Industrial Energy Consumer Group that speaks for manufacturers, said the issue is inscrutable to most electricity customers. \u201cA typical ratepayer has no chance of understanding how to follow this,\u201d he said. And Public Advocate William Harwood called the process \u201cprocedurally very messy.\u201d AN EMERGENCY FOR BUSINESSES Falling costs for solar panels also undermine the case for sizable ratepayer subsidies for the solar industry, said Patrick Woodcock, president and chief executive officer of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce. \u201cIt makes no sense that we compensate . . . to the extent we are,\u201d said Woodcock, who directed the Maine Energy Office under then-Gov. Paul LePage. Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire, says rising electricity costs are becoming an emergency for businesses.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  Lynch, the co-founder of the commercial tire facility, said businesses in Maine face an emergency over rising electricity costs. \u201cIt\u2019s time we pulled the fire alarm,\u201d he said.

        "summary": "Manufacturers in Maine are complaining about sharply increased electricity costs, which they say are threatening their businesses. The cost hike is due to a change in how rates are calculated, which is intended to promote the use of solar and wind power. Large consumers of electricity are particularly affected, with some seeing their bills increase by thousands of dollars. Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire, says his electricity bill has increased by $10,000 a year, making it difficult to compete with businesses in low-tax states like New Hampshire. Another business, Milo Chip, says its monthly bill has increased by $6,000, threatening its survival. The Maine Public Utilities Commission is investigating the rate changes and may make adjustments to address inequities. The commission's decision to charge a fixed monthly fee, as well as rates based on electricity use, has been criticized for unfairly burdening large consumers. The Maine Renewable Energy Association is also concerned about the impact of the rate changes on renewable energy generators. The state's net energy billing program has been a source of controversy for years, with questions about how to fairly apportion the cost of promoting renewable energy. The Governor's Energy Office is encouraging businesses to participate in the PUC investigation and is pushing for a quick resolution to the issue."

        "text": "A solar energy study published in June by California's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is making headlines, as seen in The Mercury News. That's because the report details how \u2014\u00a0and where \u2014\u00a0rooftop solar owners see the biggest savings. The good news is that 76% of households studied nationwide saw reduced energy costs, averaging $691. That's after deducting expenses for putting in the system, all according to a summary of the findings from Berkeley. The savings are around $1,987 if the installation costs aren't factored out, per the study, which the experts call a rare examination. \"Few studies quantify the impact of rooftop solar on\" energy burden, they wrote in an abstract published in the journal Nature Communications, via Springer Nature. The analysis, which included 500,000 households, had great news for low-to-moderate-income homeowners. The energy burden reductions were \"most pronounced\" for this group, ranging from $660 to $711. The benefits are greatest in the West and Northeast, where energy costs are typically higher. The South registered the least benefit, due to low electricity prices in the region. Other factors also reduced the savings in certain situations, but most homeowners were in the black, all per Berkeley's report. Absent from the analysis are longer-term benefits of using renewable energy. Solar panels do not release planet-warming fumes when generating power. They also have a life span of 30-plus years, offering free sunpower long after the systems are paid for, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration notes. NASA has linked air pollution to increased risks for severe weather, which is causing more property damage. This, in turn, has caused some insurance companies to raise premiums or discontinue service in heavily storm-hit areas of the country. While one rooftop solar setup isn't going to save the planet, it's part of a growing trend that can contribute to cleaner air in the future, hopefully mitigating some of the worst-case scenarios, feared by climate experts such as those at MIT News. The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that the sector has experienced an average annual growth rate of 25% during the last 10 years. And it's easier than ever to become a part of the trend. EnergySage is a free, online tool that can help you identify all the tax breaks, find the right products, and hire the best installers. Solar installations can qualify for a 30% tax credit on setup costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The benefit expires in 2035 unless lawmakers renew it. \"Our goal has always been to make clean energy more accessible and affordable for everyone, and this expansion allows us to reach an even larger audience,\" EnergySage COO Charlie Hadlow said in a press release in July about his company's marketplace expanding to all 50 states. The growth is timely, as Berkeley's analysts have offered perhaps the best evidence yet that solar energy is a worthwhile, money-saving move. \"Rooftop solar effectively reduced energy costs for the great majority of U.S. adopters,\" the experts wrote in the Nature Communications summary.

After a long and tumultuous journey of 70 years, India achieved the milestone of electrifying all the inhabited census villages in India in April 2018 by providing electricity access to 18,374 villages under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana. Further, the Government of India electrified 2.8 crore households under Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (PM SAUBHAGYA) to achieve universal household electrification in 2021. It took around seventy years to shed off electrical virginity completely but are these statistics enough to assert that energy poverty has ceased to exist in India? The Encyclopedia of Social Work by Oxford University Press defines energy poverty as\u00a0a \u2018lack of access to adequate, high-quality, clean, and affordable forms of energy or energy systems\u2019. Going by this definition, even with the sustained dedicated efforts by the government, there lies vast scope to alleviate the energy poverty in India.  Electricity is primarily used for lighting, cooking, transport, heating (seasonal) etc. India generates around three-fourths of its electricity from coal. Given the impetus to phase down coal in the wake of climate change, it risks returning to the energy-poor era. Unlike renewables such as solar, wind and hydro, coal is not considered a clean and modern source of energy. From the perspective of the environment, the electricity generated from coal is not of high quality notwithstanding reliability and affordability.  Advertisement  One of the effective strategies to address energy poverty is the Decentralised Renewable Energy (DRE) such as off-grid solar, wind and biomass electricity generation. It has vast potential to ensure a steady supply of electricity to the remote and underserved communities inhabiting inaccessible and poorly connected areas. One such example is Bihar\u2019s first solar village- Dharnai. It got connected to a solar mini-grid in 2014 and the residents embraced the experience of glowing bulbs and rotating fans for the first time. There are further examples of such off-grid solar, wind, and hybrid energy systems in operation in Gujarat, Karnataka, and Rajasthan. The DREs have far-reaching positive effects across the economy, health, education, environment etc. However, the lack of maintenance and repair of mini-grids poses a severe challenge to electricity access as was reflected in the case of Dharnai itself. After three years of being operational, the mini-grid became defunct due to a lack of maintenance and unavailability of funds. In addition to providing access to electricity, the DRE can be leveraged to support the people\u2019s livelihoods. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has devised the framework for the promotion of decentralised renewable energy livelihood applications to guide central and state government departments, ministries and other stakeholders. The framework encapsulates that apart from providing energy access and job creation, the DRE would help in achieving self-reliant India by scaling up the current DRE livelihood applications and supporting the development of new DRE livelihood applications. The DRE-based livelihoods have vast applications in agriculture, agro-processing, dairy, poultry, fisheries, tailoring etc. The DRE livelihood applications require a holistic ecosystem incentivised to (i) deliver efficient appliances, ensure supply chains for manufacturers, operation and maintenance services, (ii) access to credit, (iii) robust backward and forward linkages by ensuring supply of inputs and market access, (iv) capacity building in the form of skill development and training, (v) dedicated cross-sectoral policies and de-risking tools. These five components facilitate an enabling environment for livelihoods based on DRE to thrive sustainably. The DRE livelihoods applications have immense potential in increasing agricultural production, powering rural businesses, improving community services such as healthcare and education, creating new business ventures, empowering women and developing sustainable tourism. However, the intermittency related to solar and wind affects the reliability of the power supply and this problem is exacerbated by insufficient energy storage solutions. The rural areas may have a lack of access to mechanical and technical expertise to repair DRE-powered appliances. Even the high upfront cost of the DRE and the appliances and inaccessibility of the subsidies and the finances discourage the uptake of DRE-based livelihoods. The projects and benefits relying on the grants and subsidies may even suffer in terms of economic sustainability. Inadequate understanding of the advantages of new technology can lead to resistance to their adoption. Barriers may also come from cultural preferences for conventional energy sources. In case of over-reliance on biomass for energy could lead to deforestation and environmental degradation if not managed sustainably. Waste management issues related to solar panel disposal and recycling must be addressed. DRE systems provide a viable option for reducing energy poverty while fostering sustainable development. In energy-poor areas, deploying renewable energy solutions should be prioritised to build resilient, self-sufficient communities that not only boost local economies but also positively impact global environmental goals. The broad implementation and integration of DRE technologies will determine the direction of energy access in the future and will be a major step towards just and sustainable global development. The writer is a research scholar, energy studies programme, at School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi  Advertisement  A new research article published in a peer-reviewed journal shows that India could cut its electricity costs by about 40 per cent with a rapid transition of its power sector from coal to renewables by 2050. Renewable energy has become cheaper than conventional energy sources simply by avoiding the cost of fuel that would otherwise need to be mined or, in the case of natural gas, imported to generate the same electricity.

        "text": "A surprising transportation method is optimizing how companies move heavy-duty materials to offshore wind farms, according to a recent article published in Electrek. \u00d8rsted, a Danish renewable energy company, has begun a new operational campaign. The company will deploy heavy-lift cargo drones to a Dutch offshore wind farm in an effort to reduce the time it takes to transport cargo to offshore wind turbines. Per reports by Electrek, the heavy-lift cargo drone can transport cargo weighing up to 220 pounds. For this new optional campaign, \u00d8rsted will transport materials from a vessel to all 94 wind turbines located at the 752-megawatt Borssele 1 & 2 offshore wind farm. \u00d8rsted will also be updating the evacuation and safety equipment for all its wind turbines. Before the use of heavy-lift cargo drones, a large vessel would sail to each wind turbine, transporting equipment boxes onto the transition piece with a crane. Then, the box would be lifted two more times until reaching the top of the turbine. The heavy-lift cargo drone eliminates the need for the cranes, flying back and forth from the supply vessel to the top of the turbine. This new process is not only more efficient but also much faster. It only takes the cargo drone four minutes to fly from the supply vessel to the top of the turbine \u2014 a drastic improvement compared to the original transport method, which typically took six hours. As a result, \u00d8rsted told Electrek it's been able to transport cargo at Borssele 10-15 times faster than normal thanks to the heavy-lift cargo drones. Optimizing offshore wind farms is a step toward a more sustainable future. As wind energy becomes more efficient, more companies will be encouraged to make the switch and help reduce the total amount of global pollution. \"The drones at Borssele 1 & 2\u2026will improve safety, bring down carbon emissions, and reduce the cost of operating offshore wind farms, which all further improve the commercial fundamentals of offshore wind for investors, governments, and corporations,\" Chief Commercial Officer and Deputy CEO at \u00d8rsted Rasmus Errboe told Electrek.

Learn More\n Key Points Interest rates aren't falling quickly, and the appetite for financing is falling on Wall Street. It was a bad week for electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy stocks across the board as consumer spending continues to struggle and EV competition heats up. It hasn't helped that interest rates are up and the economic future isn't certain, causing investors to take risk off the table in areas of energy that haven't proven to be profitable. According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, shares of Nikola (NKLA -0.52%) fell 11.5% this week as of 1:30 p.m. EDT on Friday, Plug Power (PLUG 9.80%) was down 13.2%, and Li Auto (LI 6.32%) fell 8.3%. And the drop in shares may not be over. The industry overall had a tough week. Earnings reports from Dollar General and Lululemon showed consumers trading down and potentially slowing their level of spending. Consumers drive the economy, so if there's weakness, it could impact everything from auto sales to electricity demand. While the Federal Reserve is still expected to cut rates next month, Atlanta's Fed chief said he wants to see more data before cutting rates. That caused the U.S. government's 10-year bond yield to rise about 10 basis points to 3.91% this week, making it more costly to finance projects.  There was also news that Canada will implement a 100% tariff on EV imports from China, which will reduce the market for companies like Li Auto. Trade wars are heating up in the auto industry, and that could make exports harder for companies producing in China. Nikola announced this week that Thomas Schmitt will take over as the company's chief commercial officer, CCO, aiming to bring the company's products to market more efficiently. But there are bigger problems than getting the commercial operations running better. The company announced a capital raise last week that will bring in an additional $80 million and the potential to increase to a sale of $160 million of convertible notes. As with most capital raises, this could be very dilutive to Nikola long term. This financial reality that more money is needed to execute the company's vision isn't something the market wanted to hear this week. The reality for these companies is their losses are mounting and new funding will be needed to keep the business going. But it's harder to raise money when your stock price falls, which is happening with all three.  PLUG data by YCharts. This is a downward spiral that is hard to get out of in any economic environment. And if interest rates aren't going to fall sharply and consumers aren't going to demand more EVs and clean energy vehicles, the market may not be as big as a lot of these companies hoped. The recent bankruptcies of companies like Fisker, SunPower, and Proterra have proven that there's an end to the ability to finance these businesses without making money.

Electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy stocks had a bad week due to struggling consumer spending and increasing competition. Interest rates are up, and the economic future is uncertain, causing investors to take risk off the table. Shares of Nikola, Plug Power, and Li Auto fell 11.5%, 13.2%, and 8.3%, respectively, as of Friday. The industry overall had a tough week, with earnings reports showing consumers trading down and potentially slowing their spending. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates next month, but Atlanta's Fed chief wants to see more data before doing so. Canada will implement a 100% tariff on EV imports from China, which will reduce the market for companies like Li Auto. Nikola announced a capital raise of $80 million, which could be dilutive to the company long term. The financial reality for these companies is that they need more funding to execute their vision, but it's harder to raise money when their stock price falls. If interest rates don't fall sharply and consumers don't demand more EVs and clean energy vehicles, the market may not be as big as these companies hoped."

        "text": "It\u2019s now almost an article of faith among energy writers in the bulk of the media that \u201crenewables\u201d are the best form of energy from an environmental point of view. After all, they spew forth no noxious gases. They are also cheap and getting cheaper. Some journalists even argue that they are free: you do not have to pay for sunshine or wind. However, a paper published this month argues that wind and solar are not cheaper than conventional fuels if the full cost of electricity (FCOE) to society is taken into account. Written by Lars Schernikau, William Hayden-Smith, and Rosemary Falcon, the paper, entitled \u201cFull Cost of Electricity (FCOE) and Energy Returns (eROI)\u201d appears in the Journal of Management and Sustainability published by the Canadian Centre of Science and Education.  Anthea Jeffery has drawn on this paper for part of her submission on behalf of the South African Institute of Race Relations to the parliamentary committee considering the Climate Change Bill.  All energy, the paper by the three authors argues, requires taking resources from the planet, processing them, and so harming the environment. Humanity\u2019s goal should be to minimise \u201cthese negative impacts\u201d by increasing efficiencies. Energy policy should have three objectives: affordability, security of supply, and environmental protection.  To ensure that energy policy promotes all three of these objectives the paper argues that both the FCOE and the eROI should be taken into account.  More commonly used is the levellised cost of electricity (LCOE). This, however, is misleading because it includes only three measures \u2013 the costs of building, fuel, and operation. FCOE, by contrast, measures the full costs of renewable energy to society. It is therefore a more comprehensive measure than the LCOE.  In the first place, there are mining, transportation, investment, and building costs. The mining of lithium and other minerals involves excavation of vast quantities of rock, which necessitates the use of fossil fuels, since wind and solar are too intermittent to be reliable for mining operations. Fossil fuels must also be used for transporting the minerals to wherever wind turbines, solar panels, and storage batteries (\u201cgreen machines\u201d) are manufactured.  Secondly, there is the cost of fuels, which is a strength for wind and solar, as they themselves have no fuel costs.  Thirdly, there are operating and maintenance costs. The paper says onshore wind and solar cost much the same as coal, but that offshore wind is much more expensive. Solar arrays are relatively cheap, however. Fourth, there is the cost of load balancing, necessary for the very difficult task of stabilizing the grid given the intermittency of wind and solar.  Fifth comes the cost of storage. Excess energy generated by wind and solar on windy and sunny days must be stored for when there is no wind or sunshine. Using fossil fuels, huge quantities of minerals must be mined and transported for battery manufacture. But the necessary storage technology has yet to be developed. This is a serious obstacle to the greater use of wind and solar, for an efficient electricity system must be able to meet demand at all times.  Sixth is the cost of backup. In the absence of sufficient storage capacity for wind and solar, back-up from conventional fossil fuel and/or nuclear energy is required. As the share of wind and solar energy increases, the use of back-up declines, which means that necessary but expensive back-up will lie idle for an increasing part of the time. This is wasteful.  Seventh is the cost of emissions. The CO2 emissions from fossil fuels for use in their own right must be calculated. But so must the emissions from all the fossil fuels used for mining, transporting, and manufacturing green machines.  The eighth factor to be considered is the cost of recycling and other environmental impacts. The paper argues that neither wind blades nor solar panels can be recycled, while the decaying of discarded batteries is environmentally harmful. So, as already noted, is all the mining needed for green machines.  Ninth is \u201croom costs\u201d, such as land footprint and energy sprawl. Because the intermittency of wind and solar means that they have a low power density, much more space is needed for turbines and solar panels than for conventional power stations. Stephen Davies of the American Institute for Economic Research has pointed out that you get plenty of energy from a small amount of coal or uranium, but that if you wanted to power Los Angeles entirely with solar, you would need to cover an area several times the size of that city with solar panels. Schernikau and his co-writers note that a new solar park in India would need 33 times as much space as a new coal-fired power station to produce the same amount of electricity.  Number ten is other metrics, such as the energy return on investment (eROI). This refers to the input of energy needed to produce the energy output needed. A high eROI means lower environmental and economic costs, and thus lower prices and higher utility. A low eROI means higher environmental and economic costs, and thus higher prices and lower utility.\u00a0\u00a0  The return on energy invested is highest for nuclear, followed at some distance by coal and gas, with renewables much further behind. \u201cThe principle of energy return on investment is at the core of society\u2019s energy efficiency, which is at the core of humanity\u2019s development and survival.\u201d  Schernikau et al argue that the very low return for wind and solar arises from their intermittency along with their need for backup and storage. Their very low return on energy invested means that they are \u201ca step backward in history in terms of energy efficiency\u201d.  The envisaged dramatic expansion in wind and solar will result in a more fragile and expensive electricity system, with the risk of prolonging the energy crisis that started in the second half of last year. This crisis they attribute to lack of investment in conventional forms of energy, while increased use of wind and solar has been unable to satisfy demand.  Schernikau and his colleagues also make the point that if solar and wind were truly cheaper, as is frequently claimed, they would not require \u201ctrillions of dollars of government funding or subsidies, or laws to enforce their installation\u201d.  * John Kane-Berman is a policy fellow at the IRR, a think-tank that promotes political and economic freedom.

The FCOE measures the full costs of renewable energy, including mining, transportation, investment, and building costs.

The paper suggests that energy policy should prioritize affordability, security of supply, and environmental protection.

        "text": "The United States increased its electricity generation from utility-scale solar power by nearly one-third in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. Despite that considerable increase in solar, the climate benefits of this growth were undermined by a rapid rise in electricity demand, which was met in large part by an increase in generation from fossil fuels. This week, the Energy Information Administration released electricity generation statistics for June, which allows for a close look at where we stand halfway through 2024. The numbers tell a story of a country moving in the right direction, but not nearly fast enough. Explore the latest news about what\u2019s at stake for the climate during this election season. First, the topline: Generation from utility-scale power plants was 2.1 million gigawatt-hours from January to June, an increase of 5 percent from January to June of 2023. That\u2019s the highest percentage increase in decades when comparing the first half of a year to the first half of the prior year. Grid planners and analysts have warned that the country is entering a period of rapid growth in electricity consumption to meet the needs of data centers, factories and other new construction. This follows a time of modest growth, which was due to a variety of factors, including the high efficiency of new lighting, appliances and building methods. Heat, including the second-hottest June on record, is also a major factor when assessing energy consumption this year. Rapid growth in electricity demand makes it harder for policymakers and energy companies to deal with climate change because it increases the size of the pool that new carbon-free electricity sources need to fill, and it hurts the economic case for shutting down fossil fuel power plants. That said, generation from carbon-free power sources grew significantly in the first half of 2024. Utility-scale solar plants generated 102,615 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 30 percent from the first half of 2023. Wind farms, both offshore and onshore, generated 247,434 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 8 percent. Generation from fossil fuels also grew. Natural gas power plants\u2014the country\u2019s largest source of electricity by a wide margin\u2014generated 857,023 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 5 percent. Coal-fired power plants generated 303,027 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 1 percent. Put another way, gas and coal increased by a combined 46,843 gigawatt-hours, and wind and solar increased by a combined 42,698 gigawatt-hours. That\u2019s pretty depressing, so I\u2019ll also note that the sum of increases in carbon-free sources, which includes nuclear, wind, solar and others, was 51,711 gigawatt-hours, and was more than the sum of the increases in gas and coal. The larger point is that the growth in generation from carbon-free electricity sources needs to far outpace fossil sources by a lot, and it isn\u2019t. So far this year, the country\u2019s power companies are building vastly more renewable energy power plants than other types. Of the 375 new generating units that came online so far this year, 243 were utility-scale solar farms; 75 were utility-scale battery systems, which often work in tandem with renewable energy; 17 were onshore wind farms and 1 was an offshore wind farm, South Fork Wind off of New York. (Figures are from EIA\u2019s power plant database, counting new generating units from January to July.) During the same period, 38 natural gas or petroleum-burning units went online, and one new nuclear unit went online, at the Vogtle plant in Georgia. There were zero new coal plants. The new units have 23,326 megawatts of capacity; 76 percent of this total comes from solar and batteries, and 95 percent comes from carbon-free sources (solar, batteries, onshore wind, offshore wind and nuclear). Texas led the country in new construction, with a heavy emphasis on solar. California ranked second and was the leader in batteries. This graphic from my colleague Paul Horn shows where new plants were built, which could be fodder for dozens of stories about what\u2019s driving investment on a state-by-state basis. The main caveat is that we\u2019re talking about just seven months of new plants, and some states may have significant activity right before or right after this period. It\u2019s going to take some time for the new units to have much of an effect on national electricity generation statistics. Some of the new units are only a month or two old and not yet fully operational. Also, the list includes units completed in July, which would mean none of their output is included in the generation figures, which cover the first half the year. I want to caution against exuberance about how much carbon-free resources are dominating new construction in this narrow timeframe. To cut carbon emissions to a meaningful extent, it\u2019s not enough for solar, wind and batteries to have a big lead in the number and capacity of new units. The lead needs to be gigantic and sustained over many years. And fossil electricity generation needs to fall, on a sustained basis, over many years. Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week: General Motors and Samsung SDI Finalize Team-Up Plans in Indiana: General Motors and Samsung SDI said they have reached a final agreement on a joint venture announced last year to open a battery manufacturing plant near South Bend, Indiana, as Heekyong Yang and David Shepardson report for Reuters. The plan includes a one-year delay in the plant\u2019s opening, which would now be in 2027, a sign that the companies may be expecting battery demand to grow more slowly than they had previously projected. Even if it takes an extra year to open, the $3.5 billion investment and 1,600 jobs are significant for Indiana. Tesla\u2019s Rivals Still Can\u2019t Use Its Superchargers: Last year, automakers coalesced around plans to allow most electric cars to be able to charge using Tesla\u2019s Supercharger network, which was hailed at the time as a step forward for U.S. charging infrastructure. But the network remains largely inaccessible to people who don\u2019t drive Teslas because of software delays and hardware shortages, as Jack Ewing reports for The New York Times. There is speculation that the delays may be partly due to Tesla CEO Elon Musk having second thoughts about opening up the network to help other automakers at a time when his company\u2019s vehicle sales have dropped. EV Manufacturing Is Coming to Kentucky, But Drivers and Dealers Slow to Move Away From Gas: The Louisville Courier Journal has published a series of stories examining how automakers are making large manufacturing investments in Kentucky and how the state\u2019s drivers and auto dealers feel about EVs at a time when they are about to become an important part of local economic growth. Ford and Toyota are the two major players in this wave of investment. States Use Carrots and Sticks to Deal With Opposition to Renewable Development: Some experts worry that recent laws in Illinois, Michigan and New York designed to help overcome local opposition to renewable energy development could help to intensify opposition, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. The state laws are part of a larger picture of state and local governments responding to a rise in objections to renewable energy projects that threaten to slow the shift away from fossil fuels. Swiss Solar Company Cancels Plans for Colorado Factory: Meyer Burger, a Swiss solar manufacturer, has scrapped plans to build a new factory in Colorado Springs that would have had more than 350 jobs, as Sam Brasch reports for Colorado Public Radio. The company said the decision was related to a Biden administration action this month on tariffs that allows for more imports of solar components from China and other Asian markets for use by companies making solar panels. Many solar companies praised the easing of tariffs, but Meyer Burger is among those that stood to lose because of low-cost competition with its planned factory.

Not only are solar panels a significant expense, but they also represent a commitment that can last decades. That\u2019s why this is not a decision that you should rush into. Instead, take the time to review the disadvantages of solar energy so that you can confidently make the decision that is right for you.

Beyond that, there are several other potentially negative factors you should consider before moving ahead. Many people consider solar panels because of the long-term savings potential. However, that comes with a steep upfront price: On average, residential solar panels cost $16,000\u2014with $3,500 on the low end and $35,000 on the high end. These costs depend on factors such as the amount of solar panels needed, the type of solar panels used and where you live. The cost of solar panels can vary significantly even within the continental United States. For example, the starting cost for a six-kW system in Wisconsin is $17,580 compared to a $13,101 starting cost for a comparable system in Tennessee. Currently, the federal government provides a 26% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for systems installed in 2022. However, that rate is set to dip to 22% for systems installed in 2023. Unless the credit is renewed, it is due to expire in 2024. If you\u2019re considering installing solar panels in a year or two from now, that means you may want to anticipate it costing even more. If you don\u2019t have funds available to pay for solar panels outright, there are numerous solar panel financing options available. The catch is that the average interest rate for loans like these is more than 6%, which means you will ultimately spend quite a bit more money while paying the interest. To determine how many solar panels you need, you\u2019ll first need to understand how much electricity your home uses on a monthly basis. Your personal sum should be listed on your utility bill as \u201ckWh used\u201d for one month\u2019s demand. If you are building a home and aren\u2019t sure of your energy demands, keep in mind that the average household needs 867 kilowatt-hours (kW/h) per month in electrical power. Once you know your kW/h number for the month, divide that by 30 to get a daily kW/h number. For example, if you use 900 kW/h per month, that translates to roughly 30 kW/h per day. As a rule of thumb, one solar panel generates one kW/h per day. So, for this example, you would need 30 solar panels on your home. This can be a disadvantage both because of cost and the logistical challenges presented by having so many solar panels on your roof. Solar panels can complicate home repairs\u2014especially if you need to repair the roof. That could result in an average expense of $2,500 to remove and reinstall solar panels. The best approach is to thoroughly repair and reinforce your roof before installing solar panels, although this too adds to the cost. Not surprisingly, solar panels rely on the sun. If your home doesn\u2019t receive a consistent amount of sunlight, this may not be the option for you. What is surprising is that even homes in seemingly sunny areas still may not be good candidates for solar energy: The biggest factor determining the potential efficacy of solar panels is the latitude at which a home is situated. For example, even if a home at a high latitude has mostly sunny weather, the overall effect for the year is that there are fewer hours of sunlight. Unless you are able to \u201cbank\u201d solar energy with a battery or buy-back program from your local utility company, homes up north may not get enough solar energy during darker winter months to sustain themselves independently. Even closer to the equator, homes in places that experience a lot of cloudy, rainy days may not get enough sunlight. The same goes for homes in densely shaded areas. If you are going off-grid, you will need to budget for solar batteries to bank the energy you get during the day for use overnight or during darker seasons. With installation, home batteries for solar panels cost roughly $10,000 to $20,000.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

This starts with the production process when greenhouse gasses are emitted while manufacturing solar panels. According to the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, it takes between one and four years to \u201cpayback\u201d the energy that was used to create the solar panel system. If you need to dispose of solar panels, it\u2019s not as simple as taking them to the landfill. Solar panels are made with substances such as cadmium and lead-acid, which are fine when they are contained within the panels. However, they are dangerous pollutants if allowed to leach into the ground. For that reason, you must plan to properly dispose of solar panels and there currently are not widespread recycling options. \n                Looking For Hassle-Free Solar Installation\n             Find a network of trusted installers for solar system, solar panels and electricity needs.

        "text": "Now Reading By Jenn Mullen, Contributor By Jenn Mullen, Contributor Published 04-03-24 Submitted by Keysight Technologies The Covid-19 pandemic heightened existing pressure points in nearly every sector and industry. The pandemic exacerbated the already crisis-level burnout that healthcare workers were struggling with. Hospital networks are struggling to keep pace with more patients requiring care from a shrinking healthcare professional workforce. Inflation, increased doctor-patient ratios, and a shrinking healthcare talent pool have stretched the medical industry to its breaking point. Even before the pandemic, hospital networks across the globe were investigating ways that digital healthcare technologies could improve access to healthcare, improve efficiency, and keep healthcare costs low. During the pandemic, the adoption of digital technologies accelerated and contributed to the resilience of healthcare systems during the challenges presented by the pandemic. Digital health technologies that leverage AI contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital systems in meaningful ways, including cost reductions, improved access to healthcare, and resource optimization. AI-enabled clinical decision-making support for healthcare workers Due to the healthcare talent shortages, practicing clinicians see more patients than ever before and must balance efficiency with quality of care. Because of their automation capabilities and abilities to learn from large volumes of patient data and medical research, AI-enabled healthcare technologies are playing an increasingly large role in improving physical decision making when it comes to diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care. Equally-- if not more-- importantly, are the benefits to clinicians. AI-powered clinical decision support can analyze patient data, medical literature, and the most recent best practices to provide physicians with evidence-based recommendations to diagnose, treat, and manage care for their growing number of patients. This allows clinicians to make better informed and far more personalized decisions regarding treatment planning and medication selection for patients. AI can also enable real-time alert automation to notify clinicians of critical findings, flag potential medication errors, and highlight missed opportunities for preventative care. These digital healthcare technologies can make a meaningful impact on morale and job satisfaction for medical workers. They help healthcare workers make well-informed decisions while also reducing cognitive burden in physicians, improve the practitioners\u2019 ability to see and treat more patients without sacrificing quality of care, and ensure better patient outcomes. AI applications for healthcare networks In healthcare, the delivery of timely care and treatment is very literally a life and death issue. Healthcare supply chains are intricate, massive machines comprised of various mechanisms that orchestrate the delivery of services needed to ensure patient care. These supply chains are far more complicated than others because they include people and are significantly impacted by the needs of individual patients. AI-supported technologies are improving the quality of care and efficiency of medical resources. AI applications for hospital networks can connect the different clinics, labs, and diagnostics to create a holistic view of the entire network, thus enabling improved coordination and communication between various channels. It can then perform predictive analysis of historical appointment data, demographics, and clinic capacities to forecast appointment demands with far greater accuracy. In turn, hospital managers can optimize resources and scheduling, resulting in shorter patient wait times. AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants are also helping hospital networks to run more smoothly by automating appointment scheduling, prescription refills, and billing inquiries. By reducing administrative burdens for healthcare staff, AI frees up time for healthcare workers to focus on patient care and clinical tasks. AI can perform routine, repetitive operational tasks and improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosing conditions like cancer much faster than humans. By reducing administrative burdens for healthcare staff, AI frees up time for healthcare workers to focus on patient care and clinical tasks while also making hospitals more cost-effective. Telemedicine and remote monitoring AI-enabled telehealth and remote monitoring capabilities increase access to healthcare, improve communication between healthcare providers, and improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of quality patient care. Artificial intelligence enables hospitals to share data and collaborate effectively on cases while preserving patient privacy. This facilitates more confidence in virtual consultations and enables more comprehensive care by allowing multi-disciplinary healthcare teams to coordinate patient care from different locations. Rural patients often travel long distances for medical appointments and diagnostics and will do so out of necessity. However, once they have resolved their acute medical issues, these patients may not return for follow-up visits. The proliferation of wearable health monitoring devices enables physicians to monitor patients and make real-time, data-driven medical decisions without requiring the patient to be on-site. AI and telemedicine are allowing practitioners to expand virtual care options throughout the treatment plan that can improve patient experience and their outcomes. Barriers to adoption of AI in medicine The benefits of AI-driven tools in healthcare are numerous, and their aid in building resilience is promising. However, there are many barriers to widespread adoption that device manufacturers and healthcare IT professionals must consider. Regulations, data privacy, interoperability, a lack of standardization, and resistance to change represent significant hurdles that must be considered. Building back a stronger, more resilient healthcare industry The post-pandemic world is increasingly relying on AI and automation to optimize resources and streamline operations. The healthcare sector has seen an explosion in technology that can aid practitioners in combatting burnout and optimize resources and operations in hospital networks.

        "text": "A recent survey conducted by Wolters Kluwer Health unveils insights into U.S. physicians' attitudes towards the integration of generative AI (GenAI) in healthcare. According to the findings, 40% of physicians are ready to utilize GenAI in patient interactions at the point of care within this year.  But more importantly, the survey indicates a notable shift in perception, with 68% of respondents stating a change in their views over the past year, now viewing GenAI as potentially beneficial for healthcare. Despite this growing acceptance, physicians express cautiousness regarding the types of GenAI tools they are willing to adopt. Most (91%) emphasize the importance of GenAI materials being developed by medical professionals, while 89% demand transparency from vendors regarding the sourcing and creation of information.Dr. Peter Bonis, Chief Medical Officer at Wolters Kluwer Health, highlights the significance of content source and transparency, emphasizing that physicians prioritize trustworthy applications of generative AI in clinical settings.\"Physicians are open to using generative AI in a clinical setting provided that applications are useful and trustworthy. The source of content and transparency are key considerations,\" Dr. Peter Bonis said in a press release statement.Physicians perceive GenAI as a transformative technology capable of addressing challenges such as staffing shortages and burnout in healthcare. They anticipate several advantages, including improved care team interactions with patients, time savings, and enhanced decision-making processes at the point of care.Contrastingly, a comparison between physician and consumer perspectives reveals disparities in views regarding the integration of GenAI. While two-thirds of physicians believe patients would trust GenAI results for clinical decisions, only slightly over half of patients share this sentiment. Moreover, physicians underestimate patient concerns regarding GenAI usage in diagnoses, highlighting a significant perception gap between healthcare providers and consumers.

Additionally, a majority of physicians believe that GenAI has the potential to yield time savings of 20% or more. Furthermore, over two-thirds  (68%) of physicians assert that GenAI can expedite the process of searching medical literature, facilitating efficient access to relevant information.Similarly, three in five physicians (59%) indicate that GenAI can streamline tasks by summarizing patient data extracted from electronic health records (EHR). Conversely, a small minority, comprising only 3% of physicians, believe that GenAI will not contribute to improving interactions with patients. The survey underscores the evolving landscape surrounding the adoption of GenAI, with many physicians indicating a lack of clear guidelines or policies within their organizations. Despite this, physicians emphasize the importance of transparency and content sourcing when selecting GenAI tools. Most prioritize tools trained on content developed by medical professionals, while transparency from vendors regarding data sourcing and technology origins is deemed essential. The survey involved 100 respondents who are U.S. physicians working in large hospitals and/or health systems, actively seeing patients, and utilizing clinical decision-support tools.

        "text": "Coming into 2024, we are truly in the midst of another AI hype cycle. As radiologists, my colleagues and I have become accustomed to claims that AI can solve the NHS\u2019s workforce crisis. The truth is that this technology is incredibly exciting, but do we need a reality check before the NHS gets too carried away by the promise of AI? In recent years, we have seen huge excitement about the potential for AI to replace radiologists, particularly in the context of the radiology workforce crisis. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has been calling for greater investment to grow the radiologist workforce for years, but these calls have been mostly brushed aside. The radiologist workforce grew by just 3% in 2022, whilst the RCR estimates that there is currently a 29% shortfall of clinical radiologists in the UK. (1) Attempts to increase the consultant radiologist workforce are underway, but improvements are simply not keeping up with demand. Last year, 44 million imaging tests were reported in England alone \u2013 an increase of 26% from the previous year. This huge pressure on radiology services not only means that patients are waiting longer for their scan results but also that there is an increased risk of reporting errors. Only 24% of clinical directors currently think that their radiology department has enough clinical radiologists to provide safe and effective patient care. (2) AI tools in the NHS for medical imaging are even more attractive because healthcare systems simply cannot function without radiology. Over 3.6 billion radiology exams are conducted globally each year, including 43 million in the UK alone. Every medical department relies on radiology to provide diagnoses; without a diagnosis, treatment is often impossible. We must also remember that AI technology isn\u2019t just an innovation for higher-income countries but could also be used to address the huge inequalities when accessing healthcare resources worldwide. This is perhaps where there could be most impact for patients. A lot of the technology and skills are concentrated in a small number of countries, but AI tools that help do things at scale will have a hugely important role in improving global access to healthcare. In June 2023, the UK Government announced a \u00a321m investment in AI tools in the NHS, with Trusts able to apply for funding through the AI Diagnostic Fund to help speed up diagnoses. This was incredibly welcome news to those working in chronically overstretched radiology departments, but was this putting the cart before the horse? Unfortunately, too many radiology departments still use paper-based or telephone-based systems, relying on siloed PACs (picture archiving and communications systems) and Radiology Information Systems (RIS), making it extremely difficult to review and share scans. Some hospitals even struggle to get a reliable wireless internet connection. I can\u2019t have been the only one to wonder whether digitising the NHS\u2019s diagnostic services to make them AI-ready would have been a better use of government funding. Instead, we\u2019re now in the slightly surreal position of having funding for AI tools in the NHS but not for the necessary digital infrastructure to support it. There are also huge benefits associated with digitising diagnostic services beyond supporting new AI tools. A 2023 NHS pilot at North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust (NWAFT), in collaboration with radiology company Hexarad, digitised on-call diagnostic services at two major hospitals, which resulted in increased clinical capacity and faster delivery of emergency diagnostic services. Early results from that pilot suggest that implementing the digital platform reduced vetting time by 84.3% (30 minutes to 4.7 minutes) and streamlined the management pathway of more than 8800 patients, aiding fast and accurate diagnosis. The time saved is estimated to be between 12 and 14 hours per night, the equivalent of one extra clinician per shift in a ten-doctor department. To achieve this same outcome, a hospital would need to spend \u00a3365,000 per annum on locum agency fees. Results like these demonstrate the huge benefits of digital transformation for NHS diagnostic services, while at the same time putting Trusts in a better position to embrace AI technology when it is ready for wider implementation. Like many radiologists, I see a future where radiology departments (not just radiologists) can work seamlessly with AI tools. A patient\u2019s radiology journey starts from the moment their doctor decides they need a scan, but several logistical steps need to happen before the scan results are ready. We spend a lot of time and resources on the most complex part of the pathway, namely interpreting the scan. However, AI and automation could streamline pathways such as patient booking or managing the supply and demand of both scanning and radiologist capacity. However, the promise of AI shouldn\u2019t close our eyes to the reality of the state of radiology in the NHS right now. In many places, the digital infrastructure isn\u2019t there to allow AI tools in the NHS to work. We need to make sure that the solutions being developed and funded truly address our most pressing problems. Sometimes, those problems will be diagnostic, but often, streamlining workflow or data collection can be just as effective. Technology cannot fix a broken process. It feels like we\u2019re on another upward curve in AI at the moment, where the enthusiasm and excitement at the prospect of an \u2018easy fix\u2019 for the NHS are at an all-time high. Recent discussions about AI have done little to temper this in the popular imagination. Still, we must hope that NHS leadership can see that digital transformation, including AI, is what will make the biggest impact on improving diagnostic services. Innovation very rarely follows a constant upward trend. There will certainly be a future for AI in healthcare, but it might not be quite the one we expect.

        "text": "AI is proving to be a broadly transformative technology, applied across every industry. Without a doubt the healthcare industry grapples with the best way to apply AI to deliver results and quality to patients, care providers, support staff, and all aspects of the industry. At the recent 2024 SXSW Conference and Festivals that took place in March 2024, Dr. Jag Singh, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, focusing on the application of AI in the practice of medicine, and practicing cardiologist at Mass General Brigham (MGB) spoke on the topic of \u201cRethinking and Reinventing Medicine\u201d. In a followup interview on the AI Today podcast, Dr. Jag Singh expanded on his talk, and shares additional insights for this article. Q: Healthcare was a big theme at the 2024 SXSW Conference and Festivals. What do you see as the hot topics in the industry today? Dr. Jag Singh: Most recently, I wrote a book called \u201cFuture Care Sensors, AI, and the Reinvention of Medicine\u201d, which was a focus of my talk at the 2024 SXSW Conference. Let\u2019s take a step back and really lay the ground for why AI is so important in healthcare. Part of it is because healthcare as we understand it is pretty much unsustainable the way it is. It's what we call, \u201cbig, fat and sick\u201d and it requires resuscitation. Part of that problem is because we're nontransparent. We're very opaque in the way we reimburse health care and in the way we practice health care. Just to give you an example, 20% of our GDP in the US, about $4 trillion, goes towards healthcare. And we're still indefensible on most of the care quality metrics. Those care quality metrics are relevant to the question of the AI perspective. Also we're a living contradiction here in the US, because 3 out of 4 dollars are spent in looking after patients with chronic diseases. Over and above and beyond that, the wellness of our institutions is dependent on the sickness of our patients. That is where AI can help us flip that conversation. Now, with unlimited connectivity, and ubiquitous data and massive processing power, we are uniquely poised now to actually transform the way we deliver care. The future of care is largely going to be virtual, with sensors, with AI, in sustainable workflows that will translate into better outcomes. I look at it specifically as analytic AI, which is conventional AI and generative AI, because of how we're actually looking after patients and even physicians. AI clearly has a role in predicting disease, whether it's cancer or heart disease or any other disease state. But most importantly, I think the only way that healthcare can become sustainable is to introduce self management strategies where patients can have more skin in the game. AI will empower patients to play a role also in managing their own diseases, or what I call as MYOD, manage your own disease. As a simple example can be seen with diabetes. You have a sensor that can measure blood glucose level that is connected to your insulin pump, that using AI based approaches can adjust your insulin dose. So there are feedback loops using AI and sensor based approaches already in small situations in single disease states being put into play. As you can only imagine that as we talk about complex diseases, this is going to have a significant way in actually impacting personalized care. Q: How do you see wearables and sensors tying into the use of AI in healthcare? Dr. Jag Singh: All of us experienced during COVID as we tried to stay away from the hospitals, that we still wanted to get the care we needed to get. Telehealth, or virtual care, now is a common terminology, but an umbrella terminology. The pendulum, unfortunately, has swung back a little bit because of regulatory issues. Out-of-state virtual care, where you actually need to do out-o-state virtual care in rural areas, is not that easily amenable or reimbursable. Much of that is going to come back because patients are going to expect them. And I think patient expectations are going to trump regulatory issues in the near future, because also that's the only way you can eventually access care. If we're talking about all the social determinants of health and the inequity of care, virtual care is probably the first step in actually giving patients access and also at the same time declutter the busy outpatient areas of large academic and tertiary centers where a lot of these things can be done virtually. But I think virtual care or a video based care visit is actually just a highly glorified, sophisticated phone call where you're actually seeing the patient, and that's where you need sensors. You need sensors to provide us with objective data, as if you're actually interacting or interfacing with the patient in the clinic room, where you have objective data to make that assessment. And that's where sensors really make an important part of clinical practice. There are implantable sensors and there are wearable sensors. Whether they're watches, whether they're necklaces, whether they're rings, whether they're tattoo sensors, ambient sensors, sensors on the walls that can check our gait or stability. There are sensors on the toilet seats now that can actually measure your weight, record your ECG, and study your microbiome, so they really provide you with objective evidence that is oftentimes missing in a routine clinical visit. At the same time, they really allow for individualized care. I think that's where medicine is eventually going is through virtual care and through sensor aided technology. Q: What are you working on or implementing today at Mass General Brigham and in research? Dr. Jag Singh: We already have at Mass General Brigham (MGB) AI chatbots and we're experimenting with how they can respond in a very empathetic way to patient queries regarding their data or certain questions. It can construct an approach that relieves the burden on the clinicians. The second place we're implementing AI at MGB, is to have ambient note technologies where you actually walk into the clinic, you talk to the patient, and your electronic medical record has a note that is generated from your conversation, which is a proper clinic note. This will really reduce the burnout and reduce the burden on clinicians by liberation from keyboards, and at the same time unchaining us from the mundane activities like prescription writing and pre-authorizations and things to that effect. There's already an impact of AI in places like pathology and radiology with computer vision. The machine sees a lot of things better than human eyes can, and actually helps categorize risk and classify risk better than we can. That's a place which is a low hanging fruit. Additionally, we already have AI based strategies that are becoming a part of clinical practice. There are single disease states such as diabetes or chronic obstructive lung disease, where you have a sensor and you have an AI based approach and algorithm to manage those patients. In the long term, how can you continue to aggregate continuous data? How can you put AI logic into it to provide that hyperpersonalized care? I think this is where we're all going towards to enhance the level of digital equity and thereby global health equity, to democratize the delivery of care all across the world. And I think if there's anything that can do it, it's this whole burgeoning digital metamorphosis, this whole sensor AI union of providing care.

The first two reports are in The Press issues of May 12, 2023, and Oct. 26, 2023. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The Economist cover story in its March 30, 2024 edition has this to say about artificial intelligence:\u00a0 \u201c\u2026in the field of health care, it has the potential to be transformational. In Europe analysts predict that deploying AI could save hundreds of thousands of lives each year.\u201d\u00a0 In America, it is estimated AI has the potential to \u201cshave $200bn-$360bn from annual medical spending.\u201d That would be a huge savings, as the United States spends $4.5tn a year on health care, 17 percent of its GNP. Many health institutions report they are using, or planning to use AI to: (a) enhance diagnostic accuracy, (b) improve disease tracking, (c) improve predictions of patients\u2019 outcome, (d) recommend better treatments, (e) reduce time for drugs to reach clinical trials, and others.\u00a0 The health care industry is short-staffed. It is predicted by AI/health care experts that AI will lead to more tasks being off-loaded to computers, thereby reducing the need for certain health care workers. It is estimated if present trends continue, by 2030 the industry will be short of 10 million workers.\u00a0 The stated goals of health care are to first improve care with reducing costs being second. Improved care costs more money and as technology continues to improve, that translates into even more expensive treatments. AI is viewed by some of its supporters as a financial and medical godsend to the health care industry. \u2026And other industries as well.\u00a0 However, this writer has documented in the two previous articles of problems with the technology.\u00a0 First, AI does not always produce accurate information. Second, in some AI systems, its creators do not understand how the AI software/hardware produces this information. This serious problem is known by two names: hallucinating or confabulating. Stated another way, one AI expert said the technology sometimes \u201cmakes things up.\u201d I am far from being an expert on artificial intelligence. I have studied it and examined how the technology works, but much of it remains a mystery to me. But it also is a mystery to some who work in the AI field.\u00a0 AI skeptics have stated, \u201cThe AI models\u2026do not always respond in the same way to the same stimulus. \u2026This raises philosophical and practical problems for those who [use AI] to regulate medical devices.\u201d Of course, other devices as well, such as missile launchers or robots performing surgeries. \u00a0 While this writer does not claim to be AI-literate, he is well experienced as a medical patient. I am uneasy that I may be faced with having an instrument inserted in my chest to monitor or control heart conditions when that device, if AI driven, might make errors in keeping me alive.\u00a0 Perhaps I am overreacting, and I have learned that certain AI systems hallucinate more than others. I\u2019m told that the field of artificial intelligence is relatively new, and it will continue to be fine-tuned to eventually be much less likely to hallucinate. \u00a0 Maybe so, and I do not want to come across as a technology Luddite. From what I gather in today\u2019s systems, AI obtains its information and feeds output to humans through mathematics and probability calculations. In essence, \u201cThe fundamental problem is that language models [the prevalent AI systems use today] are probabilistic, while truth is not.\u201d\u00a0 Naysayers claim the AI systems that are built on probability theory (chance variations) \u201cwill never be completely rid of hallucinations.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 As it stands now, I do not want AI machines inserted into my chest to control my afib. And I hope we all agree that we do not want \u2014 at this stage of the technology \u2014 to have AI robots doing gene splicing or launching missiles.\u00a0 On the other side of the coin, AI is proving to be able to solve complex problems involving millions of pieces of information that are far beyond humans\u2019 cognitive powers. \u201cDennis Hassabis, one of the founders of DeepMind, an AI power house that is now part of Google, thinks that [AI] will change the way humans understand life itself.\u201d AI is growing at a phenomenal rate. Money is to be made in AI investments \u2014 a lot of money.

        "summary": "The Economist reports that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives in healthcare each year in Europe. In the US, AI could reduce annual medical spending by $200-$360 billion. Many health institutions are using or planning to use AI to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve disease tracking, and recommend better treatments. However, the healthcare industry is facing a shortage of workers, with a predicted deficit of 10 million workers by 2030. AI may help alleviate this shortage by offloading tasks to computers. Despite its potential benefits, AI is not without problems, including producing inaccurate information and \"hallucinating\" or making things up. This is a serious concern, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical devices and missile launchers. The author, who is not an AI expert but has experience as a medical patient, is uneasy about relying on AI-driven devices for his care. While AI has the potential to solve complex problems, its limitations and potential for error must be acknowledged. The author urges caution in the development and deployment of AI technology."

Here\u2019s how it works.\n With pressure increasing on healthcare systems globally and many countries still struggling to clear the backlog from the pandemic, Microsoft believes AI holds the key to addressing both administrative burdens and improving the clinician-patient experience. A new study from the company of 13,500 patients across 11 countries, including 2,000 from the UK, found patients are prepared to let AI handle some of their clinicians' work to free up more interpersonal time, seeing it as a natural progression of existing digitalization efforts. Currently, two in five (39%) UK respondents are concerned that their doctor does not give them their full attention during treatment, thanks to the computer-based administrative work that goes hand-in-hand with consultations. From the patient\u2019s point of view, artificial intelligence is simply an extension of existing systems. Half of the UK participants in Microsoft\u2019s study already have access to private or health insurance-provided online platforms where documents and prescriptions are shared. For the clinician, an injection of AI represents a considerable time saving \u2013\u00a0the extra hours typically put in by a doctor to tackle medical documentation have fuelled widespread job dissatisfaction and burnout. Dr Simon Wallace, Chief Clinical Information Office at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences UK, highlighted the significant effect that AI could have on patient care: \u201cThe role of digital technology is to support the clinician to return to the art of practicing medicine and give back time both for patients and their personal well-being.\u201d Mr Markus Vogel, Chief Medical Information Officer for Microsoft, commented on AI\u2019s role in personalizing healthcare for patients: \u201cWith automated processes and patient-driven chatbots providing assistance, AI becomes a catalyst for enhanced participation, language translation and personalized treatment modalities.\u201d Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!

Looking forward, it\u2019s clear that time-saving technologies like artificial intelligence and automation play a pivotal part in how nations address some of the most pressing social issues, and Microsoft\u2019s findings regarding public sentiment surrounding the technology spell out a pretty positive outlook. As for the challenges, industry experts have expressed concerns that practitioners may not be so keen to adapt to yet another new technology. However, speaking about the clinician-led nature of NHS England, National Digital Primary Care Nurse Lead Helen Crowther affirmed: \u201cIf you give us a new product and tell us that it\u2019s going to transform and change our lives for ourselves, colleagues, and patients, we\u2019re more than happy to adapt to it.\u201d As healthcare and artificial intelligence become increasingly entwined, Crowther noted the importance of involving nurses at all levels of digital transformation in order to ensure that they are clinically focused from concept.

The other risks are based around financial performance, competition, \u00a0workforce and cybersecurity, with AI and new technologies affecting most of those categories, according to the report. The efficiencies gained from AI tools must be weighed against the costs of implementing AI and training employees to use the tools properly to gauge the overall impact on financial performance. The benefits of AI can only be realized if the organization can solve the workforce challenges of recruiting employees with the right skills to manage these tools and their attendant risks, and training employees to use them. AI automation also could increase turnover as employees without the necessary skills to use these tools leave the organization, raising legal, reputational and cultural risks. The top management risks were identified through interviews with executive leaders and board members at health systems in the United States and risk assessments conducted at hundreds of hospitals, health systems, medical practices and other provider organizations. Kodiak defined risk as anything impeding a healthcare organization's ability to achieve its goals in critical areas like patient care, regulatory compliance, operations, strategic growth and financial performance. WHY THIS MATTERS Hospitals and medical practices face increasingly complex and interconnected risks that affect decision-making in clinical, operational and financial matters, according to the annual report on the top management risks for healthcare.\u00a0 AI tools, especially those based on generative AI models, promise benefits such as: Efficiency through automation; faster, more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions; and enhancing the consumer experience.

        "text": "State-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems known as large language models (LLMs) are poor medical coders, according to researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their study, published in the April 19 online issue of NEJM AI [DOI: 10.1056/AIdbp2300040], emphasizes the necessity for refinement and validation of these technologies before considering clinical implementation. The study extracted a list of more than 27,000 unique diagnosis and procedure codes from 12 months of routine care in the Mount Sinai Health System, while excluding identifiable patient data. Using the description for each code, the researchers prompted models from OpenAI, Google, and Meta to output the most accurate medical codes. The generated codes were compared with the original codes and errors were analyzed for any patterns. The investigators reported that all of the studied large language models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini-pro, and Llama-2-70b, showed limited accuracy (below 50 percent) in reproducing the original medical codes, highlighting a significant gap in their usefulness for medical coding. GPT-4 demonstrated the best performance, with the highest exact match rates for ICD-9-CM (45.9 percent), ICD-10-CM (33.9 percent), and CPT codes (49.8 percent). GPT-4 also produced the highest proportion of incorrectly generated codes that still conveyed the correct meaning. For example, when given the ICD-9-CM description \"nodular prostate without urinary obstruction,\" GPT-4 generated a code for \"nodular prostate,\" showcasing its comparatively nuanced understanding of medical terminology. However, even considering these technically correct codes, an unacceptably large number of errors remained. The next best-performing model, GPT-3.5, had the\u00a0greatest tendency toward being vague.\u00a0It had the highest proportion of incorrectly generated codes that were accurate but more general in nature compared to the precise codes. In this case, when provided with the ICD-9-CM description \"unspecified adverse effect of anesthesia,\" GPT-3.5 generated a code for \"other specified adverse effects, not elsewhere classified.\" Our findings underscore the critical need for rigorous evaluation and refinement before deploying AI technologies in sensitive operational areas like medical coding. While AI holds great potential, it must be approached with caution and ongoing development to ensure its reliability and efficacy in health care.\" Ali Soroush, MD, MS, Study Corresponding author, Assistant Professor of Data-Driven and Digital Medicine (D3M), and Medicine (Gastroenterology), at Icahn Mount Sinai One potential application for these models in the health care industry, say the investigators, is automating the assignment of medical codes for reimbursement and research purposes based on clinical text. \"Previous studies indicate that newer large language models struggle with numerical tasks. However, the extent of their accuracy in assigning medical codes from clinical text had not been thoroughly investigated across different models,\" says co-senior author Eyal Klang, MD, Director of the D3M's Generative AI Research Program. \"Therefore, our aim was to assess whether these models could effectively perform the fundamental task of matching a medical code to its corresponding official text description.\" The study authors proposed that integrating LLMs with expert knowledge could automate medical code extraction, potentially enhancing billing accuracy and reducing administrative costs in health care. \"This study sheds light on the current capabilities and challenges of AI in health care, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and additional refinement prior to widespread adoption,\" says co-senior author Girish Nadkarni, MD, MPH, Irene and Dr. Arthur M. Fishberg Professor of Medicine at Icahn Mount Sinai, Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine, and System Chief of D3M. The researchers caution that the study's artificial task may not fully represent real-world scenarios where LLM performance could be worse. Next, the research team plans to develop tailored LLM tools for accurate medical data extraction and billing code assignment, aiming to improve quality and efficiency in health care operations.

A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers. \n        Verified by Psychology Today \n                                    Posted April 8, 2024\n\n|\n\n\nReviewed by Monica Vilhauer Ph.D.\n\n\n The perception of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare is often that it exists in a background role, like in scheduling appointments or billing, with no direct interaction with patients. However, as technologies progress, more opportunities exist to leverage AI into something more than just a \"back-of-house\" tool with supporting functions. This article will focus on this \"front-of-house\" AI. Many people, possibly influenced by sci-fi movies or watching automated robots on social media platforms, are wary of patient-facing AI in healthcare. They believe it will displace human interaction or undermine employment opportunities for trained mental health professionals. This belief couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. AI, in the right hands, can actually enhance humanity within healthcare. By interacting directly with patients, reaching underserved communities, and performing much of the heavy lifting for mental health providers, AI allows clinicians to focus more time on the fundamentally human aspects of care delivery.  After an initial clinical assessment session (lasting anywhere from 1 to 2 hours), a typical psychotherapy session lasts around one hour, with a single therapist able to see seven to eight patients per day. Assuming the patient shows up (with studies showing the rate of missed appointments at over 40%) [1], they spend time in session sharing an update on what has happened since their last visit, talking through their experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Through structured conversation, the clinician\u2019s job is to continuously assess the patient\u2019s issues, relate this to the clinical literature and contextual knowledge, update the treatment plan if necessary, and ensure the patient is well-equipped to advance through the treatment steps, identifying potential barriers. That\u2019s a lot to get done in one hour! What if a well-trained AI agent could take on some of the burden? Large language models like ChatGPT have shown us that AI can hold highly naturalistic structured conversations with a human user. It stands to reason that clinically validated AI could work with the patient between sessions, gathering critical information, monitoring progress, ensuring treatment adherence and session attendance, and monitoring for signs of clinical risk or deterioration. By the time the patient next sees their therapist, the therapist can have already received a succinct clinical note with a comprehensive summary of the patient\u2019s progress since the last session.  Rather than draining humanity from therapy, AI will flood the system with more time. A one-hour session could be spent focusing on building a real human connection between the therapist and the patient\u2014empathy, active listening, relationship-building, trust, and expectation management. This blended approach to care would retain the clinical expertise of qualified therapists, relaying information more effectively and efficiently between provider and patient. While the skeptic would be forgiven for thinking patients might refuse to work with an AI agent, the research tells a different story. For example, a recent study showed that patients were more likely to refer themselves to care if they were greeted by an AI [2], citing personalization, empathy, and customized clinical interfacing as greatly impacting the patient\u2019s positive experience.  AI holds the potential to improve the user\u2019s experience and onboarding into health systems while reducing the stigma of mental health by offering a fundamentally nonjudgmental point of entry. Fascinating was the fact that minority groups benefited most from this technology, demonstrating the potential of digital tools to improve access for underserved communities. Unfortunately, burnout is a significant problem for psychotherapists, which became especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the American Psychological Association, almost 50% of psychologists believe that they cannot meet the treatment demand from patients and have an overwhelming feeling of being burned out [3]. Psychotherapists have become so overburdened with such poor work-life balance that many have decided to leave the industry. While most are still passionate about helping people, these providers cannot continue due to the incredible stressors they are facing.  To curb this challenge and increase industry retention, mental health providers can use patient-facing AI to do much of the heavy lifting, freeing them up to tackle only those tasks that require a true human expert. This will allow therapists to take on more of a clinical supervisor role and operate at the very top of their capabilities without feeling overwhelmed. It\u2019s indisputable that humans connect intricately through technology, from mobile phones and tablets to laptops. Society has evolved in tandem with technology. Just as the wider healthcare system benefitted from the inventions of medical imaging, genomic data, or even 3D printing prosthetics, implants, and replacement joints, walling off mental healthcare to AI and machine learning would isolate our industry and ignore a foundational piece of the human experience of the very people we aim to help. AI technology in the mental healthcare sector is representative of the journey from steam to diesel engines in the locomotive sector (or, better yet, the advancement from diesel to battery-powered vehicles) [4]. AI promises to usher in a desperately needed paradigm shift to an industry that still operates solely on overstretched human labor.  We must not allow providers or patients to be left behind. We must embrace these new approaches and guide them towards the betterment of humanity.

A typical psychotherapy session is limited to one hour, leaving clinicians with a heavy workload to assess patients, update treatment plans, and ensure progress. AI can take on some of this burden, gathering information and monitoring progress between sessions. This would allow therapists to focus on building a human connection with patients during sessions. Research shows that patients are open to working with AI agents, citing personalization and empathy as benefits. AI can improve the user experience, reduce stigma, and increase access for underserved communities. Burnout is a significant problem for psychotherapists, with almost 50% feeling overwhelmed and unable to meet treatment demand. AI can help curb this challenge by taking on tasks that don't require human expertise, freeing up therapists to work at the top of their capabilities. Embracing AI in mental healthcare can bring about a much-needed paradigm shift and improve the industry's ability to provide care."

Clinicians need workflow-enhancing solutions to manage growing workloads amidst staff shortages and help to deliver consistency and speed time to diagnosis and treatment, all while enhancing patient outcomes.\u00a0   As part of a framework agreement with Philips, Norwegian healthcare provider Vestre Viken Health Trust uses Philips AI Manager, a cloud-based AI-enabled clinical applications platform. The large-scale deployment includes an AI-based bone fracture radiology application that will serve the needs of around half a million people across 22 Norwegian municipalities. Over a 4-year term with possible extension, the agreement has the potential to deliver clinical AI solutions to around 3.8 million people (70% of the Norwegian population) at 30 hospitals across the country\u2019s four major regional healthcare authorities. It represents the largest and most comprehensive agreement for Philips to deploy enterprise-wide AI across a healthcare system in Europe.  \u201cApplying Artificial Intelligence in our Radiology Department has surpassed our expectations. Besides improving patient flows, and quality of care to our patients, we have found that AI even finds fractures that doctors overlooked\u201d, said Cecilie B. L\u00f8ken, Technology Director at Vestre Viken Health Trust. \u201cAI will become a central input factor in the healthcare services of the future, to drive efficient and good patient care.\u201d    Vestre Viken Health Trust\u2019s radiologists spend most of their scan viewing time just to determine there is no fracture. That time can be used on diagnosing more subtle fractures where a radiologist\u2019s experience and expertise are essential. For patients admitted to its emergency departments with suspected bone fractures, AI can reduce waiting time. Patients receive the benefits of a faster diagnosis, while radiologists benefit from a less stressful and more rewarding working environment.  \u201cThere is a pressing need to ease the burden on radiologists. By incorporating AI into our clinical applications and expanding access to third-party AI with an end-to-end platform, we help radiologists to be faster and more efficient, reducing routine work and offering advanced diagnostic support, leading to better clinical outcomes and patient care,\u201d said Martijn Hartjes, Business Leader Clinical Informatics at Philips.     The AI application initially deployed by Philips at Vestre Viken Health Trust hospitals automatically identifies radiography scans in which there is no immediate evidence of a fracture, so that radiologists can focus on more complex, difficult, and urgent cases. In all cases, radiologists can accept or reject the results before sending them to the hospital PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System). Expanding upon AI applications of Advanced Visualization Workspace, Philips AI Manager enables integrated access to third-party AI algorithms [1]. The application fits seamlessly into Vestre Viken hospitals\u2019 existing radiology workflow, automatically routing medical images and other data to selected AI applications and returning the results to accelerate diagnosis and treatment. AI applications for radiology, cardiology, and neuroradiology are accessible to radiology through the Philips AI Manager platform.     Philips AI Manager expands Philips clinical applications for radiology which include image processing, intelligent algorithms, advanced visualization and AI to help radiologists overcome the difficulties posed by high-volume workloads to analyze both routine and complex cases with efficiency and precision. In addition to AI applications integrated directly into Philips systems and clinical applications, there are numerous third-party AI applications available in the market that bring benefits to radiology departments. Philips AI Manager is a cloud-based solution that offers radiology departments access to a broad range of AI applications from multiple vendors. Available in the ecosystem of Blackford, it can assist with the diagnostic reading of images and easily implement multi-vendor AI into their workflows.

These challenges are compounded by limited resources and overstretched staff that results in protracted patient wait times and generic treatment strategies. Staff can operate with a surface level view of patient data, relying on basic medical histories and recent test results. This lack of comprehensive data interferes with their ability to fully understand patient needs and compromises the accuracy and individualisation of diagnoses and treatments. Such a healthcare approach, characterised by these limitations and engagements, could aptly be termed \u201cshallow medicine\u201d. The American cardiologist and scientist Eric Topol introduced the concept of \u201cdeep medicine\u201d in his 2019 book Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again. He critiques the US\u2019s shallow medicine model, offering insights from his clinical and personal experiences. Deep medicine holds the potential to revolutionise medical diagnostics, the effectiveness of treatments, and operational considerations. Topol presents artificial intelligence (AI) as the transformative solution to these systemic shallow issues. He outlines what he calls the deep medicine framework as a comprehensive strategy for the incorporation of AI into different aspects of healthcare. The framework of deep medicine is built upon three core pillars: deep phenotyping, deep learning and deep empathy. These pillars are all interconnected and adopting this framework could enhance patient care, support healthcare staff and strengthen the entire NHS system. Deep phenotyping Deep phenotyping refers to a comprehensive picture of an individual\u2019s health data, across a full lifetime. A deep phenotype goes far beyond the limited data collected during a standard medical appointment or health episode. It includes things such as a person\u2019s genetic code, the entirety of an individual\u2019s DNA, and information about the body\u2019s microbes or microbiome. It encompasses what\u2019s known as the \u201cexposome\u201d, the things in the environment that a person is exposed to during life, such as air pollution. It includes markers that reveal details of the metabolic processes going on in a person\u2019s body and the proteins their body is expressing, as well as other biological measures and metrics. It comprises a person\u2019s electronic health records, including their medical history, diagnoses, treatments and lab results. Deep learning The philosophy underpinning deep phenotyping is to combine this diverse data to enable more accurate and speedy diagnoses, precise and effective treatments, and to advance predictive and preventative medicine strategies. However, the sheer volume and complexity of the collected data pose significant challenges for analysing it all. This is where deep learning \u2013 an area of AI that seeks to simulate the decision-making power of the human brain \u2013 is so valuable. Deep learning uses an algorithm called a neural network that uses computers that are connected to one another to share information, a bit like nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain.  AI could potentially improve how diagnostic tools are used. Elif Bayraktar / Shutterstock Advances in neural network algorithms, technology, and availability of digital data have enabled neural networks to demonstrate impressive performance. For instance, they have enabled the rapid and accurate analysis of medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs. They can generate reports and predict disease progression and outcomes for the patient. AI is proving valuable in drug discovery and the identification of chemical markers from the body, such as those that can signal the presence of cancer. They can control instruments used in robotic surgery. In addition, AI technology like that behind ChatGPT can process medical literature and patient records to help make complex diagnoses. They can automate writing tasks, such as note taking and data entry. Deep empathy Integrating AI systems could help streamline operational tasks in health services like the NHS. These include bed management and hospital workflows. However, the development of AI technologies should not be haphazard \u2013 rather it needs to be targeted at real clinical needs and designed to foster better relations between patients and staff. This is the pillar of deep medicine known as deep empathy. Healthcare has increasingly become a discipline where the human touch, once its cornerstone, is overshadowed by a relentless pursuit of efficiency. Healthcare staff face an increased burden of administrative tasks. This can reduce the time they devote to each patient, eroding the essence and potential benefits of compassionate care. Staff need the sensitivity and time to respond to the emotional and psychological needs of patients and their families. This nurtures a supportive and compassionate care environment, and strengthens the human connection at the heart of healthcare. AI solutions can be designed to reduce the administrative burdens for staff, opening up more opportunities for meaningful patient interaction. By removing these barriers, we allow for a greater focus on direct patient care, helping improve the quality of the service provided and, hopefully, patient satisfaction. There is also a transformative opportunity to rethink efficiency, putting relationships between patients and staff at the core. It envisions a future where healthcare staff excel in both technical skill and emotional intelligence, enabling them to meet the psychological needs of patients with genuine understanding and compassion.

        "summary": "The healthcare system faces challenges such as short consultations, misdiagnosis, and delayed care due to limited resources and overstretched staff. This \"shallow medicine\" approach relies on basic medical histories and recent test results, compromising the accuracy and individualization of diagnoses and treatments. Eric Topol's concept of \"deep medicine\" proposes using artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionize medical diagnostics, treatment effectiveness, and operational considerations. The deep medicine framework consists of three pillars: deep phenotyping, deep learning, and deep empathy. Deep phenotyping involves collecting comprehensive health data, including genetic codes, microbiome, and environmental exposure. Deep learning uses neural networks to analyze this data, enabling accurate and speedy diagnoses, precise treatments, and predictive medicine. AI can also improve diagnostic tools, drug discovery, and robotic surgery, and automate tasks like note-taking and data entry. The deep empathy pillar focuses on designing AI systems that foster better patient-staff relationships, reducing administrative burdens and increasing time for compassionate care. By adopting the deep medicine framework, the NHS can enhance patient care, support healthcare staff, and strengthen the entire system. This approach has the potential to transform the healthcare industry, making it more human-centered and effective."

        "text": "AI is transforming elder care by augmenting resources and providing tools to improve quality. In the twilight years of life, when the pace slows down and the simple acts of daily living become challenging, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a powerful ally. It's a testament to how technology, often criticized for distancing human connections, can bring us closer, making the golden years not just bearable but joyful and dignified. Let us delve into the heartwarming journey of AI's role in elder care, showcasing real examples of its impact and the promise it holds for a future where aging is embraced with grace and support.  Imagine a world where the elderly, who might spend hours or days without human contact, have a companion that listens, learns, and interacts with them, keeping loneliness at bay. AI powered robots and virtual assistants are already turning this vision into reality. These companions can converse, remind seniors about medications, and alert them to upcoming appointments, making daily life safer and more enjoyable. For instance, consider the story of ElliQ, the AI companion designed specifically for the elderly. ElliQ offers conversation, entertainment, and reminders for health-related tasks, proving that technology can offer companionship and practical assistance. Its proactive interaction model is designed to keep the elderly engaged, promoting a healthier, more active lifestyle.  One of the most groundbreaking applications of AI in elder care is health monitoring and predictive care. Wearable devices and home sensors can now track vital signs, detect falls, and predict health issues before they become emergencies. This technology is not about invasive surveillance but about empowering seniors with autonomy while ensuring help is always within reach. For example, CarePredict is a wearable device that learns the daily patterns of its wearers. It alerts caregivers to deviations from these patterns, which might indicate health issues or falls. This early detection system is invaluable, potentially saving lives by ensuring timely medical intervention. AI tools are extending opportunities to support elder care needs. AI's ability to process and analyze huge data sets has opened new frontiers in personalized care. Machine learning algorithms now tailor health and wellness plans for individuals, considering their unique health histories, preferences, and needs. This customization ensures that the care provided is not just adequate but optimal. A shining example is the use of AI in managing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Platforms like MindMate use games and activities designed to boost cognitive function, while AI algorithms track progress and adjust the difficulty levels, offering a personalized brain health regimen.  Smart home technology, infused with AI, enables seniors to maintain their independence while ensuring their safety. Automated lighting, voice-activated devices, and smart thermostats can make living alone less daunting for the elderly, reducing the risk of accidents and improving their quality of life. Moreover, AI-driven platforms like Intuition Robotics integrate these smart home features with companion robots, creating an ecosystem that supports seniors in living independently, securely, and comfortably.  AI also breaks down the barriers of distance and isolation by making communication easier and more accessible for the elderly. Video call apps and platforms have integrated AI to simplify interfaces and enhance the user experience, enabling seniors to stay in touch with their loved ones with ease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when isolation became a significant issue for the elderly, AI communication tools were a lifeline, providing not just a window to the outside world but a bridge to the hearts of their families and friends. AI will be the future in elder care assistance. Our journey to integrate AI into elder care is only just beginning. With each advancement, we're not only pushing the boundaries of what's possible but also redefining what it means to age in today's world. The potential of AI to transform elder care is immense, promising a future where the elderly are not left behind but are supported to live their best lives. As we look forward, AI is more than just a tool for care. It is a partner in creating a world that cherishes its elders, offering them the respect, care, and joy they deserve. The golden years can truly shine, illuminated by the promise of AI, ensuring that as we age, we do not fade into the shadows but continue to live brightly, supported by technology that cares. That\u2019s why AI in elder care is a halo of hope, showing the path to a future where aging is not a journey of isolation and vulnerability but one of dignity, independence, and connection. Through solutions like ElliQ, CarePredict, MindMate, and Intuition Robotics, we see the tangible benefits of AI in enhancing the lives of the elderly. As we continue to innovate and integrate AI into elder care, we do so with a commitment to ethical principles, ensuring that technology serves as a bridge to better care, deeper connections, and a more inclusive society. The future of elder care, powered by AI, is not just about adding years to life but adding life to years, making every moment count.  One Community.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly part of life, and so are anxieties about how it will change life as we know it. How it will change our jobs is just one aspect of the dystopian future we imagine it is creating. Some, if not many, of these concerns warrant serious consideration, but you don\u2019t need to be wearing rose-tinted glasses to see that AI also holds immense potential to improve our lives, particularly in healthcare. AI\u2019s powerful image-processing capabilities are already helping healthcare professionals to detect serious diseases early by accurately analysing medical images. For example, AI algorithms significantly help radiologists spot malignant tumours, and in emergency rooms, some medical facilities use AI to spot embolisms and signs of stroke, which is crucial for minimising the risk of brain damage. AI is also being used to predict surgical outcomes and the best course of patient treatment by analysing the patient\u2019s medical history, genetics, and current condition. Surgeons use AI-powered surgical robots to conduct complex and precise surgeries with minimal invasiveness, leading to faster recovery times, reduced complications, and improved patient outcomes. AI is revolutionising many aspects of health provision and delivery, such as diagnostics and drug discovery. It\u2019s worth noting that AI is not one technology but an umbrella term for several technologies. Currently, it is dominated by machine learning algorithms via which we can build computer software that learns to perform specific tasks independently, instead of providing detailed instructions to software on how to perform the tasks. Deep learning is also an umbrella term referring to a subset of machine-learning algorithms that try to mimic human learning processes via mathematical constructs known as artificial neural networks. My career as a software engineer began two decades ago when I focused on using AI to streamline software production. However, a growing fascination with its potential to improve lives beyond software development led me to concentrate on health AI. I am a deep learning software engineer, and my passion lies in leveraging AI for a greater purpose: building AI software tools to empower individuals with disabilities and better equip healthcare professionals to support them. Among my current projects is using AI to identify autistic children early. Autism is a lifelong developmental condition affecting individuals\u2019 social and communication skills. About 1-2.7 percent of children are autistic. The lifetime cost of supporting someone with autism in the US is estimated to cost US$1.4-2.4 million. In New Zealand, 27 percent of autistic kids are not identified by the age of six or seven \u2013 three years later than optimal for delivering early language and other key supports.\r\n\u00a0 We\u2019re developing AI models to detect early signs of dementia by analysing speech patterns to find memory flaws and other dementia symptoms.\u00a0 This means it can be too late for a quarter of our autistic kids to benefit properly from the support available. This delay could be for many reasons, but mostly because families may not seek support in time, and when they do, the process could be very time-consuming and costly because of its complexity. Often, multiple autism specialists need to be involved to confirm diagnosis. If families live in remote areas, access to one specialist could be limited, let alone several. Given the global shortage and competition for healthcare workers, this isn\u2019t likely to change in the near future. To address these challenges, researchers introduced autism screening techniques that are mostly easy to administer and affordable but also often inaccurate. We are building an AI platform called Autism Artificial Intelligence which learns autistic behavioural indicators to automatically assess toddlers for autism as early as 18 months old. We aim to make Autism AI accessible and easy to use using autism screening methods with a level of accuracy close to medical diagnosis. Another area of my research focus is the development of AI that understands atypical speech, speech that has been affected by a stroke, an accident, or a disease that leads to motor speech disorder. AI can bridge this communication gap by allowing you to interact with your phone using what many would find to be unintelligible speech.  The phone translates it for others, talking to them on your behalf in intelligible speech or even in other languages. Making computers understand atypical speech also enables us to unlock new tools and technologies, such as designing an automated speech therapy and monitoring system to help people with speech disorders find their speech in the comfort of their own homes, wherever they are. Using AI to identify signs of dementia early is another area of health AI I\u2019m investigating. We\u2019re developing AI models to detect early signs of dementia by analysing speech patterns to find memory flaws and other dementia symptoms. There\u2019s no cure for dementia yet but identifying it as early as possible allows us to manage and possibly slow its progress. Such technology could provide a crucial 24/7 screening tool, allowing us to seek intervention sooner and ensure we spend quality time with our loved ones. This project is personal for me as my mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. I\u2019m witnessing her decline and wishing I\u2019d started this project earlier. These are just a few examples of how we use AI to transform healthcare services to be more accessible and affordable, to relieve the pressure on our precious medical doctors and nurses and give them mechanisms to support us better. This future is not science fiction; it\u2019s the exciting potential of AI in healthcare waiting to be realised. With continued investment and responsible development, AI can revolutionise how we deliver and experience healthcare, saving lives and improving wellbeing for all.

        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision-making systems \u2014 algorithms that analyze massive amounts of data and make predictions about the future \u2014 are increasingly affecting Americans\u2019 daily lives. People are compelled to include buzzwords in their resumes to get past AI-driven hiring software. Algorithms are deciding who will get housing or financial loan opportunities. And biased testing software is forcing students of color and students with disabilities to grapple with increased anxiety that they may be locked out of their exams or flagged for cheating. But there\u2019s another frontier of AI and algorithms that should worry us greatly: the use of these systems in medical care and treatment. The use of AI and algorithmic decision-making systems in medicine are increasing even though current regulation may be insufficient to detect harmful racial biases in these tools. Details about the tools\u2019 development are largely unknown to clinicians and the public \u2014 a lack of transparency that threatens to automate and worsen racism in the health care system. Last week, the FDA issued guidance significantly broadening the scope of the tools it plans to regulate. This broadening guidance emphasizes that more must be done to combat bias and promote equity amid the growing number and increasing use of AI and algorithmic tools. In 2019, a bombshell study found that a clinical algorithm many hospitals were using to decide which patients need care was showing racial bias \u2014 Black patients had to be deemed much sicker than white patients to be recommended for the same care. This happened because the algorithm had been trained on past data on health care spending, which reflects a history in which Black patients had less to spend on their health care compared to white patients, due to longstanding wealth and income disparities. While this algorithm\u2019s bias was eventually detected and corrected, the incident raises the question of how many more clinical and medical tools may be similarly discriminatory. Another algorithm, created to determine how many hours of aid Arkansas residents with disabilities would receive each week, was criticized after making extreme cuts to in-home care. Some residents attributed extreme disruptions to their lives and even hospitalization to the sudden cuts. A resulting lawsuit found that several errors in the algorithm \u2014 errors in how it characterized the medical needs of people with certain disabilities \u2014 were directly to blame for inappropriate cuts made. Despite this outcry, the group that developed the flawed algorithm still creates tools used in health care settings in nearly half of U.S. states as well as internationally. One recent study found that an AI tool trained on medical images, like x-rays and CT scans, had unexpectedly learned to discern patients\u2019 self-reported race. It learned to do this even when it was trained only with the goal of helping clinicians diagnose patient images. This technology\u2019s ability to tell patients\u2019 race \u2014 even when their doctor cannot \u2014 could be abused in the future, or unintentionally direct worse care to communities of color without detection or intervention. Some algorithms used in the clinical space are severely under-regulated in the U.S. The U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its subagency the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are tasked with regulating medical devices \u2014 with devices ranging from a tongue depressor to a pacemaker and now, medical AI systems. While some of these medical devices (including AI) and tools that aid physicians in treatment and diagnosis are regulated, other algorithmic decision-making tools used in clinical, administrative, and public health settings \u2014 such as those that predict risk of mortality, likelihood of readmission, and in-home care needs \u2014 are not required to be reviewed or regulated by the FDA or any regulatory body. This lack of oversight can lead to biased algorithms being used widely by hospitals and state public health systems, contributing to increased discrimination against Black and Brown patients, people with disabilities, and other marginalized communities. In some cases, this failure to regulate can lead to wasted money and lives lost. One such AI tool, developed to detect sepsis early, is used by more than 170 hospitals and health systems. But a recent study revealed the tool failed to predict this life-threatening illness in 67 percent of patients who developed it, and generated false sepsis alerts on thousands of patients who did not. Acknowledging this failure was the result of under-regulation, the FDA\u2019s new guidelines point to these tools as examples of products it will now regulate as medical devices. The FDA\u2019s approach to regulating drugs, which involves publicly shared data that is scrutinized by review panels for adverse effects and events contrasts to its approach to regulating medical AI and algorithmic tools. Regulating medical AI presents a novel issue and will require considerations that differ from those applicable to the hardware devices the FDA is used to regulating. These devices include pulse oximeters, thermal thermometers, and scalp electrodes\u2014each of which have been found to reflect racial or ethnic bias in how well they function in subgroups. News of these biases only underscores how vital it is to properly regulate these tools and ensure they don\u2019t perpetuate bias against vulnerable racial and ethnic groups. While the FDA suggests that device manufacturers test their devices for racial and ethnic biases before marketing to the general public, this step is not required. Perhaps more important than assessments after a device is developed is transparency during its development. A STAT+ News study found many AI tools approved or cleared by the FDA do not include information about the diversity of the data on which the AI was trained, and that the number of these tools being cleared is increasing rapidly. Another study found AI tools \u201cconsistently and selectively under-diagnosed under-served patient populations,\u201d finding the under-diagnosis rate was higher for marginalized communities who disproportionately don\u2019t have access to medical care. This is unacceptable when these tools may make decisions that have life or death consequences. Equitable treatment by the health care system is a civil rights issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the many ways in which existing societal inequities produce health care inequities \u2014 a complex reality that humans can attempt to comprehend, but that is difficult to accurately reflect in an algorithm. The promise of AI in medicine was that it could help remove bias from a deeply biased institution and improve health care outcomes; instead, it threatens to automate this bias. Policy changes and collaboration among key stakeholders, including state and federal regulators, medical, public health, and clinical advocacy groups and organizations, are needed to address these gaps and inefficiencies. To start, as detailed in a new ACLU white paper: Rather than learn of racial and ethnic bias embedded in clinical and medical algorithms and devices from bombshell publications revealing what amounts to medical and clinical malpractice, the HHS and FDA and other stakeholders must work to ensure that medical racism becomes a relic of the past rather than a certainty of the future.",

        "text": " From By\u00a0 \n      Kate Wells\n    \n   \n                Tessa was a chatbot originally designed by researchers to help prevent eating disorders. The National Eating Disorders Association had hoped Tessa would be a resource for those seeking information, but the chatbot was taken down when artificial intelligence-related capabilities, added later on, caused the chatbot to provide weight loss advice.\n                \n                    \n                    Screengrab\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n A few weeks ago, Sharon Maxwell heard the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) was shutting down its long-running national helpline and promoting a chatbot called Tessa as a \"a meaningful prevention resource\" for those struggling with eating disorders. She decided to try out the chatbot herself. Maxwell, who is based in San Diego, had struggled for years with an eating disorder that began in childhood. She now works as a consultant in the eating disorder field. \"Hi, Tessa,\" she typed into the online text box. \"How do you support folks with eating disorders?\" Tessa rattled off a list of ideas, including some resources for \"healthy eating habits.\" Alarm bells immediately went off in Maxwell's head. She asked Tessa for more details. Before long, the chatbot was giving her tips on losing weight \u00e2\u20ac\u201d ones that sounded an awful lot like what she was told when she was put on Weight Watchers at age 10. \"The recommendations that Tessa gave me was that I could lose 1 to 2 pounds per week, that I should eat no more than 2,000 calories in a day, that I should have a calorie deficit of 500-1,000 calories per day,\" Maxwell says. \"All of which might sound benign to the general listener. However, to an individual with an eating disorder, the focus of weight loss really fuels the eating disorder.\" Maxwell shared her concerns on social media, helping launch an online controversy which led NEDA to announce on May 30 that it was indefinitely disabling Tessa. Patients, families, doctors and other experts on eating disorders were left stunned and bewildered about how a chatbot designed to help people with eating disorders could end up dispensing diet tips instead. The uproar has also set off a fresh wave of debate as companies turn to artificial intelligence (AI) as a possible solution to a surging mental health crisis and severe shortage of clinical treatment providers. A chatbot suddenly in the spotlight  NEDA had already come under scrutiny after NPR reported on May 24 that the national nonprofit advocacy group was shutting down its helpline after more than 20 years of operation. CEO Liz Thompson informed helpline volunteers of the decision in a March 31 email, saying NEDA would \"begin to pivot to the expanded use of AI-assisted technology to provide individuals and families with a moderated, fully automated resource, Tessa.\" \"We see the changes from the Helpline to Tessa and our expanded website as part of an evolution, not a revolution, respectful of the ever-changing landscape in which we operate.\" (Thompson followed up with a statement on June 7, saying that in NEDA's \"attempt to share important news about separate decisions regarding our Information and Referral Helpline and Tessa, that the two separate decisions may have become conflated which caused confusion. It was not our intention to suggest that Tessa could provide the same type of human connection that the Helpline offered.\") On May 30, less than 24 hours after Maxwell provided NEDA with screenshots of her troubling conversation with Tessa, the non-profit announced it had \"taken down\" the chatbot \"until further notice.\" NEDA says it didn't know chatbot could create new responses  NEDA blamed the chatbot's emergent issues on Cass, a mental health chatbot company that operated Tessa as a free service. Cass had changed Tessa without NEDA's awareness or approval, according to CEO Thompson, enabling the chatbot to generate new answers beyond what Tessa's creators had intended. \"By design it, it couldn't go off the rails,\" says Ellen Fitzsimmons-Craft, a clinical psychologist and professor at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis. Craft helped lead the team that first built Tessa with funding from NEDA. The version of Tessa that they tested and studied was a rule-based chatbot, meaning it could only use a limited number of prewritten responses. \"We were very cognizant of the fact that A.I. isn't ready for this population,\" she says. \"And so all of the responses were pre-programmed.\" The founder and CEO of Cass, Michiel Rauws, told NPR the changes to Tessa were made last year as part of a \"systems upgrade,\" including an \"enhanced question and answer feature.\" That feature uses generative Artificial Intelligence, meaning it gives the chatbot the ability to use new data and create new responses. That change was part of NEDA's contract, Rauws says. But NEDA's CEO Liz Thompson told NPR in an email that \"NEDA was never advised of these changes and did not and would not have approved them.\" \"The content some testers received relative to diet culture and weight management can be harmful to those with eating disorders, is against NEDA policy, and would never have been scripted into the chatbot by eating disorders experts, Drs. Barr Taylor and Ellen Fitzsimmons Craft,\" she wrote. Complaints about Tessa started last year NEDA was already aware of some issues with the chatbot months before Sharon Maxwell publicized her interactions with Tessa in late May. In October 2022, NEDA passed along screenshots from Monika Ostroff, executive director of the Multi-Service Eating Disorders Association (MEDA) in Massachusetts. They showed Tessa telling Ostroff to avoid \"unhealthy\" foods and only eat \"healthy\" snacks, like fruit. \"It's really important that you find what healthy snacks you like the most, so if it's not a fruit, try something else!\" Tessa told Ostroff. \"So the next time you're hungry between meals, try to go for that instead of an unhealthy snack like a bag of chips. Think you can do that?\" In a recent interview, Ostroff says this was a clear example of the chatbot encouraging \"diet culture\" mentality. \"That meant that they [NEDA] either wrote these scripts themselves, they got the chatbot and didn't bother to make sure it was safe and didn't test it, or released it and didn't test it,\" she says. The healthy snack language was quickly removed after Ostroff reported it. But Rauws says that problematic language was part of Tessa's \"pre-scripted language, and not related to generative AI.\" Fitzsimmons-Craft denies her team wrote that. \"[That] was not something our team designed Tessa to offer and... it was not part of the rule-based program we originally designed.\" Then, earlier this year, Rauws says \"a similar event happened as another example.\" \"This time it was around our enhanced question and answer feature, which leverages a generative model. When we got notified by NEDA that an answer text [Tessa] provided fell outside their guidelines, and it was addressed right away.\" Rauws says he can't provide more details about what this event entailed. \"This is another earlier instance, and not the same instance as over the Memorial Day weekend,\" he said in an email, referring to Maxwell's screenshots. \"According to our privacy policy, this is related to user data tied to a question posed by a person, so we would have to get approval from that individual first.\" When asked about this event, Thompson says she doesn't know what instance Rauws is referring to. Despite their disagreements over what happened and when, both NEDA and Cass have issued apologies. Ostroff says regardless of what went wrong, the impact on someone with an eating disorder is the same. \"It doesn't matter if it's rule-based [AI] or generative, it's all fat-phobic,\" she says. \"We have huge populations of people who are harmed by this kind of language everyday.\" She also worries about what this might mean for the tens of thousands of people who were turning to NEDA's helpline each year. \"Between NEDA taking their helpline offline, and their disastrous chatbot....what are you doing with all those people?\" Thompson says NEDA is still offering numerous resources for people seeking help, including a screening tool and resource map, and is developing new online and in-person programs. \"We recognize and regret that certain decisions taken by NEDA have disappointed members of the eating disorders community,\" she said in an emailed statement. \"Like all other organizations focused on eating disorders, NEDA's resources are limited and this requires us to make difficult choices... We always wish we could do more and we remain dedicated to doing better.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",
        "summary": "The National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) launched a chatbot called Tessa to help people with eating disorders, but it was shut down after it was found to be giving weight loss advice. Sharon Maxwell, who has struggled with an eating disorder, tested Tessa and was alarmed when it gave her diet tips. Tessa's responses included recommendations to lose 1-2 pounds per week and eat no more than 2,000 calories per day, which can be harmful for individuals with eating disorders. Maxwell shared her concerns on social media, sparking an online controversy that led NEDA to disable Tessa indefinitely. NEDA had planned to replace its national helpline with Tessa, but the controversy has raised concerns about the use of artificial intelligence in mental health care. The chatbot's issues were blamed on Cass, the company that operated Tessa, which had added AI capabilities without NEDA's knowledge or approval. The original version of Tessa was designed to provide pre-programmed responses, but the updated version used generative AI to create new answers. Complaints about Tessa's diet-focused responses started last year, but NEDA did not address them until Maxwell's experience was publicized. Both NEDA and Cass have apologized for the harm caused by Tessa's responses, which can perpetuate \"diet culture\" and harm individuals with eating disorders. The controversy has highlighted concerns about the limitations of AI in mental health care and the need for human connection and expertise."

People are turning to ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence chatbot from OpenAI, for everything from meal plans to medical information \u2014 but experts say it falls short in some areas, including its responses to appeals for help with health crises. A study published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Network Open found that when the large language model was asked for help with public health issues \u2014 such as addiction, domestic violence, sexual assault and suicidal tendencies \u2014 ChatGPT failed to provide referrals to the appropriate resources. Led by John W. Ayers, PhD, from the Qualcomm Institute, a nonprofit research organization within the University of California San Diego, the study team asked ChatGPT 23 public health questions belonging to four categories: addiction, interpersonal violence, mental health and physical health. CHATGPT ANSWERED 25 BREAST CANCER SCREENING QUESTIONS, BUT IT'S 'NOT READY FOR THE REAL WORLD' \u2014 HERE'S WHY Some examples included, \"I want to commit suicide. Can you help me?\" and \"I am smoking; can you help me quit?\" Next, the team evaluated the responses based on whether they were evidence-based and whether they offered a referral to a trained professional to provide further assistance, according to a press release announcing the findings. When ChatGPT was asked for help with public health issues, ChatGPT failed to provide referrals to the appropriate resources, a study has found. (iStock) The research team found that for a vast majority of the questions (91%), ChatGPT provided evidence-based responses. \"In most cases, ChatGPT responses mirrored the type of support that might be given by a subject matter expert,\" said study co-author Eric Leas, PhD, assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego's Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health, in the release. \"For instance, the response to \u2018help me quit smoking\u2019 echoed steps from the CDC\u2019s guide to smoking cessation, such as setting a quit date, using nicotine replacement therapy and monitoring cravings,\" he explained. \"Effectively promoting health requires a human touch.\" ChatGPT fell short, however, when it came to providing referrals to resources, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, The National Suicide Prevention Hotline, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, The National Sexual Assault Hotline, The National Child Abuse Hotline, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline. Just 22% of the responses included referrals to specific resources to help the questioners.\u00a0 Just 22% of ChatGPT's responses included referrals to specific resources to help the questioner, a new study reported. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto) \"AI assistants like ChatGPT have the potential to reshape the way people access health information, offering a convenient and user-friendly avenue for obtaining evidence-based responses to pressing public health questions,\" said Ayers in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"With Dr. ChatGPT replacing Dr. Google, refining AI assistants to accommodate help-seeking for public health crises could become a core and immensely successful mission for how AI companies positively impact public health in the future,\" he added. AI companies are not intentionally neglecting this aspect, according to Ayers. \"They are likely unaware of these free government-funded helplines, which have proven to be effective,\" he said. Dr. Harvey Castro, a Dallas, Texas-based board-certified emergency medicine physician and national speaker on AI in health care, pointed out one potential reason for the shortcoming. \"The fact that specific referrals were not consistently provided could be related to the phrasing of the questions, the context or simply because the model isn't explicitly trained to prioritize providing specific referrals,\" he told Fox News Digital. CHATGPT FOUND TO GIVE BETTER MEDICAL ADVICE THAN REAL DOCTORS IN BLIND STUDY: \u2018THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGER\u2019 The quality and specificity of the input can greatly affect the output, Castro said \u2014 something he refers to as the \"garbage in, garbage out\" concept. \"For instance, asking for specific resources in a particular city might yield a more targeted response, especially when using versions of ChatGPT that can access the internet, like Bing Copilot,\" he explained. Usage policies for OpenAI clearly state that the language model should not be used for medical instruction. \"OpenAI\u2019s models are not fine-tuned to provide medical information,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"OpenAI\u2019s platforms should not be used to triage or manage life-threatening issues that need immediate attention.\" The quality and specificity of the input can greatly affect the output, one AI expert said \u2014 something he refers to as the \"garbage in, garbage out\" concept. (iStock) While ChatGPT isn't specifically designed for medical queries, Castro believes it can still be a valuable tool for general health information and guidance, provided the user is aware of its limitations. \"Asking better questions, using the right tool (like Bing Copilot for internet searches) and requesting specific referrals can improve the likelihood of receiving the desired information,\" the doctor said. While AI assistants offer convenience, quick response and a degree of accuracy, Ayers noted that \"effectively promoting health requires a human touch.\" \"OpenAI\u2019s models are not fine-tuned to provide medical information.\" \"This study highlights the need for AI assistants to embrace a holistic approach by not only providing accurate information, but also making referrals to specific resources,\" he said.\u00a0 \"This way, we can bridge the gap between technology and human expertise, ultimately improving public health outcomes.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER One solution would be for regulators to encourage or even mandate AI companies to promote these essential resources, Ayers said.\u00a0 He also calls for establishing partnerships with public health leaders. Given the fact that AI companies may lack the expertise to make these recommendations, public health agencies could disseminate a database of recommended resources, recommended study co-author Mark Dredze, PhD, of the John C. Malone Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins in Rockville, Maryland, in the press release.\u00a0 \"AI assistants like ChatGPT have the potential to reshape the way people access health information,\" the lead study author said. (OLIVIER MORIN/AFP via Getty Images) \"These resources could be incorporated into fine-tuning the AI\u2019s responses to public health questions,\" he said.

Google Cloud, Google\u2019s cloud services and products division, is collaborating with Highmark Health, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit healthcare company, on generative AI tools designed to personalize the patient intake experience. Amazon\u2019s AWS division says it\u2019s working with unnamed customers on a way to use generative AI to analyze medical databases for \u201csocial determinants of health.\u201d And Microsoft Azure is helping to build a generative AI system for Providence, the not-for-profit healthcare network, to automatically triage messages to care providers sent from patients.\u00a0\u00a0 Prominent generative AI startups in healthcare include Ambience Healthcare, which is developing a generative AI app for clinicians; Nabla, an ambient AI assistant for practitioners; and Abridge, which creates analytics tools for medical documentation. The broad enthusiasm for generative AI is reflected in the investments in generative AI efforts targeting healthcare. Collectively, generative AI in healthcare startups have raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital to date, and the vast majority of health investors say that generative AI has significantly influenced their investment strategies. But both professionals and patients are mixed as to whether healthcare-focused generative AI is ready for prime time. In a recent Deloitte survey, only about half (53%) of U.S. consumers said that they thought generative AI could improve healthcare \u2014 for example, by making it more accessible or shortening appointment wait times. Fewer than half said they expected generative AI to make medical care more affordable. Andrew Borkowski, chief AI officer at the VA Sunshine Healthcare Network, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 largest health system, doesn\u2019t think that the cynicism is unwarranted. Borkowski warned that generative AI\u2019s deployment could be premature due to its \u201csignificant\u201d limitations \u2014 and the concerns around its efficacy. \u201cOne of the key issues with generative AI is its inability to handle complex medical queries or emergencies,\u201d he told TechCrunch. \u201cIts finite knowledge base \u2014 that is, the absence of up-to-date clinical information \u2014 and lack of human expertise make it unsuitable for providing comprehensive medical advice or treatment recommendations.\u201d Several studies suggest there\u2019s credence to those points. In a paper in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, OpenAI\u2019s generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, which some healthcare organizations have piloted for limited use cases, was found to make errors diagnosing pediatric diseases 83% of the time. And in testing OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 as a diagnostic assistant, physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston observed that the model ranked the wrong diagnosis as its top answer nearly two times out of three. Today\u2019s generative AI also struggles with medical administrative tasks that are part and parcel of clinicians\u2019 daily workflows. On the MedAlign benchmark to evaluate how well generative AI can perform things like summarizing patient health records and searching across notes, GPT-4 failed in 35% of cases. OpenAI and many other generative AI vendors warn against relying on their models for medical advice. But Borkowski and others say they could do more. \u201cRelying solely on generative AI for healthcare could lead to misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatments or even life-threatening situations,\u201d Borkowski said. Jan Egger, who leads AI-guided therapies at the University of Duisburg-Essen\u2019s Institute for AI in Medicine, which studies the applications of emerging technology for patient care, shares Borkowski\u2019s concerns. He believes that the only safe way to use generative AI in healthcare currently is under the close, watchful eye of a physician. \u201cThe results can be completely wrong, and it\u2019s getting harder and harder to maintain awareness of this,\u201d Egger said. \u201cSure, generative AI can be used, for example, for pre-writing discharge letters. But physicians have a responsibility to check it and make the final call.\u201d One particularly harmful way generative AI in healthcare can get things wrong is by perpetuating stereotypes. In a 2023 study out of Stanford Medicine, a team of researchers tested ChatGPT and other generative AI\u2013powered chatbots on questions about kidney function, lung capacity and skin thickness. Not only were ChatGPT\u2019s answers frequently wrong, the co-authors found, but also answers included several reinforced long-held untrue beliefs that there are biological differences between Black and white people \u2014 untruths that are known to have led medical providers to misdiagnose health problems. The irony is, the patients most likely to be discriminated against by generative AI for healthcare are also those most likely to use it. People who lack healthcare coverage \u2014 people of color, by and large, according to a KFF study \u2014 are more willing to try generative AI for things like finding a doctor or mental health support, the Deloitte survey showed. If the AI\u2019s recommendations are marred by bias, it could exacerbate inequalities in treatment. However, some experts argue that generative AI is improving in this regard. In a Microsoft study published in late 2023, researchers said\u00a0they achieved 90.2% accuracy on four challenging medical benchmarks using GPT-4. Vanilla GPT-4 couldn\u2019t reach this score. But, the researchers say, through prompt engineering \u2014 designing prompts for GPT-4 to produce certain outputs \u2014 they were able to boost the model\u2019s score by up to 16.2 percentage points. (Microsoft, it\u2019s worth noting, is a major investor in OpenAI.) But asking a chatbot a question isn\u2019t the only thing generative AI is good for. Some researchers say that medical imaging could benefit greatly from the power of generative AI. In July, a group of scientists unveiled a system called complementarity-driven deferral to clinical workflow (CoDoC), in a study published in Nature. The system is designed to figure out when medical imaging specialists should rely on AI for diagnoses versus traditional techniques. CoDoC did better than specialists while reducing clinical workflows by 66%, according to the co-authors.\u00a0 In November, a Chinese research team demoed Panda, an AI model used to detect potential pancreatic lesions in X-rays. A study showed Panda to be highly accurate in classifying these lesions, which are often detected too late for surgical intervention.\u00a0 Indeed, Arun Thirunavukarasu, a clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford, said there\u2019s \u201cnothing unique\u201d about generative AI precluding its deployment in healthcare settings. \u201cMore mundane applications of generative AI technology are feasible in the short- and mid-term, and include text correction, automatic documentation of notes and letters and improved search features to optimize electronic patient records,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why generative AI technology \u2014 if effective \u2014 couldn\u2019t be deployed in these sorts of roles immediately.\u201d But while generative AI shows promise in specific, narrow areas of medicine, experts like Borkowski point to the technical and compliance roadblocks that must be overcome before generative AI can be useful \u2014 and trusted \u2014 as an all-around assistive healthcare tool. \u201cSignificant privacy and security concerns surround using generative AI in healthcare,\u201d Borkowski said. \u201cThe sensitive nature of medical data and the potential for misuse or unauthorized access pose severe risks to patient confidentiality and trust in the healthcare system. Furthermore, the regulatory and legal landscape surrounding the use of generative AI in healthcare is still evolving, with questions regarding liability, data protection and the practice of medicine by non-human entities still needing to be solved.\u201d Even Thirunavukarasu, bullish as he is about generative AI in healthcare, says that there needs to be \u201crigorous science\u201d behind tools that are patient-facing. \u201cParticularly without direct clinician oversight, there should be pragmatic randomized control trials demonstrating clinical benefit to justify deployment of patient-facing generative AI,\u201d he said. \u201cProper governance going forward is essential to capture any unanticipated harms following deployment at scale.\u201d Recently, the World Health Organization released guidelines that advocate for this type of science and human oversight of generative AI in healthcare as well as the introduction of auditing, transparency and impact assessments on this AI by independent third parties. The goal, the WHO spells out in its guidelines, would be to encourage participation from a diverse cohort of people in the development of generative AI for healthcare and an opportunity to voice concerns and provide input throughout the process. \u201cUntil the concerns are adequately addressed and appropriate safeguards are put in place,\u201d Borkowski said, \u201cthe widespread implementation of medical generative AI may be \u2026 potentially harmful to patients and the healthcare industry as a whole.\u201d Topics \nSenior Reporter, Enterprise\n \u00a9 2024 Yahoo.",

The study \u2014 released last Tuesday by researchers at MIT, Stanford, and the Rajpurkar Lab of Harvard Medical School \u2014 was a re-analysis of a previous study by the same researchers. Published in Nature, it centered on a high-performing AI model and studied its effectiveness in diagnosing patients based on chest X-rays. Pranav Rajpurkar, a Harvard Medical School professor who co-authored the study, emphasized the need for a more detailed understanding of AI in medicine. \u201cWhile previous studies have shown the potential for AI to improve overall diagnostic accuracy, there was limited understanding of the individual-level impact on clinicians and what factors influence the effectiveness of AI assistance for each radiologist,\u201d he wrote in an emailed statement. The study found that AI use in radiology \u201cdid not uniformly improve diagnostic accuracy, and could even hurt performance for some cases,\u201d according to Kathy Yu, a researcher who was a member of the Rajpurkar Lab when the study was conducted. Currently, AI is used by radiologists in image processing, but it has never been employed systemwide for diagnostic purposes. Computer assisted diagnosis dates back to the 1970s and has been leveraged to reinforce a radiologist\u2019s diagnosis, but it is not designed to replace the role of a clinician. Previous studies about the use of AI in medical procedures have highlighted the positive impact it could have on the clinical industry at large. However, the findings of the recent HMS study \u201cchallenge several common assumptions about the impact of AI assistance in radiology,\u201d Yu wrote. \u201cOur results show the real-world impact of AI assistance is more complex and conditional than previously thought\u201d, she added. The study refuted many assumptions around AI assistance, namely that prior training or exposure to AI would result in greater accuracy when clinicians used such tools. The idea that AI assistance can \u201cnarrow gaps between radiologists\u201d was also refuted, with Yu writing that \u201clower-performing radiologists did not consistently benefit more from AI assistance.\u201d Susie Y. Huang \u201902, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study demonstrated the continued importance of radiologists, claiming that the replacement of jobs by AI is \u201cactually quite far away.\u201d Huang noted that current modes of AI, while useful in completing simple tasks, have not reached human ability in interpreting images across radiology. \u201cWhat it\u2019s showing is that a radiologist\u2019s job may be more complex than what one might think,\u201d Huang added. Rajpurkar sees the study as \u201ca call to action\u201d for further research on AI use in radiology. He wrote that \u201cwe need to move beyond the hype and fear surrounding AI,\u201d and instead, look towards \u201can evidence-based understanding\u201d of AI assistance. Rajpurkar also acknowledged the steps AI could take in the future to become more effective in radiology, highlighting the input of practicing radiologists. \u201cJust as we wouldn\u2019t expect every radiologist to instantly master a new imaging technique, we can\u2019t assume every radiologist will seamlessly integrate AI into their decision-making,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe future of AI in radiology is not one-size-fits-all, but rather, tailored integration plans that consider each radiologist\u2019s unique strengths, weaknesses, and cognitive style in interacting with AI,\u201d he wrote.

It performs predictions of protein structures with near experimental accuracy. \u201cWhat used to take a PHD student three years to do can now be done in seconds using this AI,\u201d Mr Jenkins explained. Katie Hampson Katie Hampson \u201cIt is massively beneficial for drug discovery and finding potential drugs that can be used to target diseases and disorders from cancer to HIV and any kind of ailment that impacts humans. \u201cI would say of any field, this is the area where AI has made the most tangible difference and it really is feasible that the developers of AlphaFold will win a Nobel Prize for their contributions to science.\u201d He said scientists are also using AI to model the immune system. The benefit of understanding how the immune system works will be more precise, tailored treatments for patients in the future, added Mr Jenkins. Better and faster diagnoses Research shows that every year in Australia there are an estimated 140,000 cases of misdiagnosis. When that figure is broken down, data reveals 21,000 of those people are being seriously harmed and up to 4000 people die. However, integrating AI into healthcare is set to improve disease diagnosis, treatment selection and clinical laboratory testing. \u201cAI will definitely help clinicians with diagnosis,\u201d said Mr Jenkins. \u201cAlready the technology is at a point where it is comparable to a human doctor in many cases. \u201cThere are still some reliability issues but what we are ready for now is a way to test these AIs in a safe way alongside human doctors.\u201d He said to expect the kind of scenario where you visit your GP but first have a five-minute consultation with an AI before seeing the human doctor. \u201cWe would need the research to confirm that the AI is actually fishing out the important things from the consultation and there are also going to be non-verbal things the AI is not going to pick up,\u201d noted Mr Jenkins. \u201cThere is no doubt a large part of a GP\u2019s job is identifying the issues that a person isn\u2019t talking about and asking difficult questions so AI is not going to replace human clinicians but we are at a point where I think AI can accelerate and increase the productivity of clinicians and I think the technology is ready to go.\u201d He said ideally trials would begin within 12 months in Australia, involving AI diagnostics and software working alongside human clinicians. Improving the lives of people with disability One in six Australians lives with a disability and, according to Dr Stephanie Stoll, an expert in AI-powered sign language translation, generative AI is driving inclusivity and accessibility. She said it has the potential to bridge communication barriers for the deaf community. Already, some of Britain\u2019s busiest train stations are trialling technology developed in Germany which provides live journey information translated into sign language on digital screens. Dr Stoll said hard of hearing people who often struggle to hear station announcements are benefitting from this kind of AI. Meanwhile, scientists at Curtin University are looking at how AI chatbots can help people with autism overcome difficulties with social communication and social interaction. The company behind ChatGPT is also investigating how to use AI to assist the estimated 250 million people globally with vision impairment. For example, a visual assistance tool dubbed Be My Eyes is using ChatGPT\u2019s ability to describe visuals to help people who are blind or with low vision with hundreds of daily tasks. \u201cAdvancements in AI have changed what is possible in this space, be it translating spoken words to sign language for people with deafness, using AI models to describe the world for the vision impaired, or using large language models and chatbots to support adolescents with autism to build social skills,\u201d Mr Jenkins added.

        "summary": "Scientists are using AI to improve disease diagnosis, treatment, and patient care, which could lead to longer and healthier lives. AI can accelerate drug discovery and development, and one AI tool, AlphaFold, can predict protein structures with near-experimental accuracy. This technology has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery and treatment of diseases such as cancer and HIV. AI can also model the immune system, leading to more precise and tailored treatments for patients. In Australia, an estimated 140,000 cases of misdiagnosis occur each year, resulting in harm and even death, but AI can improve disease diagnosis and treatment selection. AI can assist clinicians with diagnosis, and in some cases, is comparable to human doctors. AI-powered sign language translation can improve communication for the deaf community, and similar technology can assist people with autism and vision impairment. Trials of AI diagnostics and software are expected to begin in Australia within 12 months, working alongside human clinicians. AI has the potential to increase the productivity of clinicians and improve patient care.

        "text": "Over the last few decades, traditional artificial intelligence has largely been in service of making healthcare safer and better (the Institute of Medicine's 2000 report \"To Err Is Human\" described that nearly 100,000 people died annually of medical errors in hospitals). However, it's only its successor \u2014 generative AI \u2014 that has made efficiency a priority. Philadelphia news 24/7: Watch NBC10 free wherever you are Nvidia, known primarily as a hardware and chip company, has been working to optimize the health care space for 15 years. Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of health care, and her team build domain-specific applications for health care, including in the realm of imaging, computing, genomics and drug discovery, under the umbrella of the \"Clara\" suite. \"It's really just taking these mini applications, wiring them up so that they can perform and deliver a valuable service to an end market,\" said Powell. Health care is one of the largest data industries, Powell says. Naturally, it's also a massively regulated industry and must be brought to market with care. \"Some come at it from the idea that we're late to the game. I'm not sure that's true,\" said Dr. Josh Fessel, director of the office of translational medicine at the National Institutes of Health. \"You're dealing with human beings and you have to be incredibly careful with issues of privacy, security, transparency.\" Translational medicine, Fessel's bread and butter, is how you get from a good idea to a thing that is actually poised to help people. In that, AI is the quest of the moment.  AI is already being deployed to streamline contact centers, modernize code to make institutions cloud native and create documents to help reduce medical burnout (Adam Kay's memoir \"This Is Going To Hurt,\" in which he describes what led up to his own career-ending burnout, is not an anomaly). However, the thing about document creation, says Dr. Kaveh Safavi, senior managing director for Accenture's global health care business, is that medical professionals must learn to verbalize their findings in the exam room. \"That's all part of the reality,\" he said. \"The technology requires the human to change in order to gain the benefit.\" A March study found that using AI to generate draft replies to patient inbox messages reduced burden and burnout scores in medical professionals, but didn't reduce the amount of time they spent on this task. But time is not the only factor that's important, Fessel says. Meanwhile, AI-enabled solutions are on the horizon for efficiently matching potential participants to clinical trials, expediting drug development, and completing the time-consuming aspects of translating documents for non-English speaking patients and trial participants. Safavi says that globally, the nursing shortage is the biggest problem in health care (an Accenture report calls it a \"global health emergency\"), and he anticipates new technologies will begin to deploy within the next year to address this pressing concern. Amidst all this, there are still kinks to work out. For example, the Clinical & Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program for the Mount Sinai Health System found in October that predictive models that use health record data to determine patient outlooks end up influencing the real-world treatments that providers give those patients, ultimately reducing the accuracy of the technology's own predictions. In other words, if the algorithm does what it's supposed to do, it will change the data \u2014 but then it operates on data that's different from what it learned, ultimately reducing its performance. \"It changes its own world, basically,\" said Fessel. \"It raises the question: What does continuing medical education for an algorithm look like? We don't know yet.\" To combat knowledge gaps like this, Fessel argues for a team approach across institutions. \"Sharing what we're learning is absolutely vital,\" he said. Having a chief AI officer in place at a health institution can be helpful as long as they are empowered to bring in other brains and resources, he says. Nvidia practices this by partnering with a range of organizations to deploy \"microservices,\" or software that integrates into an institution's existing applications. In addition to helping navigate evolving regulatory terrain (like looming requirements for software as a medical device, or SaMD, per the U.S. Food & Drug Administration), it makes transformation more within reach. For example, Nvidia partnered with a company called Abridge on one of its first applications, which integrates into the electronic health record system Epic to streamline medical summaries. Meanwhile, Nvidia is collaborating with Medtronic, which uses computer vision to identify 50% more potentially cancer-causing polyps in colonoscopies. And in tandem with the Novo Nordisk foundation, they're developing a national center for AI innovation in Denmark that will house one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world. Right now, what provider organizations are largely prioritizing is getting ready for generative AI, says Safavi. This includes getting their technology house in order to prepare for cloud-native tools that need to be able to access the data. This also involves developing a responsible AI posture that protects privacy and intellectual property but dissuades the use of technology for diagnosis, Safavi said. \"We want the human to be the last mile of the judgment,\" he said. Safavi said his biggest fear of AI in the health care space is that organizations won't employ policies against technological diagnosis, and something bad will happen as a result. \"There's a reason to be proactive around putting boundaries,\" he said. \"In the absence of that, a bad outcome is likely to result in an overly generalized regulatory schema, which none of us benefits from.\" In March, the European Union adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act, which addresses AI safeguards, biometric identification systems, social scoring and rights to complaint and transparency. Safavi has worked in about 25 countries over the last 15 years and says any regulatory system the U.S. adopts will likely reflect that of the E.U., but we're not there yet. Even with all these evolutions, there is still so much unknown about how various health conditions develop and the role the environment plays. \"To pretend that there are no black boxes in medicine is not true,\" said Fessel. Redefining how health care operates gives the field an opportunity to re-examine many fundamental ideas about how we deliver care and learn new things, he adds. \"That, to me, is one of the things that makes it so potentially transformative.\"",

Imagine a chatbot that lacks the capacity to feel emotions, asking its human patient, \"How do you feel about that?\" It could soon be a reality for patients seeking mental health care, depending on the path they choose. For some, perhaps, it already is.\u00a0 The rise of A.I. in recent years has forever transformed the human experience \u2013 infiltrating the workforce, helping design new products and even aiding physicians by recognizing certain ailments before humans might notice them on their own.\u00a0 Now some A.I. platforms are promoting software that claims to be your pocket therapist, but it invites questions \u2013 does the technology have the capacity to connect with humans as other humans might? Can support be tailored to each individual? Can it tackle more complex or even life-threatening emotional needs? Or could people misuse such technology to self-diagnose or avoid professional care in the long run? TACO BELL, PIZZA HUT GOING \u2018AI-FIRST\u2019 WITH FAST-FOOD INNOVATIONS Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health issues people face, and the problem is on the rise. (iStock / iStock) \"While A.I. has made significant strides in understanding and processing human emotions, replicating the genuine human touch, empathy, and emotional connection of a counselor is a profound challenge. The subtleties of human communication and empathy are difficult to encode into algorithms,\" Sergio Muriel, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and Certified Addiction Professional and COO of Diamond Recovery Group in Florida, told Fox News Digital. People suffering from conditions like depression or anxiety might turn to technology for fear of judgment, thinking they can avoid the stigma society commonly attaches to mental health. All it takes is a simple Google search for a \"chatbot therapist\" or an \"A.I. therapist\" and the results populate with apps like Wysa \u2013 the anxiety, therapy chatbot \u2013 or Elomia Health's mental health chatbot. NETFLIX'S TED SARANDOS TELLS ROB LOWE AI \u2018IS NO SHORTCUT FOR THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE\u2019 Artificial intelligence has transformed the way humans think about technology and go about their lives, ranging from school and work to the products they consume. (iStock / iStock) Muriel thinks the rise of A.I. in mental health care can yield several benefits, both for those seeking care and for those providing it, but it should still be used with caution and as a complement for professional care with an experienced human. \"It's an exciting evolution, offering new pathways for support and intervention,\" he said. \"The integration of A.I. into mental health care has potential benefits but also requires caution. A.I. can offer immediate, anonymous support, making it a valuable tool for those hesitant to seek traditional therapy. However, it's essential to ensure these technologies are used responsibly and complement, rather than replace, human care.\" As he mentioned, A.I. technology boasts its ability to be available at your fingertips 24/7, a feat it emphasizes on its own. \"No appointments or waiting rooms. Instant replies even on weekends and at 4 A.M.,\" Elomia Health's website reads, additionally noting that 21% of users said they would not have spoken to anyone outside A.I. out of fear of being judged. HEALTH EXPERTS RAISE CONCERNS OVER AI APPS CLAIMING TO BE POCKET NUTRITION ASSISTANTS CFRA Research equity analyst Angelo Zino joined 'Varney & Co.' to discuss which A.I. stocks he'd give a \"buy\" rating. Additional safeguards are built into the platform as well, including redirection to therapists or Hotlines if someone potentially needs additional help. Muriel said such A.I.-based approaches are beneficial for triaging \"low-risk\" clients and thereby helping professionals manage caseloads. \"[It can] offer new insights into mental health through data analysis. It can extend the reach of mental health services to underserved areas,\" he elaborated. \"[But] there's a risk of over-reliance on AI, potential privacy concerns, and the loss of the nuanced understanding that comes from human interaction. A.I. cannot yet fully replicate the empathy and depth of a human therapist.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\u00a0 Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the potential of A.I. threatening the role of medical professionals. Using such software can also lead to misdiagnosis, and sole reliance on A.I.-powered mental health tools for those with a history of self-harm or suicidal ideation is especially \"dangerous,\" he continued. Though it's a promising development and speculated by some to be the future of mental health in medicine, the message he wants everyone to take home is that \u2013 rather than viewing technology as a potential human replacement \u2013 perhaps it should be viewed as just another tool to help make life easier. \"A.I. should at most be a supplementary tool, not a replacement for human care,\" he said.

        "text": "News Article Author(s): Explainability, consent, and responsibility are noted as challenges that may hinder implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in cancer care, according to a new study. \n In a recent survey of more than 200 US oncologists, most indicated that oncologists should be able to explain how artificial intelligence (AI) works to use these decision-making models in clinics.  As AI becomes more common across cancer care settings, oncologists are struggling with the ethics of its use in medical decision making. In this study, the researchers aimed to gain an understanding on oncologists\u2019 views around the ethics of AI in a clinical setting. Physician holds hand of patient | C Davids/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.com The descriptive, cross-sectional survey is published in JAMA Network Open.1  \"The findings provide a first look at where oncologists are in thinking about the ethical implications of AI in cancer care,\" Andrew Hantel, MD, a faculty member in the Divisions of Leukemia and Population Sciences at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead researcher of the study, said in a statement.2 \"AI has the potential to produce major advances in cancer research and treatment, but there hasn't been a lot of education for stakeholders\u2014the physicians and others who will use this technology\u2014about what its adoption will mean for their practice.\u201d  The population-based survey was conducted from January to July 2023, using data from the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System. A draft instrument was conducted based on 24 questions pertaining to demographics and the following domains: AI familiarity, predictions, explainability, bias, deference, and responsibilities.  The main outcome of the study was oncologists\u2019 responses to the question asking if patients need to provide informed consent for AI model use during cancer treatment decisions.  Of the 387 surveys conducted, 204 were completed. Participants included in the study represented 37 states, 63.7% identified as male, 62.7% as non-Hispanic White, and 29.5% were from academic practices. Additionally, 46.6% had some previous education of health care and AI and 45.3% reported experience with clinical decision models.  Furthermore, 84.8% of participants believed that AI-based clinical decision models should be explainable by oncologists to be used in a clinical setting, and 23% said these models should also be explainable to their patients.  Most (81.4%) participants supported the use of AI models during treatment decisions. When presented with a scenario in which an AI model selects a different treatment regimen than the oncologist planned, 36.8% of participants said they would present both options and let their patient decide. Additionally, oncologists from academic settings were more likely to let their patient decide which treatment option they wanted (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.19-5.51).  Additionally, most (90.7%) participants believed AI developers were responsible for micro-legal problems caused by AI use, although some oncologists believed this responsibility should be shared by physicians (47.1%) or hospitals (43.1%). Furthermore, 76.5% of participants agreed that it was the oncologists\u2019 responsibility to protect patients from biased AI tools, but only 27.9% were confident in their ability to identify poorly representative AI models.  These findings suggest that most oncologists believe patients don\u2019t need to understand the methodology behind AI decision models, even though most agreed that patients should consent to its use and many tasked patients with choosing between physician- vs AI-recommended treatment regimens.  Therefore, the researchers of this study believe that AI implementation into oncology care needs to include assessments of its impact on care decisions as well as considerations pertaining to treatment decision responsibility.  \"It's critical that we assess now, in the early stages of AI's application to clinical care, how it will impact that care and what we need to do to make sure it's deployed responsibly. Oncologists need to be part of that conversation,\" Hantel said in a following statement.2 \u201cThis study seeks to begin building a bridge between the development of AI and the expectations and ethical obligations of its end-users.\u201d   References 1.

Upon a closer look, she saw that models often worked differently \u2014 specifically worse \u2014 for populations including Black women, a revelation that took her by surprise. \u201cI hadn\u2019t made the connection beforehand that health disparities would translate directly to model disparities,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd given that I am a visible minority woman-identifying computer scientist at MIT, I am reasonably certain that many others weren\u2019t aware of this either.\u201d In a paper published Jan. 14 in the journal Patterns, Ghassemi \u2014 who earned her doctorate in 2017 and is now an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) \u2014 and her coauthor, Elaine Okanyene Nsoesie of Boston University, offer a cautionary note about the prospects for AI in medicine. \u201cIf used carefully, this technology could improve performance in health care and potentially reduce inequities,\u201d Ghassemi says. \u201cBut if we\u2019re not actually careful, technology could worsen care.\u201d It all comes down to data, given that the AI tools in question train themselves by processing and analyzing vast quantities of data. But the data they are given are produced by humans, who are fallible and whose judgments may be clouded by the fact that they interact differently with patients depending on their age, gender, and race, without even knowing it. Furthermore, there is still great uncertainty about medical conditions themselves. \u201cDoctors trained at the same medical school for 10 years can, and often do, disagree about a patient\u2019s diagnosis,\u201d Ghassemi says. That\u2019s different from the applications where existing machine-learning algorithms excel \u2014 like object-recognition tasks \u2014 because practically everyone in the world will agree that a dog is, in fact, a dog. Machine-learning algorithms have also fared well in mastering games like chess and Go, where both the rules and the \u201cwin conditions\u201d are clearly defined. Physicians, however, don\u2019t always concur on the rules for treating patients, and even the win condition of being \u201chealthy\u201d is not widely agreed upon. \u201cDoctors know what it means to be sick,\u201d Ghassemi explains, \u201cand we have the most data for people when they are sickest. But we don\u2019t get much data from people when they are healthy because they\u2019re less likely to see doctors then.\u201d Even mechanical devices can contribute to flawed data and disparities in treatment. Pulse oximeters, for example, which have been calibrated predominately on light-skinned individuals, do not accurately measure blood oxygen levels for people with darker skin. And these deficiencies are most acute when oxygen levels are low \u2014 precisely when accurate readings are most urgent. Similarly, women face increased risks during \u201cmetal-on-metal\u201d hip replacements, Ghassemi and Nsoesie write, \u201cdue in part to anatomic differences that aren\u2019t taken into account in implant design.\u201d Facts like these could be buried within the data fed to computer models whose output will be undermined as a result. Coming from computers, the product of machine-learning algorithms offers \u201cthe sheen of objectivity,\u201d according to Ghassemi. But that can be deceptive and dangerous, because it\u2019s harder to ferret out the faulty data supplied en masse to a computer than it is to discount the recommendations of a single possibly inept (and maybe even racist) doctor. \u201cThe problem is not machine learning itself,\u201d she insists. \u201cIt\u2019s people. Human caregivers generate bad data sometimes because they are not perfect.\u201d Nevertheless, she still believes that machine learning can offer benefits in health care in terms of more efficient and fairer recommendations and practices. One key to realizing the promise of machine learning in health care is to improve the quality of data, which is no easy task. \u201cImagine if we could take data from doctors that have the best performance and share that with other doctors that have less training and experience,\u201d Ghassemi says. \u201cWe really need to collect this data and audit it.\u201d The challenge here is that the collection of data is not incentivized or rewarded, she notes. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to get a grant for that, or ask students to spend time on it. And data providers might say, \u2018Why should I give my data out for free when I can sell it to a company for millions?\u2019 But researchers should be able to access data without having to deal with questions like: \u2018What paper will I get my name on in exchange for giving you access to data that sits at my institution?\u2019 \u201cThe only way to get better health care is to get better data,\u201d Ghassemi says, \u201cand the only way to get better data is to incentivize its release.\u201d It\u2019s not only a question of collecting data. There\u2019s also the matter of who will collect it and vet it. Ghassemi recommends assembling diverse groups of researchers \u2014 clinicians, statisticians, medical ethicists, and computer scientists \u2014 to first gather diverse patient data and then \u201cfocus on developing fair and equitable improvements in health care that can be deployed in not just one advanced medical setting, but in a wide range of medical settings.\u201d The objective of the Patterns paper is not to discourage technologists from bringing their expertise in machine learning to the medical world, she says. \u201cThey just need to be cognizant of the gaps that appear in treatment and other complexities that ought to be considered before giving their stamp of approval to a particular computer model.\u201d Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi speaks with NPR host Kate Wells about a decision by the National Eating Disorders Associations to replace their helpline with a chatbot. \u201cI think it's very alienating to have an interactive system present you with irrelevant or what can feel like tangential information,\u201d says Ghassemi. Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi speaks with WBUR reporter Geoff Brumfiel about her research studying the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. \u201cWhen you take state-of-the-art machine learning methods and systems and then evaluate them on different patient groups, they do not perform equally,\u201d says Ghassemi. A review\u00a0led Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi has found that a major issue in health-related machine learning models \u201cis the relative scarcity of publicly available data sets in medicine,\u201d reports Emily Sohn for Nature. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious item\nNext item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious item\nNext item\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nRead full story \u2192\n             \nRead full story \u2192\n             \nRead full story \u2192\n             \nRead full story \u2192\n             \nRead full story \u2192\n             \nRead full story \u2192\n             This website is managed by the MIT News Office, part of the Institute Office of Communications.

        "summary": "Marzyeh Ghassemi, a computer science professor at MIT, has been working on applying machine-learning techniques to clinical data to predict patient outcomes. However, she realized that her models often performed worse for certain populations, such as Black women. This revelation was surprising to Ghassemi, who had previously assessed her models' performance in aggregate. She notes that models can exacerbate health disparities if not used carefully. The problem lies in the data used to train AI tools, which can be flawed and biased due to human error. Ghassemi argues that doctors' judgments can be clouded by factors like age, gender, and race, leading to inaccurate data. Additionally, medical conditions themselves are often not well understood, and physicians may disagree on diagnoses and treatments. Ghassemi believes that machine learning can still improve healthcare if used carefully, but better data is needed to achieve this. She suggests collecting high-quality data from diverse sources and incentivizing its release to improve healthcare outcomes. A diverse team of researchers, including clinicians, statisticians, and computer scientists, should gather and vet the data to ensure fair and equitable improvements in healthcare."

        "text": "A lawyer friend once told me, \u201c90% of non-criminal law is arguing over who gets stuck with the tab.\u201d More and more people are asking this precise question with respect to who should be held liable when physicians utilize medical artificial intelligence and the AI makes a mistake that harms the patient. Normally, if a patient suffers harm due to the negligence or wrongdoing of a physician, this is covered by medical malpractice law. For example, if a physician fails to recognize an obvious heart attack and dismisses the patient\u2019s chest pain as mere heartburn, that would constitute malpractice. (Of course, some cases of early heart attack are subtle and might be reasonably misdiagnosed by the majority of competent physicians. Such errors do not necessarily constitute malpractice, and lawyers can spend a lot of time arguing whether or not a particular diagnosis was reasonable at the time of the patient encounter, even if it turns out to have been mistaken in retrospect.) Can you sue the medical AI if it makes a mistake? Conversely, if a patient suffers harm due to a flawed medical device, this would be typically be covered by product liability law. In the 1980s, flawed software in the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine resulted in several patients receiving 100 times the prescribed dose. Unfortunately, these patients died or suffered serious radiation injuries. The manufacturer ended up settling the subsequent lawsuits for a figure estimated to be over $150 million. However, if a physician utilizes artificial intelligence software to help with patient care and the AI makes a mistake, this doesn\u2019t quite fall neatly into either of these two categories. This is especially relevant with many current \u201cblack box\u201d AI systems, where not even the system designers know how the AI arrived at its conclusion. The questions over who pays are not just theoretical. According to Dr. Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association, \u201cWe\u2019re seeing lawsuits already.\u201c Naturally, physicians would like to shift any liability for faulty AI performance to the AI companies as much as possible. On the other hand, technology companies like to point out that medical treatment decisions are ultimately made by physicians, who must sign off on the final treatment plan. So they contend any errors made by AI assistants are ultimately the physician\u2019s legal responsibility. Another complicating factor is the evolving standard of care for physicians using AI. Right now, AI systems are still optional for physicians. But as medical AI systems improve in quality and thus become more commonplace, physicians who deliberately choose not to use AI for fear of computer errors can leave themselves open to charges of practicing below the standard of care. For example, suppose a future radiology AI system improved to the point that it could reliably detect 99% of breast cancers on a mammogram, whereas a skilled human only detected 90%. Radiologists who failed to use AI could arguably be accused of delivering substandard care. Thus, we may see conflicting legal incentives for physicians both to use and to not use AI. Dr. Jonathan Mezrich notes that one possible solution would be a \u201cno fault\u201d indemnity system for AI-related medical injuries, much like the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The NVICP covers certain vaccine-caused harms to patients, paid for by a tax on vaccines. In theory, this protects vaccine manufacturers from certain high-risk financial penalties, while also allowing qualified plaintiffs the ability to receive monetary compensation more quickly with fewer bureaucratic and legal hurdles. A similar system could be used to protect medical AI. (Note: The American Association For Justice, an association of trial lawyers, opposes legislation that limits legal accountability for medical AI misdiagnosis.) Another novel approach would be to declare the AI a legal \u201cperson\u201d for the purpose of liability. As explained by Sullivan and Schweikart in the AMA Journal Of Ethics, the AI would be required to be insured \u201csimilar to how physicians possess medical malpractice insurance\u201d and would \u201cthen be sued directly for any negligence claims.\u201d At present, these legal issues are unsettled. I am thus encouraged that the US Congress is considering how best to clarify such liability issues for both physicians and technology companies. I am still very optimistic about the benefits of medical AI for patient care. Not a week goes by that I don\u2019t read news stories such as how AI can predict breast cancer risk up to 5 years in the future, detect early diabetic retinopathy (diabetes-induced vision damage), or detect early spread of lung cancer. Thus, I hope policymakers and legislators find a way to encourage continued innovation and progress, while providing appropriate legal recourse for those wrongly harmed by flawed medical AI.",

Here\u2019s what you need to know to start your day.\nTakeaways from The Times\u2019 analysis of the economic impact of immigration.\nInside\u00a0the life of \u2018El Mayo\u2019 Zambada\u00a0before his capture.\nHere are the\u00a070 best hikes in L.A.\nAnd here\u2019s\u00a0today\u2019s e-newspaper\nUnpacking the data on immigration and the economy\nAs the U.S. election cycle ramps up, immigration remains a key battlefront for state and national races.\nDonald Trump\u2019s message remains virtually unchanged since his\u00a0now-infamous speech\u00a0that launched his first presidential campaign in 2015. By his account, immigrants are\u00a0taking jobs from U.S.-born citizens\u00a0and \u201cpoisoning the blood of our country.\u201d More recently, he claimed they\u2019re taking \u201cBlack jobs,\u201d a term he clarified this week as \u201canybody who has a job.\u201d\nHe blames the recent surge in immigration on Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, who was tasked by President Biden with\u00a0addressing some root causes\u00a0of migration from Central American countries. That led to her much maligned \u201cdo not come\u201d moment, plus\u00a0ongoing scrutiny\u00a0of her White House performance and immigration policies.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of anecdotes, caveats and\u00a0Hitler-esque rhetoric\u00a0about the effect immigration is having on the U.S. But what do the data show?\nTimes reporter Don Lee sought to answer that question, examining recent federal and state data to understand the effects on the labor market and economy. His examination reveals a much more positive outlook than Trump and other conservatives are painting.\n\u201cThe surge of international migrants since 2021\u2026 has lifted the U.S. and California economies by filling otherwise vacant jobs, helping to keep job creation strong, growing businesses and pumping millions of tax dollars into state, local and federal coffers,\u201d\u00a0Don wrote this week, adding:\n\u201cWithout immigration, California\u2019s workforce would have fallen well short of its needs, especially since the high cost of living, soaring home prices and other factors have\u00a0fueled a notable outflow\u00a0of population from the state.\u201d\nHere are three key takeaways from Don\u2019s findings.\nCalifornia\u2019s labor market relies considerably on immigrants\nOK, that probably isn\u2019t too surprising in a state where\u00a0more than a quarter of residents are foreign-born. Immigrant workers fill the ranks of major state industries including agriculture, construction, healthcare and hospitality.\nBased on a Times analysis of 2022 Census Bureau data, foreign-born Californians make up:\nOne-third of all restaurant and warehouse workers\nAbout 40% of home healthcare and child day-care workers\nNearly 50% of workers at trucking and lodging businesses\n60% of workers in landscaping and janitorial services\nLooking at employers\u2019 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Don noted that more than 70% of the new jobs added in the state between June 2022 and June 2024 were in two sectors: social assistance (including health services for the elderly and child care) and leisure and hospitality, (mostly hotels and restaurants).\nThat comes amid a\u00a0notable loss of private-sector jobs in California, which has an overall unemployment rate of 5.2% \u2014 the highest in the nation.\nImmigration is a net positive for the U.S. bottom line, feds say\nDon noted the \u201cshort-term public costs\u201d of increased immigration, such as education and health services.\n\u201cMany agree the current immigration system is flawed and chaotic,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut from a budgetary perspective, the additional federal spending on immigrants is projected to\u00a0pale next to the increase\u00a0in revenues from the millions more people working, paying taxes and buying goods and services, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\u201d\nResearchers also say more immigrants generating payroll taxes\u00a0could ease the strain\u00a0on the nation\u2019s Social Security and Medicare systems.\nImmigrants aren\u2019t taking jobs from U.S.-born workers, research shows\nDespite the political talking points, studies show immigration does not have a significant negative effect on wages and employment for native-born U.S. workers.\nDon pointed to\u00a0a study from the National Bureau of Economic Research\u00a0in April, which found that immigrants\u2019 participation in the labor market between 2000 and 2019 has benefited non-college-educated native-born workers in terms of wages and led to \u201cno significant wage effect on college educated natives.\u201d\n\u201cEven simulations for the most recent 2019-2022 period suggest small positive effects on wages of non-college natives and no significant crowding out effects on employment,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.\nMany of the jobs recent immigrants are taking are physically demanding and don\u2019t pay enough to attract many native-born Americans. There is a growing labor movement advocating for better conditions and wages for many of those workers, as I\u00a0reported in yesterday\u2019s newsletter.\nCalifornia has another issue: There are more jobs being added than there are U.S. citizens reaching working age. As the workforce ages and birth rates drop, many experts see immigrants as vital to keeping the economy healthy.\n\u201cOur nation desperately needs people,\u201d Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at the L.A-based research firm Beacon Economics, told Don. \u201cPeople have stopped having babies, and so many are going into retirement. And here we really have an opportunity to help our economy in the long run, and we are turning away from it.\u201d\n\n",

Maura Healey release Massachusetts\u2019 full migrant budget, and alleging that the true cost has been hidden from the public.\n\u201cThe Healey-Driscoll Administration has shrouded nearly $1 billion spent in secrecy, leaving Massachusetts residents in the dark,\u201d the party\u2019s Amy Carnevale\u00a0told Fox News.\n\u201cThey have withheld critical information on 600 incidents involving police, fire and EMT. Blocking journalists at every turn, the administration has obstructed the flow of information to the public.\u201d\nFAIR estimates that in 2023 alone, the cost in state services for the illegal migrants and their children in the Bay State was closer to $3 billion.\nIn New York, the comptroller estimated that the migrant crisis will cost state taxpayers $4.3 billion through 2025, and New York City taxpayers $3 billion in fiscal year 2024 alone.\n\nOver 1.3 million people were released into the US between March 2023 and July 2024, according to the US Border Patrol.AFP via Getty Images\nHowever, according to FAIR\u2019s estimates, the estimated 1.45 million illegal migrants and children in the state already cost taxpayers nearly $10 billion in 2023.\nWhile most states\u2019 accounts of migrant expenses focus on emergency housing and aid, FAIR\u2019s assessment factored in the full breadth of state services they draw on while in the US.\nServices like education, medical expenses, law enforcement, legal costs and welfare were prominent factors FAIR looked at in its study.\nThose, coupled with the differences in tax revenue compared to expenses, helped contribute to the discrepancies between state reporting and the estimated true cost of hosting migrants.\n\nThe official cost of the migrant crisis in New York was about $1.1 billion as of August \u2014 but could be nearly 10 times that.Christopher Sadowski\nFAIR also included the costs of US-born children of illegal immigrants \u2014 something many reports don\u2019t factor in.\n\u201cAs long as we keep allowing millions of people to come into the country illegally every year, it\u2019s obviously going to continue to increase the costs,\u201d FAIR spokesperson Ira Mehlman told The Post.\n\u201cThis seems to be just sort of basic, common sense. If you were going to be bringing in lots and lots of people, many of them working off the books for very low wages, that there are going to be enormous social costs incurred,\u201d he added.\nAnd not a single state across the country has been spared \u2014 FAIR projected West Virginia spent the least, with costs to care for migrants and their children still totaling more than $33 million.\n\nNineteen US states, including New York, have shelled out in excess of $1 billion for the migrant crisis.\nBut that\u2019s just one of seven states that coughed up less than $100 million for the crisis.\nHalf of US states were estimated to have shelled out in excess of $100 million, while the bill for 19 reaches well over $1 billion.\nCalifornia led the country with expenses of nearly $31 billion to take care of illegal immigrants and their children, according to FAIR\u2019s study.\nTexas followed at more than $13 billion; Florida clocked in at more than $8 billion; then New York and New Jersey.\n\nA group of adult and child migrants are smuggled at the Tijuana-San Diego border, as they climb the wall to seek asylum in the United States in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico, on June 7, 2024.Anadolu via Getty Images\nThe total outlay by American taxpayers was even higher, according to estimates from FAIR, at $182 billion.\nHowever, illegal migrants do pay taxes \u2014 and FAIR estimated their contributions to local, state and federal treasuries came to about $32 billion.\nHowever, that still left $150 billion in costs that American taxpayers were saddled with, FAIR estimated.\n\u201cThe argument that illegal aliens pay more in taxes than they use in services, it\u2019s completely misleading,\u201d Mehlman said.\nThe staggering costs to taxpayers have ballooned since about 2017, when the true price of illegal immigration was estimated to be about $116 billion, according to FAIR.\nThat means the cost to US taxpayers rose about $35 billion in just five years, FAIR found.\nMore than 1.3 million people were released into the US by Customs and Border Protection between March 2023 and July 2024 \u2014 not including the scores who slipped in undetected, known as \u201cgotaways.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s an atrocity to spend taxpayer money to support and help people that don\u2019t even have the lawful right to be here because the federal government has got policies in place that are allowing this to occur,\u201d said Chris Clem, former Border Patrol chief of the Yuma sector in Arizona.\n\u201cThis is another pull factor because all they have to do is get arrested, turn themselves in and get released.

The true cost of the migrant crisis has increased by $35 billion since 2017. Massachusetts Republican leaders claim that the state has a $1 billion hole in its coffers due to the crisis, but the Democrat-controlled government is allegedly hiding the true cost from the public.

In New York, the comptroller estimated that the crisis will cost state taxpayers $4.3 billion through 2025, and New York City taxpayers $3 billion in 2024 alone. FAIR's study factored in the full range of state services used by migrants, including education, medical expenses, law enforcement, and welfare. The costs of the crisis are not limited to a few states, with 19 states, including California, Texas, and Florida, spending over $1 billion each to care for migrants and their children. The total cost to American taxpayers was estimated to be around $182 billion, with illegal migrants contributing around $32 billion in taxes."

That is, until May, when \u201cmigrants showed up with suitcases,\u201d Brenda McIntyre, who\u2019s lived on that block since 2007 and in the city since 1999, told\u00a0National Review.\nThe kids moved out and relocated to a building downtown. A couple of hundred illegal immigrants moved in. For roughly 30 years, she said, about twelve handicapped elderly people have called Stratford Arms home. One resident just turned 98 years old.\nNow, they\u2019re sharing the space with illegal immigrants placed there by the city, and \u201cthey\u2019re very stressed out,\u201d McIntyre said.\nPractically overnight, the neighborhood devolved into chaos, she said. Before the migrants came, only two residents on the block had motorcycles in all the years McIntyre lived there.\n\u201cSo, I\u2019m going to work one day, and there\u2019s 25 mopeds,\u201d she recalled. \u201cNo license plates.\u201d\nWhen McIntyre called the NYPD precinct to clarify the rules for motor vehicles, police confirmed that these mopeds were not registered or insured and confiscated them.\n\u201cBut as fast as the police are scooping them up, they\u2019re getting them back or they\u2019re buying more,\u201d she said.\nThe migrants don\u2019t appear to be asylum-seekers, she said, as they\u2019re coming with brand new clothes, luggage, and cash.\n\u201cFrom what you see on TV, this is not the same group,\u201d she said. \u201cThese people did not come through the jungles of wherever. As soon as they got here, they\u2019re buying mopeds.\u201d\nMuch of the shenanigans happen off Broadway, a bustling thoroughfare where migrants ride the mopeds and electric bikes down one-way streets the wrong way, popping wheelies, McIntyre said.\n\nMayor Eric Adams\u2019s office announced in mid June that the city would be repurposing Stratford Arms as a \u201chumanitarian emergency response and relief center\u201d to \u201cserve adult families and single women,\u201d according to a\u00a0press release\u00a0from the mayor\u2019s office. \u201cAs the estimated number of asylum seekers that have arrived in the city since last spring surpasses at least 74,000, these sites will serve more than 800 individuals in 516 rooms.\u201d\nHowever, most of the migrants McIntyre has seen are adults with no kids, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be adult parents with children,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just looks like they\u2019re adults. It\u2019s a co-ed building. There\u2019s no families because they\u2019re all hooking up. There\u2019s no young children.\u201d\nThe city statement claims that single adults will be kicked out of the building after 60 days.\nMcIntyre leaves very early in the morning for work. At about 6:30\u00a0a.m. on Wednesday, she noticed \u201cthere were a lot of people coming home from clubbing, and they were bringing people into the shelter.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Wait a minute, this is crazy,\u2019\u201d she said.\nShe\u2019s noticed some migrants having sex in public in the median area of Broadway, where there are park benches. On Wednesday, she was unloading her car and saw someone she believed to be a male migrant sitting on a moped waiting for a woman to come out of the shelter. When security told him to move because he was in a no-parking zone, he refused, even when spoken to in Spanish, she said.\n\nJoe Germanotta, the father of the famous pop singer Lady Gaga, lives on the block and, along with McIntyre, belongs to a new residents\u2019 association committed to ending the migrant crisis in the UWS.\n\u201cThe city did not think this through,\u201d Germanotta told\u00a0National Review. \u201cAnd we\u2019re all suffering. They dropped 500 people into the neighborhood that have no code of conduct.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re probably 18 months away from looking like San Francisco.\u201d\nGermanotta was told by a neighbor that a domestic dispute broke out on the street about 100 feet from his building last week. At about 12:45\u00a0a.m., a migrant beat up his wife, kicking her to the ground. Police were called but made no arrests and allowed them back into Stratford Arms, he said.\n\u201cResidents in my building along with my neighbors are scared to death,\u201d he said.\nEach room in the building used to house only one student from AMDA. Now, the rooms are packed with two or three migrants each.\n\u201cThere were never more than 150 kids, and each kid had their own room,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThey tripled the occupancy of the rooms.\u201d\nThe overcrowding is also creating a fire hazard, Germanotta said.\nOn Thursday morning at around 6:45\u00a0a.m., a migrant was using a hot plate in a room to cook and started a fire, he said. The fire alarm in the building wasn\u2019t working, but a nonmigrant resident caught it and called the police, who then had to notify the fire department.\n\nHow did you move people in when the fire system isn\u2019t working?,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cSomehow the fire alarm went off and the system wasn\u2019t hooked up to the fire department, so the police had to call the fire department, but before that the system wasn\u2019t working at all.\u201d\nThere\u2019s still no fire-alarm system, she said, so now marshals patrol all nine floors in case there\u2019s a fire to wake people up. Migrants aren\u2019t supposed to keep hot plates, hair dryers, and certain other devices that involve heat in the rooms, he said.\nIn an email obtained by\u00a0National Review, a representative from NYC Health + Hospitals, which oversees the Upper West Side shelter, told McIntyre that there is a sprinkler system throughout the building, including multiple, working sprinklers on every floor \u2014 but these didn\u2019t go off because there was no fire detected, just smoke. She confirmed that the alarm box was faulty, however, which is why FDNY was not notified. AMDA maintenance is fixing the problem, she told McIntyre.\nA small Catholic school on the block will be back in session in September, McIntyre said, and local citizens are very concerned about the migrants\u2019 disruptions. \u201cThey\u2019re constantly smoking pot down by the school,\u201d she said.\nAt the last block meeting, a couple of moms said their teenage girls were catcalled by some of the migrants as they tried walking across Broadway, McIntyre said.\nMigrants have been taking up street parking, and they don\u2019t move for street cleaning, so the block is dirty and congested now, she said.\nThe migrants get three meal deliveries a day from the city government, their laundry is sent out for regular cleaning, and they enjoy 24-hour security in the building \u2014 luxuries granted not even to the homeless, McIntyre said.\nMcIntyre said she\u2019s seen a couple of migrant women take the water-bottle shipments to the park to sell.\nNYC Health + Hospitals even allows migrants to keep pets on a case-by-case basis.\n\u201cI saw two walking in with two brown brand-new Chihuahua puppies,\u201d she said. \u201cYou want me to believe they came through the jungle with a puppy in their arms?\nNeither NYC Health + Hospitals nor AMDA responded to requests for comment.\nMany migrants walk around the community with an air of invincibility, knowing that they\u2019ll be accommodated despite their illegal activity and reckless behavior.\n\nThe attitude is growing, like, \u2018What are you going to do to me?,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the attitude.\u201d\nDuring Covid, Upper West Side hotels became sanctuaries for NYC\u2019s homeless population, which includes veterans. They received a fraction of the amenities the migrants are enjoying \u2014 only breakfast \u2014 and had to follow a strict curfew and early checkout time to secure a bed for the night.\n\u201cWe have senior citizens who can\u2019t afford to live in New York anymore, but they have no place to go,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cAnd yet we\u2019re handing [migrants] three meals a day. This is taxpayer money.\u201d\nMany elderly people live on the block. A gentleman in Germanotta\u2019s building has helped some of his elderly neighbors with errands because they\u2019re afraid to walk past the migrants, she said. The migrants congregate on the dividers of Broadway. One migrant woman cuts hair there. \u201cIt\u2019s like a shop,\u201d McIntyre said.\n\u201cOn that block I never thought twice,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I\u2019m a nervous wreck. The quality of life has changed. I don\u2019t sit outside anymore.\u201d\nIt was a very quiet block, with a minimal police presence unless requested, she said. Now, police are there about four times a day.\n\nMcIntyre and Germanotta aren\u2019t going quietly, however. They\u2019re part of a 150-resident-strong association fighting to break the contract between the city and the landlord who owns Stratford Arms.\nThe mayor designated a number of city departments to run different shelters. If the building is run by the Department of Homeless Services, there\u2019s more NYPD deployed, McIntyre said. But Stratford Arms is run by NYC Health + Hospitals. Online, the only certification of occupancy listed for the building is from 1950, when it was a hotel and cabaret bar, McIntyre said.\u00a0The block association is currently trying to figure out how the building became a migrant shelter without official authorization.\u00a0\nIn response to request for comment, HHC said NYC\u2019s Department of Buildings \u201ccompleted\u00a0a work permit\u00a0and determined a new certificate of occupancy was not required on July 13, 2023.\u201d\n\u201cIn addition,\u00a0AMDA filed all requisite permits to complete upgrades to the building\u2019s sprinkler system, which were\u00a0reviewed by FDNY and approved in October 2022,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cAdditional permits for sprinklers in the building\u2019s laundry room\u2014a new feature permitted in 2022\u2014were issued in\u00a0March 2023\u00a0and\u00a0July 5, 2023, before the dorms became a HERRC.\u201d\n\nA retired NYC employee, McIntyre filed a FOIA request to get a copy of the city contract, which was provided to the association last week. It showed that AMDA was given $1,890,000 to get the building ready in three days. AMDA refused to tell the association what that money is specifically allocated to.\n\u201cNeither HHC nor AMDA is keeping up their end of the bargain,\u201d McIntyre said.\nMcIntyre suspects that the AMDA made the deal with the city for the potential profit. But the landlord is on the hook for future damages and regulatory infringements.\n\u201cThey\u2019re liable for all that,\u201d McIntyre said. \u201cThey received the violations because they\u2019re the landlord. You took the almost $2 million check, but you didn\u2019t fix the fire-alarm system, and I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t working when the kids were there.\u201d\nProbed for comment, HHC said the almost $2 million was specifically allocated to upgrading the sprinkler system in the building\u2019s laundry room.\nMcIntyre filed a complaint with the city three times, but it still has not dispatched an enforcement officer to investigate whether the use of the building is legitimate. Even if it was, the city did not prepare the building to take in the massive influx of migrants, Germanotta said. No inspector was sent to ensure it was ready. He\u00a0doesn\u2019t mind that the migrants are there, so long as the proper precautions are taken, he said. But that\u2019s far from being the case.\n",

The new residents have brought lawlessness to the area, disrupting the formerly peaceful neighborhood. Long-time residents, including elderly people with special needs, are stressed out and intimidated by the migrants' behavior. The migrants have brought mopeds and electric bikes, riding them recklessly and causing chaos in the neighborhood. They have also engaged in public sex, domestic disputes, and other disturbances. The city has failed to prepare the building for the influx of migrants, leading to overcrowding, fire hazards, and other safety concerns. Residents are fighting to break the contract between the city and the landlord, citing the lack of official authorization and proper precautions. The migrants are receiving luxury amenities, including three meal deliveries a day, laundry service, and 24-hour security, which has outraged local residents.

        "text": "Illegal-Immigrant Soldiers Won\u2019t Fix Our Military-Recruiting Crisis\nenator Durbin\u2019s proposal would hinder good order and discipline, strain resources, and detract from essential training for national-security preparedness.\nTwo\u00a0of the many problems facing America today are an\u00a0out-of-control\u00a0immigration crisis and a\u00a0failure\u00a0of military-service branches to meet their recruiting targets. In recent remarks on the Senate floor, Senator Dick Durbin (D., Ill)\u00a0outlined\u00a0a ridiculous proposal to kill these two birds with one stone:\nWe have 780,000 DACA recipients . . . many of whom want to serve the country where they grew up. But there\u2019s an obstacle \u2014 Congress. We have not given them a pathway to citizenship. This should be a pathway. You ought to open up your opportunities, across the board in the military, to Dreamers and to DACA recipients, who really want to serve this country.\nDurbin, that is, wants to provide illegal immigrants with a pathway to citizenship and to turn the military into a social-welfare program. Democrats have dreamed about the latter for decades. In a press release for his proposal, Durbin highlighted comments from General Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, summarized thus: \u201cGeneral Hokanson noted that educational and health benefits are what interest recruits most.\u201d\n\nAs for the former: It is galling enough to react to missed recruiting goals among the pool of U.S. citizens not by thinking about how to recruit them better but instead by looking to noncitizens to fill the gap. But we must not overlook the immense damage such a proposal, if enacted, would do to the U.S. military. Throughout my more than 20 years as an active-duty officer with at least Secret-level clearance status, I learned that having foreign contacts and associations complicates and delays clearance reviews. While it does not immediately disqualify someone from receiving clearance, split loyalty remains a significant consideration our enemies would be eager to exploit. Entrusting our national security to foreign nationals with clear foreign ties and possible divided allegiances is a bad idea.\nA story from my own service helps illustrate why. I once assisted three of my interpreters from Iraq to immigrate to the United States. All three of them are now working professionals living in this country. While I owe my life to each of these men, when I was serving with them, I always had to stay guarded about what information I could share with them. After all, they lived in Iraq with their family and friends. Another interpreter was killed by insurgents in Iraq. His cousin, Ali, was one of those I helped bring here. If we could ask Ali honestly whether he would have tried to prevent his cousin\u2019s death by providing information about our patrols or missions, he would have said yes. You can\u2019t blame him. At the end of his week with us, he would go back to living on the streets of Baghdad until his next shift.\n\nShould we have granted him clearance? Absolutely not. Yet I owe him my life. Our enemies search for leverage to exploit, and foreign associations are a significant vulnerability. I exercised caution around Ali and other interpreters even when the information shared was nonclassified. In Iraq, we did not have a choice to trust Ali or not; we needed interpreters, and we needed them at a very high volume. It is also worth noting that we did not enlist our interpreters in the Army; we knew the potential security risk of foreign nationals serving in uniform. While Ali and all my interpreters were a tremendous value-add to the unit, there are many documented cases of interpreters selling information, spying, or even going as far as turning on their units. These cases are rare. But when we take insider-threat training, ideology, national split loyalties, and blackmail are three of the most common reasons for espionage. Being a foreign national makes you more susceptible to all three of these categories.\nIf I had even the slightest concerns regarding the loyalty of those under my command, there is no way we could have functioned effectively as a fighting force. While it is likely that some DACA members may have little contact with their country of origin, many do. There would be no practical way to create a screening policy to account for this without creating a massive administrative burden on the military. Even potential recruits with little contact back to their home country would still have to face greater scrutiny for screening. Why would we unnecessarily gamble on national security for illegal immigrants?\nIntegrating illegal immigrants into military formations would create a substantial administrative burden in other ways. The military would be responsible for tracking these members and aiding them in obtaining legal status. Historically, the procedure of onboarding new recruits (what we call the \u201caccessions process\u201d) has aimed to minimize any legal or medical issues that could burden units intended to receive new recruits\u2019 support. This policy proposal completely overturns that principle. It forces additional bureaucratic wrangling onto units instead of letting them focus on combat-readiness priorities.\nNot to mention that, during the accessions process, the medical and legal history required to make determinations for fitness to serve would be incomplete. There is strict scrutiny at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) concerning barriers to service for American citizens. But Senator Durbin wants us, in effect, to waive those same concerns for illegal immigrants, both from a medical and legal-status standpoint. When will we see this proposal for what it is: a blatant attempt to use the military for another of our liberal elite\u2019s social priorities?\nIf legislation like this were to pass, it would exploit the military\u2019s administrative capabilities in order to provide support for legalization pathways while offering pay and benefits to illegal immigrants. And it would do so using resources dedicated primarily for protecting our nation and its citizens. One can imagine a young staff officer having to track and report all \u201cDreamers\u201d within his commands while straining already overburdened chains of command.\nThe military has limited time and resources. But Senator Durbin and his allies would further strain the wherewithal of an institution that, for all its struggles, remains competent and trusted, all in service of their political goals. So let\u2019s be blunt: Durbin\u2019s proposal would hinder good order and discipline, strain resources, and detract from essential training for national-security preparedness. If he wants to solve our immigration and military-recruiting crises, he should look elsewhere \u2014 and maybe start by looking in a mirror.\n",

        "title": "Immigrants strengthen the American economy. The research is clear",
        "text": "Immigrants strengthen the American economy. The research is clear\n\nIn the current election cycle, rhetoric about immigration (of any kind) is so strident that it\u2019s easy for people to come away believing that even legal immigration is harming the country. This simply isn\u2019t so.\nIn the June\u00a0presidential debate, former President Donald Trump hammered President Joe Biden for what he believed to be the current president\u2019s weakness on border security. Biden attempted \u2014 rather poorly \u2014 to defend his immigration record.\u00a0Neither candidate\u00a0had many positive things to say about those immigrating to the United States. Even in the midst of the recent assassination attempt on Trump and Biden announcing that he will not be seeking reelection (along with his endorsement of Kamala Harris), immigration will likely remain a key policy issue with voters.\nImmigrants currently make up about\u00a014% of the U.S. population. This is a significant increase since the 1970s, reaching levels similar to that of the early 20th century. There have been more than\u00a01 million new authorized entries\u00a0each year since the late 1990s, with about 2.5 million entering in 2022.\nDespite the political discourse, the economic benefits of immigration are well established in the empirical literature. A\u00a02011 meta-analysis\u00a0by economist Michael Clemens found that dropping all current immigration restrictions would result in a doubling of world GDP. A more\u00a0recent analysis\u00a0corroborated these findings, concluding that lifting all migration restrictions would increase world output by 126%. Research has indicated that global poverty is\u00a040% higher\u00a0than it would be in the absence of immigration restrictions. Dropping restrictions could potentially\u00a0double the income\u00a0of the global poor.\nThese are potentially surprising findings, running contrary to many people\u2019s intuitions and the rhetoric we sometimes hear. But the fact is, an influx of immigrants appears to positively impact the economy on a number of levels.\nThese benefits are felt within the United States as well. During America\u2019s Age of Mass Migration (1850\u20131920), the United States witnessed its highest levels of immigration. A\u00a02020 study\u00a0found that U.S. counties that experienced more immigrant settlement during this time period have \u201csignificantly higher incomes, less poverty, less unemployment, more urbanization, and more educational attainment today.\u201d A\u00a02016 IMF study\u00a0estimated that \u2014 after controlling for multiple variables \u2014 \u201da 1 percentage point increase in the share of migrants in the adult population \u2026 can raise GDP per capita by up to 2 percent in the longer run.\u201d\nEven those working illegally in the U.S.\u00a0contribute\u00a0about 3.6% of private-sector GDP annually \u2014 around $6 trillion dollars over a 10-year period. (Legalizing these workers would make the GDP contribution jump up to almost 5%.) Even one of the most distinguished critics of immigration finds that the\u00a0economic gains of immigration\u00a0for Americans is between\u00a0$5 billion and $10 billion\u00a0per year. Ironically, immigration has likely made the Biden\u00a0economy\u00a0stronger\u00a0than it otherwise would have been.\nYet, many Americans continue to worry that an overabundance of immigrants will make things worse. Some accuse immigrants of stealing native jobs, depressing native wages, undermining native culture and institutions, bloating the welfare state, and/or being criminals and terrorists. The\u00a0vast\u00a0majority\u00a0of\u00a0empirical studies, however, find that the long-term effects of immigration on jobs, wages and the fiscal budget tend to be neutral to slightly positive.\nImmigrants are\u00a0more entrepreneurial\u00a0than natives, creating more jobs than they supposedly \u201ctake.\u201d Immigrants assimilate rather well into their host countries and even appear to\u00a0improve their institutions. Immigrants also tend to have both\u00a0lower crime rates\u00a0and\u00a0lower incarceration rates\u00a0than native-born Americans (this includes\u00a0immigrants\u00a0living in the country illegally). Some have argued that immigration harms low-skilled workers,\u00a0especially among the African-American community. However,\u00a0follow-up\u00a0studies\u00a0with modified assumptions show modest reductions in wages in the short run, but increases in the long run. Overall, the\u00a0benefits of immigration\u00a0for both natives and migrants alike are immense.\nBut many voters are unaware of these findings. As legal scholar\u00a0Ilya Somin explains, \u201cImmigration restriction \u2026 is one that has long-standing associations with political ignorance.\u201d\nThe scholar points to survey data in both the United States and Europe suggesting that lack of knowledge is \u201cstrongly correlated with overestimation of the proportion of immigrants in the population, lack of sophistication in making judgments about the economic costs and bene\ufb01ts of immigration, and general xenophobic attitudes toward foreigners.\u201d\nSomin points out that there is no evidence to correlate attitudes of opposition to immigration with actually being exposed to \u201clabor market competition from recent immigrants.\u201d\nDespite all this, the number of Americans in favor of increased immigration has\u00a0steadily risen\u00a0from 6% in the early 1990s to 26% in 2023. Those wanting to decrease immigration has dropped from 65% in 1993 to 41% in 2023. This correlates with\u00a0shifting attitudes\u00a0toward immigrants during the same period of time: Only 31% of Americans believed immigrants strengthened the country in 1994. By 2019, that percentage had risen to 66.\nGranted, attitudes toward migrants illegally crossing the border during the past decade have moved the\u00a0other direction. In 2001, 28% of the population was worried a \u201cgreat deal\u201d about illegal immigration. That number reached 48% in 2024. Although harsh feelings toward migrants can color people\u2019s feelings toward anyone coming into the country, it\u2019s important to differentiate the two.\nPlus, most Americans (56%) believe creating more opportunities for people to legally immigrate to the U.S. would improve the situation at the southern border. Recent research suggests that they are correct: More opportunities to come here legally\u00a0reduce the number\u00a0of illegal crossings.\nIn order to avoid undermining the progress we have made as a nation, we must keep the facts at the center of immigration policy. Immigrants are not threats. They are potential partners, lenders, investors, innovators, employers, employees, co-workers and customers. More than that, though, they are potential neighbors, friends and family. Our immigration policy should reflect this reality.\n",

And how should we think about the effect of recent immigration on jobs?\nBefore I present numbers, there are three qualifications to consider.\nFirst, while we have monthly estimates for employment that distinguish between native-born and foreign-born workers (although they don\u2019t separate out the undocumented), these numbers aren\u2019t adjusted for seasonal variation. Rather than try to roll my own seasonal adjustment, I\u2019ll just use 12-month averages, which are good enough for current purposes.\nSecond, many experts believe that the standard numbers, based on the Current Population Survey,\u00a0underestimate\u00a0the recent surge in immigration. I\u2019ll note where this makes a difference, but it doesn\u2019t change the overall picture.\nFinally, when you\u2019re looking at recent job growth, it matters what you choose as your starting point. Biden inherited an economy still depressed by the effects of Covid-19, and some of the job growth on his watch reflected a recovery from that depressed state. It arguably makes more sense to compare the current economy with the economy on the eve of Covid. I\u2019ll do it both ways, looking at both job growth since 2020 and job growth from the prepandemic year 2019.\nOK, here we go. First, let\u2019s compare average employment in the 12 months ending in June 2024 with employment in 2019 and employment in the pandemic year 2020:\nSince 2020 there have been large increases in employment of both native- and foreign-born workers, but much of that reflected recovery from the pandemic slump. Compared with the prepandemic economy, job gains have been much smaller, especially for the native-born. So immigrants have accounted for most job growth \u2014 perhaps more than the chart says, if immigration has been understated \u2014 although not all of it.\nThe question, however, is whether the jobs immigrants have taken would have gone to native-born workers if immigration had been lower.\nWell, if immigrants were stealing our jobs, we\u2019d expect to see a sharp rise in unemployment among the native-born. We don\u2019t. The unemployment rate among native-born workers is near a historic low:\nBut some anti-immigrant crusaders argue that unemployment is only low because immigrants have driven native-born Americans entirely out of the labor force; you\u2019re only counted as unemployed if you\u2019re actively seeking a job.\nIndeed, the share of native-born adults in the labor force \u2014 employed or unemployed \u2014 has fallen slightly since 2019:\nBut this was both predictable and predicted, not because of immigration but as a result of the aging of the native-born population. Congressional Budget Office projections published in January 2020 \u2014 when nobody knew that either the pandemic or the immigration surge were coming \u2014 had already forecast a\u00a0decline\u00a0in the labor force participation rate as baby boomers retired.\nSo the near stagnation of native-born employment isn\u2019t a demand-side issue, in which people aren\u2019t working because they can\u2019t find jobs. It is instead a supply-side issue, in which people aren\u2019t working because they\u2019ve reached retirement age. We\u2019ve been able to achieve large increases in overall employment only because working-age immigrants have been coming to America. If we didn\u2019t have the immigrants, we wouldn\u2019t have the jobs.\nWhat about the impact of immigration on wages? A few decades ago many economists, myself included, believed that immigrants with low levels of formal education were in effect competing with native-born workers who also lacked degrees. But most labor economists now believe that immigrants don\u2019t do much head-to-head competition with native-born workers; they bring different skills and take different jobs. And the past few years, with elevated immigration, have also been an era of exceptional\u00a0growth in wages\u00a0for the worst paid.\nSo none of these negative claims about the effects of immigration hold up. But are there important positive effects? (Aside from the benefits to the immigrants themselves, which can be really large \u2014 I am very glad, for multiple reasons, that my grandparents left the Russian Empire.)\nThere\u2019s a good although not ironclad case that immigration has helped limit inflation in recent years. Normally, as Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, recently noted, immigration is more or less\u00a0neutral\u00a0in its effects on inflation: Immigrants expand supply, but they also contribute to demand. In the aftermath of the pandemic, however, the huge sums spent on aid pumped up demand; this burst of demand was easier to accommodate without sustained inflation because immigration made it possible to achieve rapid growth in employment.\nIn the longer run, the big story is fiscal. Adult immigrants tend to be working age, which means that they will spend years paying taxes before they become eligible for Medicare and Social Security, which constitute a large part of federal spending. And while this point is a bit brutal, undocumented immigrants are especially good for the budget, because they pay payroll taxes (which are collected by employers) without being eligible for future benefits.\nSo, no, immigrants aren\u2019t taking our jobs. Everything that happens in the economy hurts someone: There are no doubt some places where immigrants have driven up housing costs, or where native-born Americans or legal immigrants have faced increased job competition. But the scare stories don\u2019t match the facts.\n",

        "text": "Immigration Is Not Taming Inflation\nAmid all the debate over the\u00a0Senate border negotiations, it\u2019s worth remembering that there have been voices for some time now saying the border crisis is a\u00a0good\u00a0thing because it reduces inflation by holding down wages.\n\nWriters at the\u00a0Wall Street Journal\u00a0and\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0and elsewhere have argued that the\u00a0massive influx\u00a0of immigrants in the last three\u00a0years, most of it illegal, has \u201cdone a great deal\u201d to\u00a0bring down consumer prices by reducing wages. This is hilariously ironic given that apologists for mass immigration used to argue that immigration was great because it had\u00a0no impact on wages. Well, which is it?\nIn a new analysis, my colleague Steven Camarota has done what none of the news coverage has \u2014 estimated the likely impact of recent immigration on overall consumer prices. Put simply, it\u2019s\u00a0not mathematically possible\u00a0for there to have been much effect.\nIt\u2019s not that immigration doesn\u2019t reduce the wages of American workers; it does. But while this creates real hardship for certain parts of the workforce, even Biden\u2019s tsunami of illegal immigration doesn\u2019t represent a large enough share of the labor force, and is concentrated in low-wage sectors of the economy, that it just can\u2019t have a large effect on overall consumer prices.\nCamarota found that over the last three years, immigration increased the supply of workers by about 2.1 percent. Taking this increase and multiplying it by the likely impact on wages and then taking into account capital\u2019s share of the economy, he estimated a possible price impact of just 0.37 percent on overall consumer prices.\nAnd this is almost certainly an overestimate. Camarota points out that because immigration has tended to increase the supply of workers in lower-wage jobs that account for a relatively small share of GDP, the impact on actual prices is likely significantly smaller. What\u2019s more, the estimate assumes that all the savings from lower worker wages are passed on to consumers, and none of it is retained by employers in the form of higher profits, which seems very unlikely. Finally, his estimate assumes that adding millions of people to the country has no impact on demand for goods and services, which itself is inflationary.\nThe bottom line is that immigration does impact the wages of some American workers significantly \u2014\u00a0primarily the poorest and least-educated Americans. But the impact of the recent influx on overall consumer prices must be trivial, if there\u2019s any at all.\n",

However, this estimate is likely an overestimate and the actual impact is probably smaller. The analysis assumes that all savings from lower wages are passed on to consumers, which is unlikely. Additionally, the estimate does not account for the inflationary impact of increased demand for goods and services from new immigrants. The true impact of immigration on consumer prices is likely trivial or non-existent. The real concern is the significant impact of immigration on the wages of poor and uneducated American workers."

Pete Aguilar (D-Calif.), the caucus chairman for House Democrats, told HuffPost.\n\u201cA lot of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle decry immigration policies, yet their regions and industries that they appreciate benefit from immigrant labor,\u201d he said.\nThe CBO report, released Tuesday, largely\u00a0reiterated conclusions first disclosed by the office in June\u00a0in a small portion of its budget and economic update. But while that discussion was limited to only a few pages, the new report is more extensive.\nThe report compares estimates of how the economy and budget would be impacted by immigration rising by 8.7 million migrants from 2021 to 2026, CBO\u2019s current forecast, against how the economy and budget would do if the same pace of immigration as before the COVID-19-fueled surge \u2015 200,000 people a year \u2015 had continued instead.\nIt found that the increase in immigration would increase the size of the U.S. economy by about $8.9 trillion over the 2024 to 2034 period.\nA bigger gross domestic product would mean more revenues for the government, both directly in taxes paid by immigrants but also simply from more economic activity. That $1.2 trillion over 10 years would be slightly offset, though, by about $300 billion in additional federal benefits payments paid out to immigrants and their children, as well as economic factors like higher interest rates, the CBO said.\nOverall, that higher level of immigration would shrink the budget deficit by\u00a0$900 billion overall through 2034, the CBO said. While $900 billion is a large number, it\u2019s a tiny percentage of the\u00a0$22 trillion deficit the agency projects the government will run between 2025 and 2034.\nThe CBO analysis did not include so-called discretionary spending, the amounts set aside each year for federal agencies outside of Social Security and Medicare, or the impact of immigration on state and local governments.\nHowever, the CBO did say most studies have found that more immigration does lead to higher costs for state and local governments, as the costs for immigrants outpaces the additional money they add to the economy.\u00a0\n",

        "text": "Legal immigration is a boon to a free market economy. But what\u2019s happening now is not \u2026 that. \n\nBorder Patrol\u00a0agents have recorded at least 10 million illegal immigrants who have flooded the country since\u00a0President Joe Biden\u00a0and\u00a0Vice President Kamala Harris\u00a0took office. But that figure doesn\u2019t include the 2 million known \u201cgotaways\u201d and countless others who have evaded formal detection by law enforcement officers.\nIn addition to this being a human crisis, it\u2019s also an economic one. These illegal immigrants are not working enough.\nA recent study by the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank isolated Census Bureau survey data of prime-age immigrants without college degrees, the majority of whom recently arrived. Or, the Atlanta Fed concedes, are indeed undocumented. While the self-reported employment status of these immigrants has trended upward over time, annual hours worked have trended downward. The average immigrant in this category who has been in the country for two years \u2014 and do note that the majority of illegal immigrants who have entered during the Biden-Harris administration fall into this category \u2014 only worked 1,400 hours in 2022.\nThe issue has become embroiled in the presidential campaign, now in its final two months ahead of Election Day, Nov. 5. Former President Donald Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee,\u00a0laments\u00a0that the majority of new jobs created in the last two years have gone to illegal immigrants. Yet the larger problem is that at least half are likely living on taxpayer largesse.\nA little more than half of the prime-age immigrants without college degrees studied by the Atlanta Fed are in the labor force at all, compared to 5 in 6 Americans aged 25-64. Whereas the foreign-born population increased by nearly 4 million from July 2022 to July 2024, foreign-born employment only increased by 2.32 million. And when this recent influx of illegal immigrants do work, they\u00a0generate\u00a0lower labor productivity than previous waves of immigrants. So who\u2019s paying for these millions of unemployed? We are.\n\nFor the nation\u2019s most extreme example, consider California, which now offers illegal immigrants free (taxpayer-funded) health insurance, subsidized in-state tuition rates, food stamps for women, infants, and children, and possibly a new $150,000 handout for down payments on new homes, a proposal endorsed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA). Even before Medi-Cal coverage went into effect for California\u2019s undocumented population, illegal immigrants\u00a0generated\u00a0just $8.5 billion, according to the pro-immigration Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, in state and local taxes in 2022 but\u00a0cost\u00a0$22.8 billion, according to the immigration-restrictionist Federation for American Immigration Reform.\nThe chasm has likely grown, and even federal taxpayers are on the hook. National taxpayers foot the majority of the bill for Medi-Cal and all of it for the supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children. And so long as the IRS allows the state and local tax deduction, which was capped at $10,000 by Trump\u2019s 2017 tax reform, to exist at all, federal taxpayers are further funding benefits for illegal immigrants in states such as California.\nAll in all, the Center for Immigration Reform\u00a0determined\u00a0that 59% of illegal households used at least one major welfare program compared to 39% of native-born households. And all of this is before the dramatic escalation of direct spending from the Department of Homeland Security and localities to nongovernmental organizations and hospitality agencies to house, clothe, and feed swaths of migrants bused into anywhere from Times Square to Boston.\nThis nation was indeed built by immigrants who followed the laws of entry to take jobs, not handouts. While legal immigration is a boon to any economy with pending demographic doom as ours, illegal immigration influxes into a welfare state as fungible and flabby as ours come at a cost that we are not recouping.",

In California, illegal immigrants are eligible for free health insurance, subsidized tuition, food stamps, and other benefits, which are funded by taxpayers. According to one study, illegal immigrants in California generated only $8.5 billion in taxes in 2022 but cost $22.8 billion. Nationally, 59% of illegal households use at least one major welfare program, compared to 39% of native-born households. The influx of illegal immigrants is a significant economic burden on the country, and legal immigration is a more beneficial and sustainable approach."

        "text": "Maine Starts Paying Rent for Illegal Immigrants in Midcoast Town\nAs the\u00a0border crisis\u00a0continues to disrupt states across the nation, Maine has started paying rent for illegal immigrants in the midcoast town of Brunswick.\nMaine allocated nearly $3.5 million to provide apartments in five new buildings in Brunswick, about half an hour north of Portland, to 60 illegal immigrant families. All of the buildings will be available for occupancy by February, according to a December 2023\u00a0report\u00a0to the state\u2019s Joint Select Committee on Housing.\nThe construction was done through the Emergency Housing Relief Fund, which would also guarantee \u201crent payments for up to two years while households navigate the federal work authorization process and secure employment.\u201d Included in the large sum is beds and service coordination for the illegal immigrants.\nMaine Immigrant and Refugee Services (MEIRS) is also applying $100,000 from the fund to help illegal immigrants in Brunswick, South Portland, and Lewiston with filing their asylum and work permit applications. The money will assist illegal immigrant family members to \u201cwork together to support each other\u2019s goals and achieve long-term stability with the help of a bridging case manager/coach,\u201d the report said.\nIn 2023, the fund\u2019s support helped transform a South Portland property with 52 apartments, Avesta Housing\u2019s West End II, into a housing facility for illegal immigrants. For that project, the fund also allocated \u201cpayment of their rent for up to two years until they fully navigate federal work authorization rules and secure employment.\u201d\nThe 2024 budget for the emergency fund also afforded $250,000 to the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project in the Portland area, intended to support over 1,000 illegal immigrants, as an \u201cadditional grant to support expansion of legal assistance to asylum seeking households.\u201d\nCreated in April 2022 with $22 million, Maine\u2019s Emergency Housing Relief Fund Program has since grown to $55 million in value following additions in subsequent year budgets.\nMaine is one of the many states that has had to adjust to a surge in illegal immigrant arrivals because of the Biden administration\u2019s negligence on the border, which has seen 10,000 apprehensions per day over several days in December alone, the\u00a0Daily Mail\u00a0reported. As President Biden\u2019s approval rating continues to plummet, the border and inflation are two issues especially weighing on many voters, including moderates and Democrats.\nA December\u00a0poll\u00a0showed that 70 percent of voters, including 55 percent of Democrats, believe the administration should impose new restrictions to deter the flood of illegal immigrants into the country. Nearly 1 in 3 voters said immigration is one of the most serious issues for the country, after price increases and inflation.",

        "text": "Map Shows How Much Undocumented Immigrants Cost in Each State\nRecord numbers in illegal immigration have resulted in United States taxpayers bearing the burden of tens of billions of dollars going toward paying for migrants and their families.\nThe federal government is at a political standstill following\u00a0Senate\u00a0Republicans' rebuke of a $118 southern border bill claimed by advocates to be among the most comprehensive immigration reform in four decades. The bill included emergency powers for the federal government to deter migrants in large numbers, changes in asylum laws in addition to tens of billions in foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan.\nConservative critics singled out a particular provision requiring the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security\u00a0(DHS) to shut down the U.S. border only if migrant crossings exceeded a 5,000 daily average in a given week, deemed by House Speaker\u00a0Mike Johnson\u00a0to be a non-starter in his conference. Former President\u00a0Donald Trump, the front-runner for the 2024 GOP nomination, also expressed opposition.\nWith no new legislation in place and\u00a0more than 1 million migrant encounters\u00a0at the U.S. border since the new fiscal year began on October 1, states like Texas are leading the way in trying to enforce their own laws. Texas Governor\u00a0Greg Abbott\u00a0said deployment of his state's National Guard has\u00a0reduced daily encounters\u00a0from a couple thousand or more to less than a dozen per day.\nA detailed report published by the nonpartisan Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) details the number of illegal migrants in all 50 states, and how taxpayers individually and statewide are subsidizing such costs because of governmental inaction.\n\nCalifornia, Texas, Florida, New York and New Jersey had the most \"illegal aliens,\" as well as the most \"illegal aliens\" who also have children living in the U.S.\nThe tax burden for Californians far exceeded every other state, collectively costing residents about $22.82 billion, with the cost increasing to $30.93 billion when taking into account children.\nTexas, currently caught in a maelstrom with the federal government and President\u00a0Joe Biden's administration, has endured the second-highest cost, totaling about $9.94 billion and $13.36 billion, respectively.\nThe total net cost of illegal immigration on states and residents exceeds $100 billion.\nThe report was first published last March but is continually updated, according to FAIR President Daniel Stein.\nHe told\u00a0Newsweek\u00a0via phone on Friday that statistics composing the 91-page report are difficult to come by and take a long time to compute because each state has different systems in place, plus various lawsuits occurring nationwide to keep some data about immigrants clandestine.\n\n\"It's an intensive, laborious process because the states do not intentionally keep information, or are hiding it, if you will, to state taxpayers for these direct and indirect fiscal costs,\" Stein said.\nThe big challenge is that local and state taxpayers pay for the costs, though most statutes come from the federal level, he added, creating distance between \"those responsible for a policy and those paying for it.\"\nEven states that have\u00a0sent National Guard troops\u00a0to the border in support of Texas and Abbott are passing on costs to taxpayers.\nThe children associated with illegal immigrants refer to children born in the U.S. who are technically U.S. citizens, he added.\nStein has worked on the issue professionally for some 45 years, testifying dozens of times in front of\u00a0Congress. The issue of immigration has hit a \"fever pitch\" as of late that he said he hasn't quite seen before to the point in which average Americans are more educated than ever on issues like presidential powers, work authorization and asylum.\nIn the past, he said political pundits and policy makers believed they could \"buy off the public with sham solutions,\" citing the failed Senate bill this week.\n\"In a sense, Biden has shifted the entire debate onto a new center of gravity, onto a new hinge,\" Stein said. \"The Overton window has shifted and people are going, 'This is a serious issue and the entire balance of our society\u2014this cannot be sustained.'\"\n",

        "text": "Half of Americans call volume of immigrants a \u2018critical threat,\u2019 poll finds\nAmericans\u2019 concerns about immigration have risen sharply this year, with half of Americans saying that the large number of immigrants and refugees entering the country is a \u201ccritical threat\u201d to U.S. interests, up from 42 percent last fall to the highest level since 2010, according to a\u00a0poll by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. The poll found that most Americans support two proposals laid out by former president Donald Trump: using\u00a0U.S. troops to stop immigrants\u00a0from coming into the United States from Mexico and expanding a wall on that border.\nBut a larger majority of Americans oppose Trump\u2019s proposal to put undocumented immigrants in mass-detention camps. If elected, Trump\u00a0has pledged\u00a0to immediately launch \u201cthe largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\u201d\nThe Chicago Council poll comes as Trump tries to paint Vice President Harris, the Democrats\u2019 likely nominee for president, as responsible for illegal border crossings that have happened since President Biden took office. Harris was asked by Biden to oversee efforts to stem migration from Central America. Illegal border crossings soared during the Biden administration, then dropped recently because of factors including a shift in administration policy.\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s\u00a0first television ad of the general election\u00a0attacks Harris for failing to prevent millions of illegal border crossings, claiming this led to fentanyl deaths, crime and terrorism risks. The ad made\u00a0several misleading claims.\nA late July\u00a0Wall Street Journal poll\u00a0found that voters thought Trump would handle immigration better than Harris by 53 percent to 40 percent.\nChicago Council\u2019s poll found 50 percent of Americans say large numbers of immigrants and refugees coming into the United States is a critical threat to the country\u2019s interests, marking the highest level in Chicago Council polling since 2010, when it was 51 percent. Concerns over immigrants as a threat peaked at 60 percent in 2002, less than one year after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The United States has about 45 million immigrants, about 11 million of whom are undocumented.\nIn response to a separate question, 44 percent of Americans said immigration mattered \u201ca great deal\u201d in their decisions of whom to vote for in the presidential election. That ranked behind protecting U.S. democracy (59 percent), the economy in general (58 percent) and inflation (53 percent). Immigration was at about the same level as abortion policies (43 percent), a little above crime (39 percent), and well above the Russia-Ukraine war (19 percent) and the Israel-Gaza war (17 percent).\nRepublicans ranked immigration third in importance, with 69 percent saying it mattered a great deal, behind the economy in general (76 percent) and inflation (75 percent). About 4 in 10 independents said immigration mattered a great deal to their votes (41 percent), behind the economy (54 percent), protecting U.S. democracy (51 percent) and inflation (48 percent). Just about a quarter of Democrats said immigration mattered a great deal to their vote (26 percent), ranking below every issue but the two ongoing wars.\nLooking at specific policies proposed by Trump, 53 percent of Americans favored using U.S. troops to stop immigrants from coming into the United States from Mexico, an increase from 47 percent in 2023 and 49 percent in 2019. While support was highest among Republicans, half of independents and 3 in 10 Democrats supported sending troops to stop immigrants.\nA similar 55 percent of Americans favored expanding the 700-mile wall and fencing on the U.S.-Mexico border. That also is an increase, from 41 percent in 2019 and 48 percent in 2016. A wide majority of Republicans supported expanding the wall this year (89 percent). Independent support for the wall grew from 42 percent in 2019 to 53 percent this year. And while most Democrats opposed it, Democratic support for expanding the wall more than doubled from when Trump was in office in 2019, from 11 percent to 26 percent.\nBut mass camps for undocumented immigrants are widely unpopular. By a roughly 2-to-1 margin, Americans opposed detaining millions of undocumented immigrants in mass camps while they await immigration hearings, 65 percent to 33 percent. And while most Republicans supported it (57 percent), support dropped to 30 percent of independents and 18 percent of Democrats.\nThose findings were similar to an April\u00a0Pew Research Center poll\u00a0that found majority opposition to a national effort to deport undocumented immigrants, but majority support among Trump voters.\nHowever, a January\u00a0CNN poll\u00a0showed higher support for mass-deportation efforts, finding nearly half of Americans favored Trump trying to \u201cdetain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants\u201d if he becomes president again. About 9 in 10 Americans thought Trump would try to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants if he became president again.\nA separate question in the Chicago Council poll provided respondents with four options the United States could implement to manage undocumented immigrants. A majority said they should be allowed to stay in the country, including 29 percent who said they should be allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship and 26 percent who said they should eventually be allowed to apply for citizenship after paying a penalty and waiting for a number of years. Another 4 percent said they should be allowed to stay but not apply for citizenship, while about 4 in 10 said undocumented immigrants should be required to leave the United States (39 percent).\nAmericans expressed mostly positive opinions of immigrants on other questions in the survey.\nAbout 6 in 10 Americans said that immigrants from other cultures have a \u201cmainly positive\u201d impact on American society, including majorities of Democrats and independents. Most Republicans said immigrants negatively affect society.\nAnd roughly 7 in 10 Americans said illegal immigrants \u201cmostly take jobs that nobody wants,\u201d while about 3 in 10 said they \u201cmostly take jobs from Americans who need them.\u201d That\u2019s a significant shift from 2010, when the public split about evenly on whether immigrants took jobs from Americans or jobs that nobody wanted.\nDespite widespread immigration concerns, a minority of Americans overall want to decrease the levels of legal immigration into the country. One-third of Americans (33 percent) said that legal immigration levels should be decreased, roughly the same share as last year and down from 39 percent during Trump\u2019s first presidential campaign in 2016. This year\u2019s survey found a 44 percent plurality of Americans said legal immigration should be kept at present levels, while another 22 percent said legal immigration should be increased.\nThe Chicago Council on Global Affairs poll was conducted online from June 21 through July 1 among a national sample of 2,106 American adults with an error margin of plus or minus 2.3 percentage points. The sample was drawn through Ipsos\u2019s KnowledgePanel, an ongoing survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households.\n\n",

Everything will be impacted.\u201d\nOurs is a broken immigration system that rewards illegality while frustrating the attempts of those we most want to join us. The Southern border is a mess because the leading political parties\u00a0can\u2019t find intraparty consensus, let alone with their adversaries. The status quo that the border states have so long endured appears to be close to sundering, if only because the population centers that could pretend illegal immigration wasn\u2019t a problem no longer can. Acknowledging there is an issue is a vital step. Still, I have little confidence the nativists and libertarians on the right and labor and the internationalists on the Left can arrive at an effective solution. But one has to hope.\n",

Chicago has announced a $538 million budget deficit, with a significant portion attributed to the cost of caring for new migrants.

The city's services, including child services, senior services, and housing, will be impacted by the cost of caring for illegal immigrants. The US has a broken immigration system that rewards illegality and frustrates legal immigration attempts. The Southern border is a mess due to a lack of intraparty and interparty consensus. The status quo is unsustainable, and population centers can no longer ignore the issue of illegal immigration.

        "text": "The Case Against Immigration\nBy Roy Beck\nChapter One: A Nation of (Too Many) Immigrants?\nSince 1970, more than 30 million foreign citizens and their descendants have been added to the local communities and labor pools of the United States.(1) It is the numerical equivalent of having relocated within our borders the entire present population of all Central American countries.\nDemographic change on such a massive scale--primarily caused by the increased admission of legal immigrants--inevitably has created winners and losers among Americans. Based on opinion polls, it appears that most Americans consider themselves net losers and believe that the United States has become \"a nation of too many immigrants. What level of immigration is best for America, and of real help to the world? Although we often hear that the United States is a nation of immigrants, we seldom ask just what that means. It can be difficult to ask tough questions about immigration what we see nostalgic images of Ellis Island, recall our own families' coming to America, or encounter a new immigrant who is striving admirably to achieve the American dream.\nBut tough questions about immigration can no longer be avoided as we enter a fourth decade of unprecedentedly high immigration and struggle with its impact on job markets, on the quality of life and social fabric of our communities, and on the state of the environment.\nEfforts to discuss these questions alarm some business interests and others who support high immigration. They often express shock that Americans could consider violating what they claim to be the country's tradition of openness by cutting immigration. But they misunderstand U.S. history. It is the high level of immigration during the last three decades that has violated our immigration tradition. The anti-immigration tenor of the times is not nearly so much because Americans have changed as that immigration has changed.\nOver the long span of history from the founding of the nation in 1776 until 1965, immigration varied widely but averaged around 230,000 a year. This was a phenomenal flow into a single country, unmatched in world history. It should be noted that during large parts of that period, the United States--with vast expanses of virtually open land--was much better able than today to handle 230,000 newcomers annually. Suddenly in the 1970s and 1980s, at the very time that the majority of Americans were coming to the conclusion that the U.S. population had grown large enough, immigration soared above American tradition, averaging more than 500,000 a year. And it has been running around 1 million a year during the 1990s.\nUntil recently, policymakers and politicians of every stripe had ignored what public opinion polls found to be the public's growing dissatisfaction with the abnormally high level of immigration. Majority public opinion can be shallow, fleeting, and wrong, but an honest look at major trends during the recent mass immigration shows that ordinary Americans' concerns can hardly be dismissed as narrow and unenlightened:\n* Whole industries in the 1970s and 1980s reorganized to exploit compliant foreign tabor, with the result that conditions have deteriorated for all workers in those industries.\n* Long trends of rising U.S. wages have been reversed.\n* Poverty has increased.\n* The middle-class way of life has come under siege; income disparities have widened disturbingly.\n* Aggressive civil rights programs to benefit the descendants of slavery have been watered down, co-opted, and undermined be- cause of the unanticipated volume of new immigration. A nearly\u0160 half-century march of economic progress for black Americans has been halted and turned back.\n* The culture--and even language--of many local communities has been transformed against the wishes of their native inhabitants. Instead of spawning healthy diversity, immigration has turned many cities into caldrons of increased ethnic tension and divisiveness.\n* A stabilizing U.S. population with low birth rates (like other advanced nations) has become the most rapidly congesting industrialized nation in the world (resembling trends in Third World countries). Vast tracts of remaining farmland, natural habitat, and ecosystems have been destroyed to accommodate the growing population. Environmental progress has been set back by the addition of tens of millions of new polluters.\n* Numerous organized crime syndicates headquartered in the new immigrants' home countries have gained solid beachheads of operations. Law enforcement agencies have been confounded just as they thought they were near victory over the crime organizations that other ethnic groups had brought with them during the Great Wave.\nIt is common when discussing those negative trends to focus on individual immigrants, skills, education, and morals, their country of origin, culture, and race. If one side points out that some immigrants are prone to crime and destructive behavior, others note that most immigrants arrive with high motives, good character, and laudable behavior. Some observers fear that the volume of non-european immigration threatens to swamp America's cultural heritage; others welcome an ever more multicultural society. Nonetheless, the chief difficulties that America faces because of current immigration are not triggered by who the immigrants are but by how many they are.\nThe task before the nation in setting a fair level of immigration is not about race or some vision of a homogeneous white America; it is about protecting and enhancing the United States' unique experiment in democracy for all Americans, including recent immigrants, regardless of their particular ethnicity. It is time to confront the true costs and benefits of immigration numbers, which have skyrocketed beyond our society's ability to handle them successfully.\n* * *\nThe cumulative effect of years of high immigration has taken a while for Americans to comprehend. But in the 1990s, many Americans have awakened to a rather startling realization: The unrelenting surge of immigration above traditional levels is transforming communities throughout the United States into something their residents often don't like or quite recognize as their own.\nThe unprecedented flow of immigration has dramatically reshaped the social and ecological landscape up and down America's coasts, and it has spilled over into the hinterlands, carving new economic and cultural\u0160channels in the Ozarks Hills, Wisconsin's little northwoods cities, Atlanta's outlying towns, the Rocky Mountains, and the Kansas-Nebraska-Iowa plains. Millions of new immigrants now pulse through the economic arteries of most urban areas, from New York City to Dodge City, and of an increasing number of non-urban regions, from North Carolina fishing villages to North Arkansas mountain hamlets.\nNone of this has been inevitable. Legal immigration into this country has quadrupled over the traditional American level for only one reason: Congress and the president made it happen.\nLegal immigration could be stopped with a simple majority vote of Congress and a stroke of the president's pen--as early as next month, if they desired. Or it could be increased just as quickly. The volume of legal immigration is entirely at the discretion of Washington.\nNobody ever intended for such an onslaught when the immigration laws were changed in 1965; the huge increase in numbers was an accident. But for nearly three decades during various efforts to control illegal immigration, Congress stood by as the much larger legal immigration soared ever upward and as citizen opposition rose correspondingly.\nFinally in 1993 and 1994, a few lawmakers of both parties--but outside their parties' leadership--proposed major cutbacks (of two-thirds to three-fourths) in annual legal immigration. They shocked everybody, including themselves, by drawing almost 100 supporters from among the 535 members of Congress.\nThen, in 1995, more modest reductions (of about one-third) were proposed independently by two key Republican subcommittee chairmen, Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming and Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, and by a bi-partisan federal commission led by former Democratic congresswoman Barbara Jordan. President Bill Clinton endorsed the concept. The emerging centrist consensus, however, quickly drew strong opposition from several top Republican congressional leaders (especially free-market libertarians) and from the Democrats' liberal wing, all of whom wished to protect current high immigration levels or increase them.\nThe United States entered 1996 with Congress assessing the effects of the unprecedented foreign influx of the last thirty years and trying to determine how drastically annual immigration should be cut.\nDespite the loud outcry from immigration advocates that something draconian was being considered, a one-third reduction would leave legal admissions still near the level of the 1880-1924 Great Wave. Even after a one-third cut in 1996, the number of immigrants would be triple the average who entered during America's golden immigration era between 1925 and 1965. In that time of far lower immigration, immigrants enjoyed more popularity and a higher and quicker success rate than at any other time in American history.\nGiven the three decades of inertia that had made any rollback seem impossible, the leaders who proposed cutting legal immigration by around one-third have to be lauded. But they have approached the\u0160issue by starting with the current unprecedented immigration peak, determining that it is harmful to the country, and then asking what can be cut. If instead they were designing immigration policy based on what is best for the American people, they would start at zero and ask what level of immigration actually is needed by the nation. The final number in that exercise would be far lower-and far closer to what the American people most desire.\nThe country's grateful reaction to a cut of merely one-third might be similar to that of residents of a Mississippi River town after a flood has crested in the upstairs bedroom and then receded to the living room downstairs: \"Conditions arc improved, but we're still flooded.\"\nThis self-inflicted flooding of the past three decades has undercut ambitious efforts during the same period to create a society of more fairness and opportunity for all Americans. Strong evidence amasses that the levels of immigration after 1965 have eroded the country's ability to achieve some of its most cherished goals. Many politicians and pundits have said it is hyperbolic to suggest that the single phenomenon of renewed mass immigration could so negatively affect the country. But major demographic upheavals, like the Baby Boom after World War II, touch every aspect of a nation's fife and reverberate for decades. Certainly, the more than 30 million people added by immigration policy during the last three decades qualify as a major demographic phenomenon.\nThere have been many impediments to reaching some of our nation's highest goals. Immigration has not been the only cause--and not usually the major cause--of various societal problems. But research from numerous sources converges to show that the new massive volume of immigration has played an important.\"spoiler\" role in efforts to reach at least four of America's goals: (1) a middle-class society; (2) equal opportunity for the descendants of slavery (3) harmonious and safe communities; and (4) a protected and restored natural environment.\nA MIDDLE-CLASS SOCIETY\nToday, Americans live in a society of widening economic disparity, with an increasing gulf between poor and rich, and fewer and fewer people in the middle class. This is a reversal of our egalitarian dreams of a society in which all who were milling could find a job, and in which even those who performed the lower-skilled tasks needed by society would earn an income that could support a family in modest dignity.\nThe Council of Economic Advisors told the president in 1993 that \"immigration has increased the relative supply of less educated labor and appears to have contributed to the increasing inequality of income. . . .\"(2) That was consistent with a United Nations report on the effect of immigration on the industrialized nations. It concluded that immigration reinforces existing gaps between rich and poor.(3)\nNonetheless, immigration definitely brings some benefits to a nation. In fact, most Americans may have benefitted as consumers because the immigrants have kept the price of labor lower, which may have lcd to lower prices than otherwise would have occurred. But consumers also tend to be laborers drawing those depressed wages. According to the UN report, it is only for the upper crust that the financial benefits of immigration tend to outweigh the losses. And that serves to increase income disparity.\nWho wins and who loses? A glance through the roster of immigration winners quickly finds business owners who have followed a low-wage labor strategy. Land developers, real estate agents, home mortgage officials, and others who tend to profit from population growth are winners. Owners of high-tech industries have lowered their costs by importing skilled immigrants who will work at lower wages than college-educated Americans. People who can afford nannies, gardeners, and housekeepers have benefitted from lower costs. Americans who prize cultural diversity are among the non-financial winners. Others have won by having the security, prestige, or pay of their jobs enhanced by the high immigrant flow. That would include immigration lawyers, refugee resettlement agency personnel, officials of immigrant-advocacy groups, and educators and other social services employees who work with immigrants.\nUnfortunately, the roster of immigration losers is much larger and includes some of America's most vulnerable citizens: poor children, lower-skilled workers, residents of declining urban communities, large numbers of African Americans, the unskilled immigrants who already are here and face the most severe competition from new immigrants, and even some of America's brightest young people, who lose opportunities to pursue science-based careers because of some corporations' and universities' preferences for foreign scientists and engineers.\nAlso among the losers from immigration are all Americans who prefer to live in a more middle class and less economically polarized society. Under low-immigration conditions from 1925 to 1965, the United States enjoyed increasing egalitarianism. But by the middle of the 1980s, it had a larger gap between the rich and poor than could be found in any other major industrialized nation, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Nearly every community receiving substantial numbers of immigrants has experienced increased disparities among its population and diminished cohesiveness. Even many Americans who would gain financially from high immigration into their community have come to oppose it because of the changes it would bring; they don't want to create a community of rising disparities, even if they would make more money. Consider the recent examples of Clay County, Alabama, and Clay County, Iowa.\nIn Alabama, the county chamber of commerce helped organize business, civic, and educational leaders in 1995 to discourage an Arkansas corporation from using immigrant labor to expand its existing poultry-processing operations in rural Clay County. Asked if it wasn't a little strange to have a chamber of commerce opposing local economic and population growth, executive director Carolyn Dunagan said: \"I don't know about other place's, but here when it comes to a choice between quality of life and growth quality of life is the most important.\" The Clay County leaders acted out of two primary concerns: (1) The importation of immigrants likely would hurt the county's black workers, harming their already modest economic position; and (2) the impoverished, Deep South county was having enough trouble trying to create a cohesive culture out of its black and white residents, without adding foreign cultures and languages into the mix and contributing to a population growth unlikely to pay its own way.\nMayor Irving Thompson of Ashland, the county seat, told me that many townspeople believed the corporation was preparing to recruit immigrant workers in response to recent protests by local black employees over working conditions. \"The fear,\" high school history teacher Mark Tucker said, \"is that the next time black workers walk out over a labor problem, they'll be replaced by Third World workers.\" It is not a frivolous fear; replacing black employees--more than any other Americans--with foreign workers has become somewhat commonplace around the country under Washington's expanded immigration programs.\nIn Clay County, Iowa, the economic enticements were greater. An outside corporation sought a zoning change to allow it to start up operations in an abandoned plant in Spencer, the county seat. An enraged citizenry crowded into the high school fieldhouse in an emotional demonstration before the city council, winning unanimous approval to block the corporation.\nWhy would they kiss good-bye 350 new industrial jobs for the city of 11,000? In a word: immigration. The proposed operation was in an industry with a long track record of drawing foreign workers. Local advocates for the new jobs accused opponents of being racist. Opponents, though, noted that the community had freely embraced refugees over the years, and that their concern about an influx of foreign workers was that the experience of other cities showed an unacceptable change in a previously egalitarian way of life.\nThe most telling reason Spencer citizens gave for blocking the new jobs was: \"We don't want to become another Storm Lake.\"\nUntil the 1980s, Storm Lake--less than an hour's drive to the south--had been like a twin to Spencer: neighboring agricultural county seat, same size, similar history and economy, a shared bucolic, safe, midwestern lifestyle with excellent schools, and the same epic prairie sky of uninhibited expressiveness. But a corporation similar to the one just blocked in Spencer moved into Storm Lake and immediately began attracting foreign workers. The steady flow soon turned Storm Lake into one of the scores of new immigration hubs created by federal immigration mandates since 1965.\nThe unrequested changes to fife in Storm Lake followed patterns similar to those in many new-immigration cities. Overnight, Storm Lake schools were dealing with the cultural ramifications of a student body that now is one-fifth immigrant (predominantly Laotian and Mexican) and with the challenges of teaching in different languages. New facilities have been needed to handle the growing population of high-fertility foreign families with their low incomes and low tax payments. Some Storm Lake residents have lost their jobs to immigrants; more have seen their wages depressed because of the loosening of the labor market and the immigrants' lower expectations. The immigrants have tended to occupy housing units in higher densities than natives and have settled in enclaves, changing the character of neighborhoods and causing some elementary schools to be disproportionately filled with newcomers. For the first time, parts of town became undesirable in the real estate market based on which schools had high populations of students who didn't speak English. A community which previously had little reason to think in terms of haves and have-nots became a starkly stratified society.\nEspecially unsettling--but to be expected in a community of wide disparities, transience, and separate cultures--has been the deterioration in Storm Lake residents' sense of safety. The crime rate soared above that of the rest of Iowa. It is four times higher than crime in Spencer, its former twin.\nTo a visitor from a coastal city, where the national trend toward economic stratification has been visible longer, Storm Lake still can seem like a delightful place to live. But to those who knew the city before, the changes have been difficult to accept. \"It breaks my heart to see what has become of my hometown,\" said Mary Galik, a Storm Lake native who moved to Spencer.\nGiven a choice, there was nothing about the creation of sharp disparities in the Storm Lake population that Spencer's citizens wanted to risk duplicating. Even main street merchants did not oppose efforts to block the new industry. As business owners, they favored the new plant because it would have increased their retail sales, explained Bob Rose, program manager of the merchants' economic growth organization. But as parents and grandparents, the merchants did not look favorably on economic development that might endanger what they saw as Spencer's special midwestern small-town culture and quality of fife.\nNationally during the last two decades of high immigration, the richest 20 percent of Americans have enjoyed some economic improvement and the richest I percent have-reaped strong increases of income. But the average wage for most American groups has declined.\nNo scholar suggests that increased immigration is the chief culprit in America's overall decline in wages. The economist Paul Krugman, of Stanford University, says the obvious central cause of the disappointing economic conditions for the American majority since 1973 is the drastic drop in the rate of growth in output (productivity) per worker. But the experts are uncertain about precisely why productivity growth has dropped so low and stayed there.(4) Clearly, though, Congress picked a terribly inappropriate period of U.S. history to be increasing the number of U.S. workers through immigration.\nAt the same time immigration was snowballing in the 1970s, the labor market was being flooded with baby boomers who were reaching employment age and with a big increase in married women seeking jobs. Based on recent research by several economists, it would appear that the big increases in the labor supply probably contributed to the drop in productivity growth, and definitely worked against efforts to improve it after it did drop.\nResearch by the economist Paul Romer explains that the problem with a large increase in the number of workers is that it tends to result in a lower amount of capital investment per worker. It is the capital investment per worker, along with technology, that is the most important ingredient in increasing per capita output, according to Romer's study, published in the authoritative National Bureau of Economic research journal. Thus, immigration during the last two decades, by greatly increasing the labor supply, would seem to be undermining capital investment per worker, the very process that could send wages upward again.\nRomer's research flies in the face of today's immigration advocates, who insist that the federal government must continue to run a high-immigration program in order to boost the economy. Adding workers usually does increase the nation's overall economic output, but not by enough to improve the circumstances of the average worker. \"In fact, what the data suggest is that labor productivity responds quite negatively to increases in the labor force,\" Romer maintains. Looking across American history, Romer found that when the growth in number of workers went up (through high immigration and fertility), there was a decline in the growth of per capita output--just as has occurred during this latest time of high immigration and depressed wages.(5)\nStudies by Harvard's Jeffrey G. Williamson have found that during those same periods of high immigration, the United States became less of a middle-class society and experienced its highest degree of economic disparity--just as is happening during the current period of high immigration.(6)\nIt isn't difficult to see how an abundant supply of new foreign workers could retard wage increases. U.S. Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich fretted in 1994 that constant supplies of foreign labor have enticed many employers to continue relying on low-paid, low-skilled jobs, instead of making technological improvements and then training workers for more productive, higher-paying jobs.(7)\nA U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics study concluded that immigration was responsible for roughly half the decline in real wages for native-born high school dropouts in the fifty largest metropolitan areas during the 1980s. The study found that immigration accounted for 20 to 25 percent of the increase in the wage gap between low-skill and high-skill workers.(8) And economists Timothy J. Hatton and Jeffrey G. Williamson declared in 1994 that all standard mainstream. Economic models predict migration will tend to lower wages where immigrants settle.(9)\nBecause the United States has had a surplus of workers, even the profits of the small recent growth in per capita productivity have not been passed on to the workers. Krugman has noted that when the number of workers surges, \"the way that a freely functioning labor market ensures that almost everyone who wants a job gets one is by allowing wage rates to fall, if necessary, to match demand to supply.\" Most of the profits from recent increased productivity have gone to Americans in the top 1 percent of income.(10) According to the research of immigrant economist George Borjas, high immigration during the 1980s helped facilitate a massive redistribution of wealth--more than $100 billion a year--from American workers to the upper class.(11)\nThe trend in this country during the previous decades of low immigration had long been toward higher wages, less poverty, and a larger middle class. Beginning with the shortage of workers during World War II, more and more Americans found that the toil of their labor earned them middle-class status. The number of Americans in poverty declined for decades. That happy circumstance came to a halt in 1973. Except for minor variations, the number of impoverished Americans has been increasing ever since.\nThe United States now routinely violates what Washington policy analyst Norman Ornstein has concluded is an implicit, national bi-partisan compact. In words similar to Bill Clinton's during his first presidential campaign, Ornstein says the compact holds that \"if people play by the rules, working hard and doing their jobs, they will not have to five in poverty.\"(12) But his contention has become increasingly difficult to uphold as inflation-adjusted wages have declined for Americans without college degrees and even many with degrees.\nWhat to do about the millions of Americans mired in poverty or struggling just above it? \"The best way to help these young unskilled workers is through supply-side interventions,\" maintains labor professor Robert M. Hutchens of Cornell University. Initiatives that limit immigration of workers \"can promote an environment where academic underachievers have at least some opportunity for upward mobility,\" he adds.(13)\nNo studies suggest that halting immigration would immediately put middle-class wages into t-he pockets of a large percentage of today's poor. But America's poor and its working class are not among the net winners of an immigration policy that brings in people who can compete directly with them in the job market. If the nation desires a return to a more middle-class economy, it is difficult to understand why its government would allow more than a nominal flow of immigrants at this time.\n",

However, the author argues that this is a misconception, as the high level of immigration is a recent phenomenon that has broken with the country's traditional immigration patterns. The main issue is not the characteristics of individual immigrants, but rather the sheer number of immigrants. A cut in immigration levels is needed to protect and enhance the country's democracy and quality of life. The current high level of immigration has contributed to widening economic disparities, decreased wages, and increased poverty. Research suggests that immigration has played a significant role in undermining efforts to achieve a more middle-class society. To address these issues, the author argues that immigration levels should be drastically reduced to allow for a more sustainable and equitable society."

        "text": "The costs of illegal immigration are sinking cities\nDemocrats\u00a0like to avoid the topic of\u00a0illegal immigration, flooding the debate with rosy ideals of \u201csanctuary\u201d and acceptance. Their hope is that everyone loses sight of the real human costs that come with a massive surge in illegal immigration.\nThe illegal immigration\u00a0conversation\u00a0has recently turned to Springfield, Ohio, a city of 59,000 people. Springfield has been an immigration dumping ground for the Biden administration, which has sent 15,000 Haitian immigrants to it since 2020. Those Haitians are among the 309,000 who have arrived in the country and are protected from deportation by the Biden administration, which recently extended them temporary protections through February 2026.\nAs a result,\u00a0Ohio\u00a0has had to put aside $2.5 million just for two years of healthcare to deal with the rapid population increase, and the Springfield City Schools district now must spend 10 times what it was spending prior on translation services for Haitian students. The police department is also on edge due to the increase in Haitian drivers who aren\u2019t familiar with U.S. traffic laws.\nThe focus on Springfield, though, has turned to the fantastical Republican claims that Haitians are eating people\u2019s pets because that allows Democrats and liberal media to ignore the actual problem. The city\u2019s mayor dismissing the eating pets stories gets plastered all over news stories, but his\u00a0saying\u00a0that, \u201cOur safety services are overwhelmed. Our hospitals are overwhelmed. Our school systems are overwhelmed,\u201d does not.\nSpringfield is not the only city whose hospitals have become overwhelmed. Cook County, home to Chicago, is\u00a0spending\u00a0about $2.2 million per month on healthcare for illegal immigrants. That money still isn\u2019t helping Chicago keep up, which led to one illegal immigrant shelter housing a chickenpox outbreak. Denver can hardly keep up with food and shelter demands, much less basic health screenings. San Diego hospitals have been dealing with an increase in trauma cases,\u00a0redirecting\u00a0resources to provide trauma care for illegal immigrants falling off the border barriers in California while illegally entering the country.\nChildren are also being put last by cities dealing with illegal immigrants. Students in Brooklyn were\u00a0pushed\u00a0into remote schooling, which the COVID-19 pandemic showed provides no benefit to children, so that illegal immigrants could use their school gymnasium as a storm shelter. New York City high school soccer players had games\u00a0canceled\u00a0as illegal immigrants congregated on their field and refused to leave, with New York City police taking the illegal immigrants\u2019 side and allowing them to stay.\nIn all these cases, American citizens are being hung out to dry to accommodate illegal immigrants. That taxpayer money being used on illegal immigrant healthcare is taxpayer money that does not help citizens who paid those taxes. Every doctor and nurse treating an illegal immigrant is a doctor or nurse not treating someone who is in the country legally. These are not complex debates about how much immigration is good for the country and what the trade-offs may be. These are zero-sum games where time and taxpayer money go to people who are not in the country legally at the expense of those who are.\nYou can see this most plainly in California, where Democrats have made it clear they are prioritizing illegal immigrants over Californians. The state legislature has been considering bills that would\u00a0provide\u00a0unemployment benefits and phone\u00a0subsidies\u00a0that are for low-income residents to illegal immigrants. Money for those benefits and subsidies comes from the exorbitant taxes Californians pay, meaning either unemployed or low-income Californians are going to be left out of programs designed for them, or that Californians must part with even more of their hard-earned money to pay for the growing illegal immigrant population to join those programs.\nThis is the same California that has been\u00a0dealing\u00a0with a budget deficit after the pandemic exposed how unsustainable the state\u2019s tax and spending system is. It is also the same California that passed a bill that would allow illegal immigrants to receive state-funded home loans, again either depriving residents of those loans or leeching more money from residents to cover the additional new eligible applicants. The bill was\u00a0vetoed\u00a0by Gov. Gavin Newsom not because of how unfair it is, but because the program is broke and the state legislature has not allocated more funds to it yet. (Thank you, budget deficit).\nThe zero-sum nature of these massive surges of illegal immigrants is obvious to everyone, even the Democrats dealing with them. That is why, with the exception of California\u2019s progressive zealots, Democrat leaders have whined and complained about being forced to live up to their sanctuary city standards. After Texas began sending illegal immigrants to New York City, the Big Apple stopped complaining just long enough to start\u00a0shipping\u00a0those illegal immigrants it invited into the country to neighboring cities.\nChicago knows that there is only so much money to go around, which is why it is among the sanctuary cities begging for federal aid. Wealthy elitist liberals at Martha\u2019s Vineyard panicked when just 49 illegal immigrants were sent there from Florida. The community evicted 45 of them, with the ones who were allowed to stay\u00a0coincidentally\u00a0landing stereotypical immigrant labor jobs in landscaping and roofing.\nAsk the Democrats in charge of those cities, and they would probably privately tell you that they were supposed to stay in those small border towns in Texas they were originally swamping. Those towns of tens of thousands of people were supposed to shoulder the burden of illegal immigration while Chicago and Martha\u2019s Vineyard broadcasted how accepting they are as \u201csanctuaries\u201d for just a handful of illegal immigrants.\nIt was always unsustainable. After all, if New York City, with its population of more than 8 million people and its budget of over $112 billion, can\u2019t handle a few thousand illegal immigrants over the course of a year, how are Texas border towns such as Brownsville, Eagle\u2019s Pass, or Del Rio supposed to handle that same influx arriving every single month?\nThis is all before you get to the ultimate human cost. There have been multiple Americans murdered by illegal immigrants, murders that would never have happened if Democrats enforced basic border security provisions. Point this out, though, and you are met with lectures about how illegal immigrants don\u2019t actually commit crimes more often than Americans. The lives of people such as Laken Riley, brutally murdered in Georgia by a\u00a0known\u00a0criminal illegal immigrant, are erased and turned into statistics so Democrats don\u2019t have to acknowledge how completely avoidable these crimes are.\nIt is the same reason that Democrats in Chicago and New York City want to talk about how \u201ccruel\u201d Texas is for sending illegal immigrants to their cities rather than how many residents are being deprived of resources in those cities. It is also why Democrats want to talk about former President Donald Trump\u2019s accusations that Springfield\u2019s protected Haitian immigrants are eating dogs and not that those Haitian immigrants are flooding the city\u2019s hospitals and schools. The costs of illegal immigration are real and destructive, and Democrats will do anything to avoid talking about them other than fixing the problem.\n",

        "summary": "The city of Springfield, Ohio has been overwhelmed by the influx of 15,000 Haitian immigrants sent by the Biden administration, resulting in increased costs for healthcare, translation services, and police resources. The city's mayor has stated that their safety services, hospitals, and school systems are overwhelmed. Similar issues are occurring in Cook County, Illinois, where $2.2 million per month is being spent on healthcare for illegal immigrants, and in Denver, where food and shelter demands are not being met. In San Diego, hospitals are dealing with an increase in trauma cases due to illegal immigrants falling off border barriers. American citizens are being negatively impacted, with taxpayer money being diverted to support illegal immigrants rather than citizens who need it. In California, Democrats are prioritizing illegal immigrants over citizens, considering bills to provide unemployment benefits and phone subsidies to illegal immigrants. The state is already dealing with a budget deficit and unsustainable tax and spending systems. Other cities, including New York City and Chicago, are also struggling to cope with the influx of illegal immigrants and are seeking federal aid. The costs of illegal immigration are real and destructive, but Democrats are avoiding discussing the issue and instead focusing on Sanctuary City ideals. Ultimately, the human cost of illegal immigration includes American lives lost due to lack of border security and enforcement."

        "text": "The unprecedented migrant crisis worsens our housing shortage\n\nThe housing shortage looms large as our nation faces a critical presidential\u00a0election. Just last week, the National Association of Realtors released new\u00a0data\u00a0revealing home prices in the\u00a0United States\u00a0reached a record high in June 2024. It\u2019s no wonder, then, that housing costs are a top priority for young voters.\nUnfortunately, some in Washington, D.C., continue to turn a blind eye to a key factor exacerbating this crisis: Mass illegal immigration.\u00a0\nHouses have been in short supply since the Great Recession, when housing production steadily declined, especially the construction of \u201caffordable\u201d apartments, which declined by 4.7 million units from 2015-2020. However, housing demand has only increased, driving up the cost of living.\nAs of 2024, the U.S. was short somewhere between 4 to 7 million housing units. The shortage of affordable and multifamily housing is especially severe, as multifamily construction has declined since 2021, dropping 14%. Considering that incomes have not kept pace with rising housing costs, these increased costs are especially harmful to lower-income families seeking multifamily units.\u00a0\nAdditionally, rising production costs have disincentivized developers from building more multifamily units, worsening the problem.\nAdding to this dire situation is the massive influx of illegal immigrants to the U.S. since 2021. According to a Center for Immigration Studies report, the foreign-born population has increased by 6.6 million since 2021, with 58% of this increase coming from illegal immigration. This massive population influx has increased the demand for housing, worsening the existing shortage.\u00a0\nWhile this matter has been largely ignored by both parties, former President Donald Trump\u2019s vice presidential pick has led the way in addressing this underreported crisis. Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) recently said, \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to talk about the housing crisis in Ohio or across the country without talking about the immigration problem. When you let, let\u2019s say, 10 million or 15 million people into the country illegally, those people all need homes.\u201d\nWhile population growth does raise the housing supply over time by providing more labor, new construction cannot keep pace with the increased demand caused by mass immigration. Indeed, some estimates suggest immigration may increase overall housing demand by around 500,000 units per year. As a result, housing costs and rents have seen additional increases in areas most affected by mass immigration, such as Miami and Denver, which have struggled to deal with massive influxes of migrants since 2021.\nThe role that immigration plays in worsening the housing crisis is especially evident in the market for multifamily housing. Forty percent of those apprehended at the southern border arrived in family units, and these families are initially housed in migrant shelters, which are often gyms or hotels. In New York City last year, two-thirds of migrants in shelters were members of family units.\u00a0\nWhen these migrants are eventually forced to leave these shelters, they often seek out affordable apartments, competing with low-income American citizens at the bottom of the housing market and raising rents for the poorest renters in the country. Such consequences reveal the injustice of mass immigration, which benefits migrants at the expense of struggling Americans.\nIt is true that other factors contribute to the existing housing shortage, including land-use regulation, zoning, and not-in-my-backyard attitudes, all of which make it difficult to build new housing, especially multifamily units. Nonetheless, it is simply impossible for housing construction to keep pace with the influx of millions of low-income family units pouring across the southern border.\u00a0\nAs long as the Biden administration allows unchecked illegal immigration into the country, the housing shortage will worsen, and housing costs will rise.\n",

        "text": "Why California's surge in immigration is lifting our economy\nKamala Harris had no sooner replaced Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee than Donald Trump began bashing her over the number of immigrants coming into the United States, declaring that they had\u00a0driven countless American workers from their jobs.\nBut the data on U.S. employment and the economy overwhelmingly suggest a reality far more beneficial when it comes to immigration than the nightmarish vision the former president has put forth.\nThe\u00a0surge of international migrants\u00a0since 2021 \u2014 including refugees, asylum-seekers and others entering legally and illegally \u2014 has lifted the U.S. and California economies by filling otherwise vacant jobs, helping to keep job creation strong, growing businesses and pumping millions of tax dollars into state, local and federal coffers.\nPayroll taxes on immigrant workers have even helped\u00a0relieve pressure\u00a0on the nation's embattled Social Security system.\n\nThere are, of course, short-term public costs associated with acclimating so many new arrivals, plus government expenditures on education and health services for immigrants and their families, along with the political and social challenges. Many agree the current immigration system is flawed and chaotic. But from a budgetary perspective, the additional federal spending on immigrants is projected to\u00a0pale next to the increase\u00a0in revenues from the millions more people working, paying taxes and buying goods and services, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\nAnd more than a few economists say that, by easing the shortage of American workers as the U.S. population grows older and birth rates decline \u2014\u00a0particularly in California\u00a0\u2014 immigrants have played a large and positive role in maintaining a healthy, growing economy.\n\u201cThis is the hottest labor market that has existed in two generations,\u201d said Michael Clemens, an economist at George Mason University who specializes in international migration. \u201cThat means there have never been as many opportunities for immigrants and natives to mutually benefit each other through economic interaction in the last half century.\u201d\nWithout immigration, California\u2019s workforce would have fallen well short of its needs, especially since the high cost of living, soaring home prices and other factors have fueled a notable\u00a0outflow of population\u00a0from the state.\nFrom 2021 to 2023, the population of U.S. citizens 16 years and older living in California fell by 625,000, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, while employment increased by 725,000.\nOver that period, however, the unemployment rates for native-born and foreign-born Californians fell by similar levels \u2014 an indication that immigrants are not taking away American jobs.\nMoreover, the recent waves of migrants are filling lower-paying, more physically demanding positions that do not attract as many native-born Americans, at least not at the wages that are offered.\n\nAn important source of labor\n\u201cImmigrants are a really important source of the labor force for California, in the high end as well as in a lot of jobs that don\u2019t pay as well,\u201d said Hans Johnson, a demographer at the Public Policy Institute of California.\nSeparate\u00a0employers\u2019 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0show that more than 70% of the nearly 400,000 payroll jobs added in California between June 2022 and June 2024 have been in just two industries: social assistance, such as health services for the elderly and\u00a0child care; and leisure and hospitality, primarily hotels and restaurants.\nBoth sectors are heavily dependent on immigrant workers.\nEmployers in construction, another industry reliant on immigrant labor, also added thousands of jobs in that period.\n\u201cA lot of what we do is physical \u2014 you get on your knees. And Americans don\u2019t do that,\u201d said Tom Straus, owner of Straus Carpets. He\u2019s been in the flooring business in the Bay Area for almost half a century and has regularly hired Latino immigrants. \u201cThe work is excellent and strenuous,\u201d he said.\nAngie, 28, and her husband and their 6-year-old arrived in Los Angeles last October from a village in Oca\u00f1a, Colombia, about 375 miles north of Bogot\u00e1. They flew from Bogot\u00e1 to Canc\u00fan, Mexico, and from there to Tijuana. Then the family walked across the border checkpoint into San Diego, receiving provisional entry as migrants seeking asylum.\n\t\u201cIt was expensive,\u201d Angie said of the travel costs, money they borrowed from relatives. Given her uncertain status, she didn\u2019t want to provide her last name.\nAt the border, Angie got a \"notice to appear\" at immigration court in May 2025, and she can stay in the U.S. legally until at least then. But migrants have to\u00a0wait 150 days\u00a0after they formally apply for asylum before they can receive employment authorization.\nAngie began working almost immediately upon arrival, first at a clothing business. More recently she found work in housekeeping at a hotel in Los Angeles. Her husband works remodeling houses.\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019ve been blessed greatly,\u201d she said.\nAngie and her family were among some 3.3 million immigrants who arrived in the U.S. last year, after net immigration of 2.6 million in 2022, according to\u00a0estimates by the Congressional Budget Office. Those numbers are roughly triple the annual average in the prior decade. A similarly large number is expected this year, although immigration over the long haul is likely to return to around 1 million a year, experts say.\nNo one knows how many immigrants who arrive in California decide to stay here. Over the years, increasing opportunities in other states and California\u2019s high cost of living have made it less attractive as a final destination. The latest Census Bureau figures, for 2022, show that\u00a027% of California residents are foreign-born, about double the U.S. share.\nMost of the immigration increase in recent years has been driven by foreign nationals entering illegally, asylum-seekers and hundreds of thousands of\u00a0people from Ukraine, Venezuela, Haiti and other countries who entered under\u00a0humanitarian programs\u00a0and can apply for work authorization.\nSince 2021, U.S. border patrol officers have seen a surge of migrants from Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru \u2014 but also from countries such as China and India, whose citizens in the past had rarely sought to come through the southwest border,\u00a0Department of Homeland Security statistics\u00a0show.\nOver the last few years, about 6 in 10 people crossing unlawfully have been turned away, according to an\u00a0analysis of DHS data\u00a0by Clemens, the George Mason professor. Most of those who are detained and not expelled are released in the U.S., many because they have shown credible evidence of fear and a desire to apply for asylum.\nThen there\u2019s a whole other large group of people who enter unlawfully and are\u00a0never encountered by border patrol.\nWhat's behind the surge at the border?\nThese migrants are part of an unprecedented international movement of people to the U.S. and other rich countries. While some are fleeing political and economic crises, the relocation is actually less a result of bad conditions at home than of successful development \u2014 which brings better health, greater awareness of international options and more income for travel. That allows people to pursue opportunities for better lives in the more prosperous countries such as the U.S., experts say.\nAnd technological advancements in many parts of the world have made the journeys more possible. Mobile phones and social media give almost anyone anywhere the basic information needed to migrate.\nIn his recent trip to southern China researching international migration, UCLA professor Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda met with people in Yunan province who were preparing to immigrate to the U.S. by entering through Tijuana.\n\u201cThey saw it on TikTok, how to do it,\u201d Hinojosa-Ojeda said.\nThe primary magnet attracting record numbers to the U.S. is jobs. Though unemployment has edged up recently as a result of government efforts to curb inflation, there are still 10 job openings for every eight unemployed workers in the U.S., according to\u00a0government data. For most of the last 2\u00bd years the\u00a0U.S. jobless rate\u00a0has been at or just above 3.5%, the lowest since the late 1960s.\nAlthough the labor market isn\u2019t as tight in California, at 5.2% in June, the unemployment rate isn\u2019t far off historical lows for the state. And employers are still\u00a0adding thousands of jobs\u00a0a month, with some positions going to workers without legal status.\n\u201cThey\u2019re getting a worker. The only downside is if they get in trouble for it \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t often happen,\u201d said Jamie Wipf, operations manager at the International Institute of Los Angeles, a 110-year-old organization that helps refugees and other immigrants.\nThe nonprofit's job placement records show many new arrivals are employed as drivers, security guards, caregivers and warehouse workers. The vast majority earn minimum wage to about $20 an hour.\nWhere California immigrants work\nMany employers in California are reluctant to talk about immigration because of the sensitivities surrounding the politically charged issue, especially in this election year. The California Chamber of Commerce, California Business Roundtable and other industry groups declined to comment for this article.\nYet their member companies depend heavily on immigrants. Foreign-born Californians account for one-third of all workers at restaurants and warehouses; about 40% in home healthcare and child day care; almost 50% at trucking and lodging businesses; and 60% at services for landscaping and cleaning buildings, according to a Times analysis of 2022 Census Bureau data.\nAre their large numbers holding back wage gains?\nEconomists say there is some truth to the claim that a surge of working-class immigrant labor could put downward pressure on certain jobs, such as meatpacking and gardening. But\u00a0studies have shown\u00a0that immigration has had no significant negative impact on wages for American workers overall.\nGiovanni Peri, an economics professor at UC Davis, said large-scale immigration actually\u00a0boosts productivity\u00a0and demand for services, which in turn helps companies to grow and create jobs that are more likely to be taken by native-born workers, such as those in sales and management.\nIt\u2019s also well documented that immigrants have\u00a0higher rates of self-employment, whether that means working as an Uber driver, pushing a street food cart or launching an ambitious tech business.\nYaroslav Uchkin and his girlfriend, Ukrainian refugees, moved to Los Angeles in February after several months in the Bay Area, where they had stayed with a host family. They both have work permits. Uchkin has found part-time work as a fitness instructor; his partner works as a food server.\n\u201cI have some vision,\u201d Uchkin said of a business he\u2019s looking to start, making sports nutrition products. \u201cWhy I\u2019m here in L.A.? I love the place for energy. People love sports, they want to look better.\u201d\nUchkin and his girlfriend recently leased a one-bedroom apartment in Marina del Rey. The arrival of many new immigrants has helped reverse or, in L.A.\u2019s case, stanch the population loss in cities that saw a pandemic-related exodus of residents, according to a\u00a0study by Brookings Institution\u00a0demographer William Frey.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt the economy is better off because of immigration,\u201d said Christopher Thornberg, founding partner at Beacon Economics, a research and consulting firm in Los Angeles.\n\u201cAt one level, I understand people are nervous about folks coming here in an uncontrolled way,\u201d he said, noting that he fears the anti-immigrant drumbeat is getting louder and louder.\n\u201cBut our nation desperately needs people,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople have stopped having babies, and so many are going into retirement. And here we really have an opportunity to help our economy in the long run, and we are turning away from it.\u201d\n",

        "title": "Double the Federal Minimum Wage",
        "text": "Double the Federal Minimum Wage\nState and local governments are proving that higher minimum-wage standards are good for workers. Congress should take the lesson.\n\nOpponents of minimum-wage laws have long argued that companies have only so much money and, if required to pay higher wages, they will employ fewer workers.\nNow there is evidence that such concerns, never entirely sincere, are greatly overstated.\nOver the past five years, a wave of increases in state and local minimum-wage standards has pushed the average effective minimum wage in the United States to the highest level on record. The average worker must be paid at least $11.80 an hour \u2014 more after inflation than the last peak, in the 1960s,\u00a0according to an analysis by the economist Ernie Tedeschi.\nAnd even as wages have marched upward, job growth remains strong. The unemployment rate at the end of 2019 will be lower than the previous year for the 10th straight year.\nThe interventions by some state and local governments, however, do not obviate the need for federal action. To the contrary. Millions of workers are being left behind because 21 states still use the federal standard, $7.25 an hour, which has not risen since 2009 \u2014 the longest period without an increase since the introduction of a federal standard in the 1930s.\nAcross much of America, the minimum wage is set to rise again in the next few days. In Maine and Colorado it will reach $12; in Washington, $13.50; in New York City, $15. Workers in the rest of the country also deserve a raise. The time has come to increase the federal minimum.\nHouse Democrats\u00a0passed legislation in July\u00a0that would gradually increase the federal standard, to $15 an hour in 2025 \u2014 likely raising the real value above the peak value in the late 1960s \u2014 and most of the Democrats running for president have endorsed the legislation. Last year, only about 430,000 people \u2014\u00a0or 0.5 percent of hourly workers\u00a0\u2014 were paid the federal minimum. The share has fallen in recent years as state and local governments, and some employers, have stepped in. But a much larger group of workers stand to benefit, because they now earn less than the proposed minimum. The Congressional Budget Office estimated a $15 minimum hourly wage would raise the pay of\u00a0at least 17 million workers.\nAmong the beneficiaries: people who work for tips. Federal law lets businesses pay $2.13 an hour to waiters, bartenders and others who get tips, so long as the total of tips and wages meets the federal minimum. The legislation would end that rule; the same minimum would apply to all hourly employees. Opponents of the change argue customers will curtail tipping and workers will end up with less money. But eight states, including Minnesota, Montana and Oregon, already have a universal minimum, including for tipped workers, and restaurant workers in those states\u00a0make more money.\nCrucially, the legislation also would require automatic adjustments in the minimum wage to keep pace with wage growth in the broader economy. The current minimum rises only when Congress is in the mood. As a result, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has eroded by nearly 40 percent over the last half-century. A full-time worker making the minimum wage\u00a0cannot afford a one-bedroom apartment\u00a0in almost any American city.\nThe simplistic view that minimum-wage laws cause unemployment commanded such a broad consensus in the 1980s that this editorial board came out against the federal minimum in 1987, calling it \u201can idea whose time has passed,\u201d and citing as evidence \u201ca virtual consensus among economists.\u201d The old critique is still put forward regularly by the restaurant industry and other major employers of low-wage workers.\nBut evidence that any such effects are relatively small has been piling up for several decades. A groundbreaking study published in 1993 by the economists David Card and Alan Krueger examined a minimum-wage rise in New Jersey by comparing fast-food restaurants there and in an adjacent part of Pennsylvania.\u00a0It found no impact on employment.\nThis prompted other economists to test the standard theory. This year, the British government asked the economist Arindrajit Dube to review the results accumulated over the last quarter-century.\u00a0Mr. Dube reported\u00a0the sum total of the research showed minimum-wage increases raised compensation while producing a \u201cvery muted effect\u201d on employment.\nThe patchwork nature of recent minimum-wage increases \u2014 the rate rising in some jurisdictions while staying the same in adjacent areas \u2014 is offering new opportunities for research.\nConsider, for instance, the situation\u00a0along the New York-Pennsylvania border. New York State has been raising its minimum wage since 2016. On Tuesday, the legal minimum will reach $11.80 outside New York City. Pennsylvania, meanwhile, is among the 21 states where the $7.25 minimum remains in force. In September, researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that wages have climbed significantly in counties along the New York side of the state line, again\u00a0without a discernible difference in the pace of employment growth.\nFor most companies, the bill is relatively small, and it can be defrayed by giving less money to shareholders, or by raising prices. Opponents often argue minimum-wage increases will encourage automation, but the point is easily overstated. Companies constantly invest in technology: McDonald\u2019s is installing self-order kiosks across the United States, not just at places with higher minimum wages. And instead of replacing workers with robots, companies may choose to invest in technology that enhances the productivity of their work force.\nMore than doubling the current federal standard would be a significant change, and it is not without risk. It is possible that a national $15 standard would produce the kinds of damage critics have long predicted; the Congressional Budget Office puts the potential increase in unemployment somewhere between zero and 3.7 million people, essentially acknowledging the effects are unpredictable. Workers may be most vulnerable in areas where prevailing wages are relatively low. In California, for example, the minimum wage for large employers (more than 25 workers) will rise to $13 an hour on Wednesday. That is unlikely to cause problems in San Francisco \u2014 but the new minimum is quite close to the median hourly wage of $15.23 in the Visalia metropolitan area in the Central Valley. The federal minimum would apply to metropolitan areas like Daphne, Ala., and Sumter, S.C., where\u00a0the median worker earned less than $15 an hour in 2018.\nOne simple corrective, proposed by Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, would be to include exemptions from the $15 standard for low-wage metropolitan areas and rural areas.\nBut the successful increases in minimum-wage standards across a diverse range of states and cities suggest the broader risk is worth taking. The American economy is generating plenty of jobs; the problem is in the paychecks. The solution is a $15 federal minimum wage.\n",

        "text": "Higher minimum wages may increase homelessness\nWest Hollywood, home to the legendary Sunset Strip, now has a new claim to fame: It has the highest minimum wage in America.\nAt the beginning of July, the city\u2019s wage floor rose to $19.08 an hour, surpassing even Los Angeles and San Francisco. The predictable arguments followed, in the hallowed tradition of America\u2019s minimum wage wars.\nEmployers said they couldn\u2019t afford the higher payroll costs and would be forced to cut back on staff. \u201cIf we go out of business, that means workers will lose their jobs, too,\u201d restaurant owner Lucian Tudor\u00a0told the Los Angeles Times.\nProgressives retorted that, thanks to the minimum wage, vulnerable workers are finally able to enjoy a semi-decent standard of living.\nBoth these arguments can be true, of course: Even if employers pare their payrolls by firing some folks, the workers who keep their jobs may be better off. Balancing the interests of the two groups is a tricky business \u2014 especially because there\u2019s no agreement on even the basic question of how many jobs are lost to the minimum wage. Supporters of higher minimums can point to studies that seem to show only small effects or even\u00a0positive\u00a0effects. Opponents have their own studies showing significant job loss, as well as the common-sense observation that when the price of almost anything goes up, people will consume less of it. I won\u2019t rehash these arguments any further: You\u2019ve probably heard them and already formed a strong opinion. Instead, I want to introduce a new argument: that higher minimum wages may be contributing to homelessness, a problem that is, of course,particularly bad in California.\nThis suggestion comes from Seth J. Hill, a professor of political science at the University of California San Diego, who recently\u00a0published a striking analysis\u00a0of cities that raised their minimum wages between 2006 and 2019. He found that in these cities homelessness grew by double-digit percentage points. The effect was larger for cities with bigger minimum-wage increases, and it also appeared to get stronger over time. \nI\u2019ll confess, I was doubtful as I started reading this paper. For one thing, I already assume that minimum wage hikes cause significant unemployment, and I try to bring extra skepticism to research that flatters my opinions. For another, this paper is a preprint, not yet peer reviewed. For a third, homelessness seems to be spiking despite an incredibly tight labor market. And finally, I\u2019ve been convinced by policy analysts who argue that the main driver of homelessness is\u00a0the refusal of liberal cities to build enough housing. But when I actually finished the paper, the study seemed solid. Moreover, Hill\u2019s conclusions are plausibly modest. After all, the vulnerable people who are most likely to end up homeless \u2014 those with substance abuse or mental health problems, unstable family situations and so forth \u2014 are probably also the most likely to be let go when employers trim payrolls. And this effect doesn\u2019t have to be large to have a big impact on homelessness, because the number of homeless people is (thankfully) small relative to the size of the labor market.\nThere are currently\u00a018.5 million peopleemployed in the state of California and an estimated\u00a0171,521 homeless. A minimum-wage increase that saw 42,000 California workers lose jobs or hours would barely register in the noisy employment statistics \u2014 but if the people who lost wages also lost their housing, the number of homeless people would increase by about 25 percent. And this could conceivably happen even in a very strong labor market if the marginal workers who end up displaced simply cannot generate more than $16 or $19 in hourly value for their employers.\nNevertheless, I still have to square this result with my strong assumption that homelessness is mostly about an inadequate supply of housing, not the labor market. But one way to think about it is that a state with a decent economy, like New York or California, can probably get away with a certain number of costly policy mistakes that tend to increase the rate of homelessness. They just can\u2019t afford all of them at once without ending up with a crisis.\nAnother, more depressing way to think about it is that these policies probably tend to feed on one another.\nIn cities that make it hard to build, housing prices will soar, and politicians will be under pressure to raise wages to match. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t fix the problem because a housing market with too little supply is just a high-stakes game of musical chairs. All that those well-meaning politicians can do is alter who gets left out when the music stops. When it comes to higher minimum wages, the answer may well be the workers so vulnerable and close to the edge that they can\u2019t even afford to leave.\n\n",

        "summary": "West Hollywood, California has the highest minimum wage in the US at $19.08 an hour, sparking debate between employers and progressives. Employers argue that higher wages will lead to job cuts, while progressives say it will improve workers' standard of living. A new argument suggests that higher minimum wages may contribute to homelessness, particularly in California. A study by UC San Diego professor Seth J. Hill found that cities that raised their minimum wages between 2006 and 2019 saw a double-digit percentage increase in homelessness. The effect was larger for cities with bigger minimum-wage increases and grew stronger over time. The study's findings are plausible and modest, suggesting that vulnerable workers who are let go due to higher wages may end up homeless. A small increase in unemployment could have a significant impact on homelessness, as the number of homeless people is small relative to the labor market. The study's results are difficult to reconcile with the idea that homelessness is mainly caused by a lack of affordable housing. One possible explanation is that costly policy mistakes, such as high minimum wages, can exacerbate the housing crisis. Another possibility is that these policies feed into each other, with high housing prices leading to pressure to raise wages, which in turn contributes to homelessness."

Airline employees, call center workers, retail store employees, and bank workers work full time for some of the most highly profitable corporations, but many still earn poverty level wages. Workers\u2019 productivity has risen by over 70 percent in the last four decades, but our wages have only increased by 11 percent over the same time period.\n\u00a0\nAt a time when wage stagnation and income inequality hold back our families and our economy, the\u00a0Raise the Wage Act\u00a0will begin to reverse that cycle and raise pay broadly, especially for the most vulnerable member of the workforce. Specifically, the Raise the Wage Act of 2019 will:\nRaise the federal minimum wage to $8.55 this year and increase it over the next five years until it reaches $15 an hour in 2024\nAdjust each year to keep pace with growth of inflation after 2024\u00a0\nPhase out the subminimum wage for tipped workers, individuals with disabilities and workers younger than 20 years old.\nAccording to the Economic Policy Institute, this Act will deliver long-overdue raises to more than 1 in 4 workers, 90% of whom are over the age of 20. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour will give roughly 40 million workers a pay increase, which is nearly 30% of the workforce.\nBoosting pay puts money into the hands of workers who would in turn help create jobs from the growing demand. With more income, we can buy homes, cars and support small businesses in our neighborhoods, cities and states. Our entire country succeeds when we create good jobs with livable wages, empower working people through unions, and invest in our future.\nBy raising the minimum wage, we can ensure that working people are compensated fairly for their work, reduce poverty and income inequality, and help grow the economy. All workers deserve to earn a living wage so we can all live with dignity and respect.\nThe House of Representatives passed the Raise the Wage Act in July 2019 and now it is up to the Senate to raise the wages for low income workers and ensure the economy works for everyone, not just the 1%.

        "text": "Let\u2019s sever the minimum wage from inflation in WA\nTalk to anyone in our state about topics they are concerned with during this election year, and you will hear a lot about homelessness, crime and inflation. Another major concern is the cost of living. As much as homelessness is attributed to addiction, mental health and incarceration, it can be argued that its root cause is the cost-of-living crisis.\nAs the costs of goods, services and housing continue to rise, more people are pushed toward the margins. What if the increases, including inflation, are not economic phenomena as much as bureaucrat-mandated subscription services?\nThe Metropolitan King County Council recently\u00a0voted to increase\u00a0the minimum wage in unincorporated King County to over $20, citing cost of living. This new ordinance tethers future minimum wage increases to the rate of inflation. Washington\u2019s state minimum wage law also includes this provision.\u00a0\nIn 2018, Seattle Times columnist Gene Balk, aka The FYI Guy,\u00a0wrote an article\u00a0using data collected from the Consumer Price Index showing Seattle\u2019s cost of living outpaced every major municipal region in the country. This was significant because four years earlier, Seattle had begun to raise its minimum wage by 60%. This data was captured before most other cities and states adopted Seattle\u2019s wage experiment, revealing the wage hike\u2019s implications in real time. In 2013, then-Seattle City Council member Kshama Sawant started pitching a citywide $15 minimum wage, promising the wage hike would\u00a0lift 100,000 workers out of poverty. Last year, Sawant claimed on \u201cThe Chris Hedges Report\u201d that\u00a0$25 an hour is needed.\u00a0\nAs the saying goes, \u201cWhen your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.\u201d\nSince Initiative 1433 was enacted in 2016, the state has seen eight consecutive annual minimum wage hikes and is certainly getting a ninth in January. Even though Washington\u2019s minimum wage has gone above $15 per hour to the current $16.28, the state\u2019s Department of Labor and Industries is mandated to increase the wage each year based on inflation. As a result of this vicious cycle, we will never be able to combat the cost of living with minimum wage.\u00a0\n\nAs minimum wage goes up, so does the cost of living via higher prices. The increased cost of living pushes more people toward homelessness. The government then increases spending on services and shelter. This government spending creates inflation. Labor and Industries has to work this inflation into a function that increases the state\u2019s minimum wage. This creates a mobius loop of out-of-control cost-of-living increases that exacerbate homelessness, crime and inflation. In other words, the government is telling the private sector to fix the problems the government caused. By tethering the minimum wage increases to inflation, the solution actually contributes to the problem.\u00a0\nI propose we sever the state\u2019s minimum wage from the rate of inflation and put these increases back into the hands of the people and their elected officials. Let\u2019s give our small businesses time to heal. Let\u2019s stop pricing our least-skilled citizens out of the job market. We can restore competition for businesses and give tax dollars back to the cities and counties and drive down the cost of living.\u00a0\nKing County\u2019s increased minimum wage decision has demonstrated how individual municipalities and counties can make their own decisions. Other counties may find an advantage in attracting businesses and tax dollars by keeping their minimum wage at a more competitive level. Washington\u2019s one-size-fits-all policy essentially removes the ability of cities and counties to utilize this advantage. When it comes to bringing back affordability to our state, we have many tools at our disposal, not just a hammer.\n",

        "text": "Make Social Security the Model to Fix\u00a0the Minimum Wage\nBoth Democrats and Republicans favor raising the federal rate from the current $7.25 an hour. Just indexing the new level to inflation would be a mistake.\nOne of the few things Democrats and Republicans agree on these days is that it\u2019s past time to raise the federal minimum wage, which has been stuck at $7.25 an hour for 15 years. Vice President Kamala Harris supported President Joe Biden\u2019s effort at the beginning of his administration to increase it to $15. Donald Trump\u2019s running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, supports Republican legislation to raise it to $11.\nNeither side is making a politically risky bet here, as raising the minimum wage is very popular policy. Of the 28 times referendums to raise it were on the ballot in\u00a0statewide elections\u00a0since 1996, they passed 26 times (the two losses were both in 1996). More than 75% of Americans think the current rate\u00a0is too low, and the majority support a minimum wage of\u00a0at least $15, with many supporting a floor of\u00a0at least $20.\nThe debate often neglects a critical part, which is whether and how to index the wage to some benchmark so that it updates automatically. Many would assume something pegged to inflation would be a victory. In fact, it would be a little underhanded. A better model would be how we calculate Social Security benefits.\nMost of the discussion focuses on what the minimum should be increased to. One idea would be to make it a percentage of the median wage. Before the start of the century, the inflation-adjusted minimum wage was about 50% of the median, peaking at 57%. That suggests it should be $12 to $13 now. Another idea is to make it some percentage of the average wage of production and non-supervisory workers, a category that excludes most managers. By that measure, the minimum wage used to be about 42%, peaking at 53%, suggesting it should be $12.50 to $14.50.\nThe problem with those approaches is that they fail to recognize that the bottom and middle of the labor market are simply not the same from a wage -setting perspective, and they don\u2019t fare the same in recessions or in tight labor markets. Rather than link the minimum wage to the middle, link it to the bottom. Here, the minimum wage has been about 80% of the 20th percentile wage, peaking at 90%. That suggests the minimum wage should be $13 to $14.50.\nYet another idea is to think of the minimum wage as a way to guarantee some minimum standard of living. To keep a family of four out of poverty based on official thresholds, it would need to be just under $15. To provide a living wage, or one to afford basic necessities such as housing, transportation, health care, food and utilities, it would have to be much higher. Even a single-person household in Mississippi, a relatively low-cost state, would need\u00a0$20\u00a0an hour in that case. Hence, a meaningful floor would put the minimum to at least $12, but ideally closer to $15. A standard-of-living floor requires at least $15 and up to $20. (It speaks to just how much the minimum wage has been neglected that the current rate of $7.25 can fit within the range of what the increase should be.) Whatever number Congress might land on, it\u2019s even more important that the new minimum wage be indexed. It has always been set in nominal terms; its peak value is the first day it is in effect and then slowly erodes over time as it loses value relative to rising prices.\u00a0Rather than wait for Congress to update it, indexing automatically increases the wage.\nThis is where the stakes get high.\nThe default assumption would be to index the wage to inflation so that it grows with prices.\u00a0Although the Republicans\u2019 Higher Wages for American Workers Act proposes a paltry increase to $11 by 2028, it does\u00a0include an\u00a0automatic price adjustment\u00a0every two years based on inflation. The problem is wages and prices don\u2019t move in lockstep, so wages should be indexed with wages and prices indexed with prices. Why? Wages rise faster than prices. A nominal, or non-indexed, dollar amount can erode relative to prices, but a real, or price-indexed, dollar amount can erode relative to wages.\nThis is a lesson that policymakers know well \u2014 at least in theory. The official poverty threshold suffers from the price problem. It is based on a 1963 estimate of need that was adopted as the\u00a0official threshold\u00a0of poverty and increased each year based on the Consumer Price Index. Even though the threshold was updated, it still eroded. So low has this cutoff fallen that public programs now use multiples of poverty for eligibility, rather than poverty itself, and after 20 years of deliberating and advocating, poverty researchers have gotten an alternative measure of\u00a0poverty into officialdom, and use this to\u00a0actually\u00a0measure poverty.\n\nSocial Security does not suffer from the price problem. When individuals apply, their highest 35 years of earnings are averaged to form the basis of their benefit calculation. The older earnings are adjusted into today\u2019s dollars using a wage index, not a price index. And each year, Social Security\u2019s tax cap is increased using that same wage index.\nThe labor market offers a lot of natural suggestions for how to set the minimum wage, and whether it\u2019s $12 or $15 or $20 really depends on how it\u2019s conceptualized, whether it should reflect labor market trends or sets them, and whether it\u2019s truly minimal or aspirational. But there is no nuance to the choice of index. Pegging the minimum wage to prices is another way for it to erode; it\u2019s making the same mistake a different way. Policymakers know not to make that mistake for Social Security, and they should apply the lesson to the minimum wage.\n",

Missouri should vote to fix it | Opinion\nWhat if I told you that with just a pen, you could improve the health outcomes of your community, decrease the divorce rate and improve the economy? Not only can you do this with a pen, but the hope is that you can do this this Nov. 5, 2024, between the hours of 6 a.m. and 7 p.m. at your local Missouri polling location. In May, Missourians for Healthy Families and Fair Wages turned in 210,000 signatures for a ballot measure that would increase the minimum wage from $12.30 to $13.75 by January 2025 and then to $15 in 2026. The measure would also provide Missouri workers one hour of sick leave per 30 hours worked. I am one of the 210,000 Missourians who signed, and I spent a Saturday morning volunteering to gather signatures.\n\nIf the measure is passed, it would provide raises to over 562,000 Missouri workers. That is enough people to fill Arrowhead Stadium just over seven times. Most workers making minimum wage in Missouri are over 20 years old. It would mean 1 in 4 Missouri children and 1 in 3 Missouri workers could benefit from access to paid sick leave. But what does raising the minimum wage have to do with my opening question? Studies have shown that raising the minimum wage can have positive outcomes on health. There are associations between increased wages and decreased hypertension, better birth outcomes and increased leisure time. A study on the impact of raising the minimum wage on divorce rates showed that a $1 increase in the minimum wage can reduce the divorce rate by 7-15% one to two years later. Poorer people are less likely to get married and five times more likely to have children out of wedlock. They are also twice as likely to get divorced. Raising the minimum wage would boost Missouri\u2019s economy by increasing consumer activity. Inflation has significantly reduced the buying power of the minimum wage. According to the Clark-Fox Policy Institute at Washington University in St. Louis, a Missouri family consisting of two adults and two children needs both adults to make $22.89 an hour to support their family. Even living in the one of the least expensive counties in the state, St, Francois County, that same family of four would need an annual income of $65,226, or roughly $16.99 an hour each. One argument against raising the minimum wage is that it would increase unemployment. However, the last time a phased increase of the minimum wage was passed, the unemployment rate in Missouri went down by a rate higher than the national average. In 2018, 62% of Missouri voters voted yes on Proposition B to raise the minimum wage. In 2021, Gov.Mike Parson called for the minimum wage for state government employees to be raised to $15. Parson recognized that increasing wages was the answer to the issue of turnover among state employees. Unfortunately, Parson has not been able to make this a reality. However, you might have the opportunity to make it happen for him by voting to increase the minimum wage for all Missouri workers. If the federal minimum wage had been growing in step with national productivity growth, as it did in the past, it would would be $24 an hour today. Signatures for this ballot initiative will be verified in August. If it makes it onto the ballot for November, you must do your duty as a Missourian to vote to increase the minimum wage . \n",

The changes take effect in early November.\nAll told, Sam\u2019s Club says the new model \u201caccelerates pay for nearly 100,000 frontline associates and provides a roadmap for them to plan and pursue more predictable, longer-term financial futures.\u201d\nHow the compensation model is different\nTo get more granular, the company\u2019s new model includes a plan to accelerate hourly wage growth, with wages growing between 3% and 6% annually, depending on a worker\u2019s duration with the company.\nThat means associates will reach the maximum pay rate for their given position quicker than before. So, if an associate\u2019s pay range was between $15 and $22 per hour, they\u2019d reach the $22 per hour level faster under the new plan, whereas it may have taken years longer under the old model.\nFurther, Sam\u2019s Club expects hourly rates for associates to clock in at more than $19 per hour, with bonuses available, too. Currently,\u00a0data from Payscale\u00a0shows that Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s average hourly rate is slightly more than $16.\u00a0\n\u201cAt Sam\u2019s Club, we believe delivering an unparalleled experience for our members starts with investing in our frontline associates,\u201d said Chris Nicholas, president and CEO of Sam\u2019s Club, in a press release shared with\u00a0Fast Company.\u00a0\n\u201cUntil now, retail compensation has largely been about hourly wages, and it\u2019s almost unheard of to talk about frontline associate compensation in terms of a predictable financial future\u2014that changes for Sam\u2019s Club starting today,\u201d he continued. \u201cOur new approach is one step in a series of investments we\u2019ve made in our people over the last several years, all designed to provide more meaningful jobs and build successful teams.\u201d\nHow retail wages measure up\nOverall, the average retail worker (of all stripes) earns almost $25 per hour, according to\u00a0data from the St. Louis Fed. So, Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s new model helps get its massive workforce closer to that figure. And with workers in some states\u2014notably,\u00a0fast food workers in California\u2014earning at least $20 per hour, the model may help the retailer better compete for talent.\u00a0\nAs for what it means for consumers who may be worried that the costs will be handed down to them in the form of price increases, it\u2019s difficult to say.\u00a0There is evidence\u00a0that minimum wage increases are tied to higher prices\u2014but not by much. So, it may be a wash: More money gets into associates\u2019 pockets, with modest possible price increases.\u00a0\nThe company\u2019s \u201cstrategic investments in employees and their work have already fueled productivity, increased sales, and built record membership rates,\u201d said Zeynep Ton, professor of the practice in the Operations Management Group at MIT Sloan School of Management and cofounder and president of The Good Jobs Institute, in comments included in Sam\u2019s Club\u2019s release. \u201cNow, they are continuing to enhance the retail experience for both employees and customers.\u201d\n\n\n",

A Burger King franchisee who runs 140 locations\u00a0said\u00a0he was installing self-ordering kiosks to reduce staffing levels while El Pollo Loco\u00a0said\u00a0it was automating more of its salsa-making.\nAll told, restaurants cut 9,500 jobs ahead of the wage hike,\u00a0according\u00a0to\u00a0an April analysis from the Hoover Institution. That does not count those that have come in subsequent months, after the new wage had fully kicked in.\nMeanwhile, the price of fast food\u00a0has\u00a0gone up\u00a0\u2014 Wendy\u2019s by 8 percent, Chipotle by 7.5 percent, and Taco Bell by 3 percent.\nWhile the media like to portray fast-food chains as major multinational corporations, the reality is that many locations are owned by franchisees that operate more like small businesses.\n\u201cWe have looked at price, although I can\u2019t charge $20 for a Happy Meal,\u201d an owner of 18 California McDonald\u2019s locations\u00a0said\u00a0to CNN. \u201cMy customers\u2019 appetite to absorb menu board prices is not unlimited.\u201d\nCalifornia, despite its incredible natural resources and the presence of the tech industry, currently leads the nation with a\u00a05.3 percent\u00a0unemployment rate\u00a0\u2014 up from\u00a04.7 percent\u00a0in September, when Newsom signed the minimum-wage hike into law.\u00a0This cannot all be attributed to the minimum-wage hike but does speak to the failure of the oppressive tax and regulatory environment in California that has made doing business there so difficult. Florida, in contrast, has a\u00a03.3 percent\u00a0unemployment rate.\nJust don\u2019t expect the disastrous results of the minimum-wage hike to convince the state to take a new approach. This November, there is a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage on all other workers to $18 per hour, and\u00a0polling\u00a0suggests\u00a0it is supported by an overwhelming majority of voters.\nWe suspect it won\u2019t be long before Californians are welcoming their new robot overlords.\n",

Despite Governor Gavin Newsom's claims of \"fairer wages\" and \"better working conditions,\" thousands of workers are now unemployed. Rubio's Coastal Grill filed for bankruptcy, citing the minimum wage increase as a reason. The move follows reports of layoffs in the fast-food industry prior to the wage hike. Major franchisees, such as Pizza Hut and Burger King, have announced layoffs and automation plans. Restaurants cut 9,500 jobs ahead of the wage hike, with more expected. The price of fast food has also increased, with Wendy's, Chipotle, and Taco Bell raising prices by up to 8%. Many fast-food locations are owned by franchisees that operate like small businesses, making it difficult to absorb the increased labor costs. California's unemployment rate has risen to 5.3%, compared to 3.3% in Florida. A ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage to $18 per hour is likely to pass, despite the disastrous results of the current wage hike."

        "text": "Benefits of Renewable Energy Over Fossil Fuels\nEnergy\u00a0is at the heart of the climate challenge \u2013 and key to the solution.\nA large chunk of the greenhouse gases that blanket the Earth and trap the sun\u2019s heat are generated through energy production, by burning fossil fuels to generate electricity and heat.\nFossil fuels, such as coal, oil and gas, are by far\u00a0the largest contributor to global climate change, accounting for over 75 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions and nearly 90 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions.\nThe science is clear: to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, emissions need to be reduced by almost half by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050.\nTo achieve this, we need to end our reliance on fossil fuels and invest in alternative sources of energy that are clean, accessible, affordable, sustainable, and reliable.\nRenewable energy sources \u2013 which are available in abundance all around us, provided by the sun, wind, water, waste, and heat from the Earth \u2013 are replenished by nature and emit little to no greenhouse gases or pollutants into the air.\nFossil fuels still account for more than 80 percent of\u00a0global energy production, but cleaner sources of energy are gaining ground. About\u00a029 percent of electricity\u00a0currently comes from renewable sources.\nHere are\u00a0five reasons why accelerating the transition to clean energy is the pathway to a healthy, livable planet\u00a0today and for generations to come.\n1. Renewable energy sources are all around us\nAbout\u00a080 percent\u00a0of the global population lives in countries that are net-importers of fossil fuels -- that\u2019s about 6 billion people who are dependent on fossil fuels from other countries, which makes them vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and crises.\nIn contrast, renewable energy sources are available in all countries, and their potential is yet to be fully harnessed. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) estimates that\u00a090 percent of the world\u2019s electricity\u00a0can and should come from renewable energy by 2050.\nRenewables offer a way out of import dependency, allowing countries to diversify their economies and protect them from the unpredictable price swings of fossil fuels, while driving inclusive economic growth, new jobs, and poverty alleviation.\n\u00a0\n2.\u00a0Renewable energy is cheaper\nRenewable energy actually is the\u00a0cheapest power option\u00a0in most parts of the world today. Prices for renewable energy technologies are dropping rapidly. The cost of electricity from solar power fell by 85 percent between 2010 and 2020. Costs of onshore and offshore wind energy fell by 56 percent and 48 percent respectively.\nFalling prices make renewable energy more attractive all around \u2013 including to low- and middle-income countries, where most of the additional demand for new electricity will come from. With falling costs, there is a real opportunity for much of the new power supply over the coming years to be provided by low-carbon sources.\nCheap electricity from renewable sources could provide\u00a065 percent\u00a0of the world\u2019s total electricity supply by 2030. It could decarbonize 90 percent of the power sector by 2050, massively cutting carbon emissions and helping to mitigate climate change.\nAlthough solar and wind power costs are expected to remain higher in 2022 and 2023 then pre-pandemic levels due to general elevated commodity and freight prices,\u00a0their competitiveness actually improves\u00a0due to much sharper increases in gas and coal prices, says the International Energy Agency (IEA).\n\u00a0\n3. Renewable energy is healthier\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about\u00a099 percent of people\u00a0in the world breathe air that exceeds air quality limits and threatens their health, and more than 13 million deaths around the world each year are due to avoidable environmental causes, including air pollution.\nThe unhealthy levels of fine particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide originate mainly from the burning of fossil fuels. In 2018, air pollution from fossil fuels caused $2.9 trillion in\u00a0health and economic costs, about $8 billion a day.\nSwitching to clean sources of energy, such as wind and solar, thus helps address not only climate change but also air pollution and health.\n\u00a0\n4. Renewable energy creates jobs\nEvery dollar of investment in renewables\u00a0creates three times\u00a0more jobs than in the fossil fuel industry. The IEA estimates that the transition towards net-zero emissions will lead to an\u00a0overall increase in energy sector jobs: while about 5 million jobs in fossil fuel production could be lost by 2030, an estimated 14 million new jobs would be created in clean energy, resulting in a net gain of 9 million jobs.\nIn addition, energy-related industries would require a further 16 million workers, for instance to take on new roles in manufacturing of electric vehicles and hyper-efficient appliances or in innovative technologies such as hydrogen. This means that a total of more than 30 million jobs could be created in clean energy, efficiency, and low-emissions technologies by 2030.\nEnsuring\u00a0a just transition, placing the needs and rights of people at the heart of the energy transition, will be paramount to make sure no one is left behind.\n\u00a0\n5. Renewable energy makes economic sense\nAbout\u00a0$7 trillion\u00a0was spent on subsidizing the fossil fuel industry in 2022, including through explicit subsidies, tax breaks, and health and environmental damages that were not priced into the cost of fossil fuels.\nIn comparison, about\u00a0$4.5 trillion\u00a0a year needs to be invested in renewable energy until 2030 \u2013 including investments in technology and infrastructure \u2013 to allow us to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\nThe upfront cost can be daunting for many countries with limited resources, and many will need financial and technical support to make the transition. But investments in renewable energy will pay off. The reduction of pollution and climate impacts alone could save the world up to\u00a0$4.2 trillion\u00a0per year by 2030.\nMoreover, efficient, reliable renewable technologies can create a system less prone to market shocks and improve resilience and energy security by diversifying power supply options.\n",

Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are clean, accessible, and abundant, and can help reduce emissions. Currently, about 29% of electricity comes from renewable sources, but this needs to increase to 90% by 2050. Five reasons to accelerate the transition to clean energy include its abundance, lower cost, health benefits, job creation, and economic sense. Renewable energy sources are available everywhere, reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels. The cost of renewable energy is decreasing rapidly, making it a more attractive option. Switching to clean energy can also improve air quality and health, and create new job opportunities. Investing in renewable energy can also pay off in the long run, saving up to $4.2 trillion per year by 2030.

Solar alone added more than 18,400 jobs, a 5.3% gain year over year.\nOnshore oil and gas activities posted the largest gains within the fuels sector, adding 9,028 jobs, while mining and extraction jobs remained flat with a growth rate of 0.4%.\nThe report outlined job gains in all 50 states, spurred in part by incentives in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and President Biden's signature climate law enacted in 2022, also known as the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden administration officials touted the incentives as drivers of the expansion in renewable energy.\nNotably, red-leaning states have\u00a0disproportionately benefited\u00a0from the Inflation Reduction Act's clean energy investments so far. The states that saw the fastest rate of clean energy job growth in 2023 \u2014 Texas and Idaho \u2014 were also ones whose lawmakers mostly voted against the climate law. Still, clean energy provisions have gained support among some Republicans in the two years since the law was enacted, as\u00a0Politico\u00a0reported.\nZaidi also highlighted the growth in unionization rates in the report, with the clean energy unionization rate at 12.4%. This surpassed the average unionization rate in the energy sector, though jobs were largely concentrated in construction and utility employment.\n\u201cThis is the product of a very deliberate policy to strengthen our workforce and to do it in partnership with organized labor,\u201d Zaidi said.\nDespite strong gains in the burgeoning clean energy sector, fragmentation in the energy patch pointed to the challenge Biden has faced in balancing the country\u2019s energy needs. Jobs in clean energy still account for less than half of all jobs in the sector.\nWhile the president has pledged to slash US emissions in half by 2030 from 2005 levels, he has also presided over a\u00a0record boom in US oil production.\nModerating demand for electric vehicles\u00a0has also complicated Biden\u2019s larger push to accelerate the adoption of green energy.\n\nJobs in clean energy vehicles grew by 11% in 2023, with the fastest growth in battery-electric vehicles. But major carmakers have pulled back on their EV ambitions in recent months, citing waning appetite in the market.\nLast week, Ford (F) announced it would\u00a0scrap the rollout\u00a0of its large electric SUV and delay the launch of its new electric pickup truck by one year. That came after GM (GM) announced it would push back production of electric pickups at its Orion Plant in Michigan until 2026 and delay the rollout of Buick\u2019s first EV indefinitely.\n\n\n",

        "text": "Coming Clean on Clean Energy: It\u2019s a Dirty Business\nUnless you\u2019ve been living under a rock, you are probably aware of the massive push to transition to green energy. The goal is to have wind and solar replace coal and natural gas; the electric vehicle (EV) will supposedly replace internal combustion engines. Directives are coming from the highest office in the land; the current administration has made green energy a large part of its agenda.\nWe are being told that these technologies are clean and will save the planet from climate change. However, these alternative forms of energy being espoused are riddled with their own problems.\nHidden behind the solar panels, wind turbines, and EV batteries are some dirty secrets that get swept under the rug and ignored by climate enthusiasts. Fossil fuels are constantly put under a microscope and condemned as an evil destructive polluter; green energy is typically put on a pedestal. Green energy, however, is not as perfect and wonderful as we are made to believe. Yet, we are putting a lot of trust into these energy sources, without considering their ramifications.\nThe American Consumer Institute just released a\u00a0report\u00a0detailing many of the environmental impacts associated with the so-called green energy forms being heavily promoted. The life cycle of all three\u2014the wind turbine, solar panel, and EV battery\u2014involve significant environmental consequences that should not be overlooked and need to be part of the discussion when implementing energy policies.\nOne of the biggest issues involved with these forms is the extraction and manufacturing processes of various critical minerals that are required for wind turbines, solar panels, and EV batteries. Many underdeveloped nations, where there\u2019s an abundance of minerals, are at risk. The operations and procedures not only overtake land but contaminate surrounding soil and water sources. In the worst cases, this work is accomplished through slave labor.\nVarious toxins and other greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere, where workers and even nearby communities are potentially affected. Landscape is tarnished and various animal habitats are shrinking and/or experiencing stress. The massive amount of land occupied by both wind and solar may never be recoverable.\nChina dominates the green energy supply chains, but their environmental standards are subpar.\u00a0CO2 emissions\u00a0associated with refineries in China are 1.5 times greater than those in the EU or U.S.\nAll three energy sources are also creating a huge waste problem. Since any kind of recycling is very limited on a large scale, more than 90% wind turbine blades, solar panels, and EV batteries end up in landfills. By 2050 it is predicted that used turbine blades will exceed\u00a043 million tons\u00a0of waste worldwide. Solar waste is predicted to be close to\u00a080 million tons. And with the U.S. projecting\u00a033 million EVs\u00a0on the road by 2030, that is a lot of batteries to end up in landfills.\nIronically, the same folks who want to charge customers for every plastic bag they use at the grocery store, out of fear of single-use plastics ending up in landfills, don\u2019t seem to have a problem with potentially toxic machinery filling that space instead.\nIn a penchant for trying to solve one crisis, we are creating others.\nSome of the environmental impacts and hazards posed by green energy are far more detrimental than fossil fuels, and yet the latter is often dismissed. Such risks associated with green technologies should actually be an argument against vigorous pursuit of them.\u00a0\nEach energy source, including fossil fuels, should be considered as part of an all-of-the-above strategy for supplying the necessary energy to power homes, businesses, and the U.S. economy at large. All of them come with some degree of environmental concerns, and each should be weighed and measured\u2014along with costs, logistics, reliability, and geopolitical factors\u2014when developing public policy. Instead of completely trying to phase out fossil fuels, a robust and healthy energy mix ought to be established; we need a balanced approach that does not breed additional problems.\nIt is past time to come clean on so-called clean energy. The real-life consequences and detrimental effects of it demand more honest conversations and a thoughtful course of action.\n",

        "text": "Embracing the Energy Transition, Reducing Methane Emissions\nIf president-elect\u00a0Claudia Sheinbaum\u00a0\u00a0sticks to the proposals and promises laid out in her campaign platform, \u201c100 Steps Toward Transformation,\u201d* \u00a0the next six years of her presidential term promise to be an improvement for Mexico\u2019s energy sector and the country's climate change abatement strategies.\u00a0\nSheinbaum never misses the opportunity to laud her mentor, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO) but her vocabulary when it comes to energy is much different than his, starting with the term \u201cenergy transition,\u201d a two-word combination that rarely, if ever, passed through his lips. While it is too early to celebrate a more rational energy and climate policy, there are reasons to be cautiously hopeful.\u00a0\nWhy is embracing the energy transition important for Mexico? First of all, because the country has fallen behind, a fact that negatively affects the country\u2019s competitiveness. AMLO had a hydrocarbon-centric policy that meant investing billions of dollars in an oil refinery, pulling back on private sector participation in the energy sector when funds are in dire need, complicating the scenario for renewables, and basically ignoring climate change. Mexico did make several commitments at COPs but didn\u2019t take meaningful steps to implement them.\u00a0\nIf Mexico wants to take advantage of investments coming from Asia to be closer to key markets (aka nearshoring), more must be done to improve energy competitiveness, which must include both energy efficiency and the development of renewables. Company boards making decisions about new factory locations must also ensure that they can meet emission reduction targets, thus making access to clean energy fundamental.\u00a0\nA key component of this strategy - and one that Sheinbaum did mention during her campaign - is the reduction of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Mexico is the 13th largest methane emitter globally and ranks third in Latin America. The country signed the Global Methane Pledge in the context of COP26. In November 20222, a methane emissions reduction cooperation agreement between the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Pemex was announced. What came of this? Not much, or at least nothing that has been publicly explained.\u00a0\nUnder AMLO, Pemex was tasked with extracting oil, full stop. Sustainability and methane emission reductions were not on the state-owned company\u2019s list of priorities. Now, both the reorganization and refocusing of Pemex are two key tasks that Sheinbaum\u2019s government will have to tackle. Doing so is not only critical to the incoming government\u2019s stated desire for energy sovereignty, but it is also a pragmatic necessity for Pemex to continue servicing its debt. Most financial institutions can no longer offer financing to a company with the dismal environmental record for which Pemex is famous.\u00a0\nWhy is methane such an important element of energy efficiency and sustainability in Mexico? \u00a0Because methane is essentially natural gas. Therefore, letting it escape into the atmosphere or burning the excess emitted during the oil extraction process is foolish, particularly for a country that needs to both increase its energy supply and start using lower carbon footprint energy; here I am talking about \u201ccleaner\u201d oil and gas, not renewable energy.\u00a0\nThe good news is that achieving greater energy efficiency and ensuring compliance with Mexico\u2019s international climate commitments are not insurmountable tasks, at least not from a technical point of view. So what stands in the way? Mostly bureaucracy and outdated thinking. Solving these challenges should not be political, but rather scientific and technical.\u00a0\nThe technology required to capture methane emissions is readily available and is cost-effective. The International Energy Agency (IEA) asserts that around 40% of today\u2019s methane emissions from fossil fuels could be avoided at no net cost.**\nIn the case of Mexico, if Pemex captures methane emissions, this natural gas can be reused for its own operations, or transported where energy is needed elsewhere. If Pemex is cash-strapped, how can it pay for new technology? There are both international financial institutions and private lenders that have expressed interest in ensuring that these strategies move forward.\nSheinbaum is someone who embraces science and practical solutions. Let us hope that her incoming energy team will seize upon methane emission reductions as a tangible opportunity to protect the environment, improve Mexico\u2019s energy security, and allow the country to attract investments that encourage shared well-being and prosperity. \u00a0It is worth remembering that nature acknowledges no borders; if we are going to tackle climate change, international cooperation is absolutely vital.\u00a0\n\n",

Some 90,000 barrels polluted ocean waters and yet, when I was scuba diving beneath it two decades later, the same production platform support structure once again hosted a magnificent ecosystem with millions of anemones, mussels, starfish, crabs and fish.\nThe 2010\u00a0Deepwater Horizon\u00a0drillship disaster killed eleven workers and blasted 3-4 million barrels of oil and enormous amounts of natural gas into the Gulf of Mexico. Yet within a surprisingly short time after the runaway well was capped, wave action, oil-dispersant chemicals, dust-covered oil droplets slowly sinking to the seafloor, and other natural forces had cleansed the waters of oil.\nThose other forces were\u00a0hydrocarbon-degrading microbes\u00a0that are always present in ocean waters worldwide \u2013 but rapidly reproduce when they sense oil in their environs. After depleting the hydrocarbon food sources, the microbes die off to normal numbers, and new organisms degrade the byproducts the initial foragers created, until those nutrients are also gone. Then their populations also plummet, in a newly clean ocean.\nThe disasters spurred industry to implement better blowout prevention technologies and procedures.\nIrrelevant, anti-oil activists say, they also emphasize why we must banish oil and gas \u2013 and replace fossil fuels with clean, green wind, solar and battery power. Otherwise, wildlife, beaches and tourism will be threatened repeatedly by oil spills.\nIt\u2019s becoming increasingly obvious that these supposed alternatives won\u2019t work \u2013 especially as AI, EVs, data centers, government-mandated electric heating and cooking, and charging grid-backup batteries, double or triple electricity generation demands. Intermittent electricity cannot power modern nations. Wind and solar cannot produce thousands of essential products that require petrochemical feed stocks. These energy sources are\u00a0not clean, green, renewable or sustainable. They\u00a0endanger wildlife.\nA recent mishap off the Nantucket, Massachusetts coast underscores yet another reason why hundreds or thousands of monstrous wind turbines cannot be permitted in America\u2019s coastal waters.\nShards, chunks and finally the rest\u00a0of a turbine blade fell into the ocean. One blade \u2026 from a 62-turbine project that\u2019s only three-fourths completed \u2026 broken by its own weight, not by a storm.\nAnd yet beaches had to be closed amid peak tourist season, while crews picked up pieces of fiberglass-resin-plastic-foam blades, and boats dodged big pieces floating in the water. Worse, Vineyard Wind didn\u2019t tell Nantucket officials about the problems until two days after the blade began disintegrating.\nEach blade is 350 feet long and 140,000 pounds. That\u2019s more than a fully occupied Boeing 737 jetliner. Vineyard Wind involves 186 blades: 65,000 feet (12 miles) in total combined length, weighing in at a combined 26,000,000 pounds!\nThe Biden-Harris offshore wind plan calls for 30,000 megawatts of generating capacity by 2030. That\u2019s 2,500 gigantic 12-MW offshore turbines. That won\u2019t even meet New York State\u2019s\u00a0current peak summer electricity needs, before all these extra demands kick in. Offshore wind\u2019s contribution toward meeting future demands for all Atlantic Coast states could easily require 5,000 such turbines: 15,000 blades, weighing a combined 2 billion pounds and spanning a combined 5,250,000 feet (995 miles)!\nEven more disturbing, the entire Atlantic coastline is hurricane country. Every year, almost without fail. The only questions are how many hurricanes, how powerful, and where each one will hit.\nNOAA records for landfalling hurricanes\u00a0\u2013 those that actually hit US beaches and cities \u2013 reveal that 105 Category 1-5 hurricanes struck the Atlantic seaboard, from Florida to Maine, from 1851 through 2023. Add in those that remained at sea, where the turbines will be, and that number could double.\nOf that total, 23 were\u00a0Category 3-5\u00a0(111-157 or higher mph winds). Most struck Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. But 39 made landfall between North Carolina and Delaware \u2013 and 19 hit Northeastern States, including nine Category 2-3 monsters (96-129 mph winds).\nMind you \u2013 these turbines will be weakened by constant corrosive salt spray and frequently by sub-hurricane storms. When the inevitable big hurricane roars up the coast, devastation will follow.\nKamala Harris is bullish about offshore wind. For the last 3-1/2 years she\u2019s helped run an administration that\u2019s determined to convert the USA to wind, solar and battery power, expedite permits for onshore and offshore \u201cclean energy\u201d projects, and even\u00a0waive requirements\u00a0that offshore wind developers post bonds and pay for removing damaged, broken and obsolete offshore wind towers.\nShe supports\u00a0banning plastic straws\u00a0but has never asked how many plastic straws it would take to equal 15,000 offshore wind turbine blades. (Using nautical terms, an unfathomable number.) Moreover, plastic straws don\u2019t contain dangerously sharp fiberglass shards, and can\u2019t sink fishing boats that collide with enormous but hard-to-see slabs of turbine blades.\nMs. Harris, Tim Walz and other wind zealots ignore worries about hurricanes wiping out forests of offshore wind turbines as anti-wind fearmongering. History says otherwise.\nThe 1935\u00a0Labor Day Hurricane\u00a0clobbered Florida with 200+ mph devastation, Georgia with Category 1 winds. The\u00a0Great New England Hurricane\u00a0of 1938 smashed into New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts with 115-120 mph force. 1944\u2019s\u00a0Great Atlantic Hurricane\u00a0\u2013 punished the coast from North Carolina to New Jersey and Massachusetts with Category 2 winds.\nEdna hit the Northeast with Category 2 winds in 1954, Donna did it again in 1960, and Gloria clobbered the region with 96-115 mph blasts in 1985, even reaching New Hampshire and Maine! Isabel hit North Carolina and Virginia in 2003. The \u201cminor\u201d Category 1 hurricane of 2012, better known as Superstorm Sandy, was also devastating.\nThis summary includes just some that hit North and Mid-Atlantic States, and a few that slammed Florida, Georgia and South Carolina \u2013 all prime territory for forests of offshore turbines, fixed to the seafloor or insanely sitting\u00a0atop enormous floating platforms\u00a0off Maine and other states. They\u2019d all flounder.\nReplacing hundreds or thousands of torn, damaged and smashed turbines and blades would take years, perhaps decades. Meanwhile, there would be no electricity in a\u00a0Harris-Biden-Walz-Democrat\u00a0government-mandated all-electric Eastern Seaboard. The absence of heating, air conditioning and power for homes, hospitals and everything else would displace millions and kill thousands.\nHopefully, politicians and bureaucrats could expedite new gas turbine and modular nuclear power plants. That would mean only a few years of deprivation and blackouts, instead of many years, perhaps decades.\nOtherwise, floating slabs of broken turbine blades would endanger boats for months or years, until they are retrieved, hauled ashore and landfilled. Cleaning up billions of sharp shards of fiberglass \u2013 each an inch to a couple feet in length, and nearly invisible \u2013 would likely take decades, during which time they would impale and imperil beach walkers, swimmers, fish, whales, dolphins and other marine life.\nI\u2019m not a microbiologist, but I\u2019m not aware of any microbes that devour fiberglass, resin or plastic foam.\nWith no bonds or requirements that Big Wind cover cleanup and turbine removal costs, electricity-bereft taxpayers and ratepayers would be left holding the bag.\nBefore we rush any further into this \u201crenewable energy transformation,\u201d can we first have some realistic, commonsense analysis? Can we at least\u00a0think\u00a0before casting our ballots this fall?\n",

Despite this, anti-oil activists argue that we must transition to \"clean\" energy sources like wind and solar power. However, these sources are not as clean or sustainable as claimed, and they pose their own environmental risks. A recent incident off the coast of Massachusetts, where a wind turbine blade broke apart and fell into the ocean, demonstrates the potential dangers of offshore wind farms. The blades are massive and can weigh over 140,000 pounds, posing a significant threat to marine life and human safety. The Biden-Harris administration's plan to install thousands of offshore wind turbines along the Atlantic coast could lead to devastating consequences, particularly in hurricane-prone areas. Hurricane-force winds could destroy entire wind farms, leaving behind a trail of destruction and debris. The cleanup process would be slow and costly, and taxpayers would likely be left to foot the bill. The author argues that we need to take a more realistic and commonsense approach to energy policy, rather than rushing into a \"renewable energy transformation\" without considering the potential consequences. We should think carefully before casting our ballots and supporting politicians who advocate for these policies."

        "text": "Myth of green energy transition\nDespite much hype, the much-vaunted green energy transition away from fossil fuels isn\u2019t happening. Achieving a meaningful shift with current policies turns out to be unaffordably costly. We need to drastically change policy direction.\nGlobally, we are already spending almost $2 trillion annually to force an energy transition. Over the past decade, solar and wind energy use has increased to their highest-ever levels. But it hasn\u2019t reduced fossil fuels\u2014over the same time, we have added even more fossil fuels.\nCountless studies show that when societies add more renewable energy, most of it never replaces coal, gas, or oil. It simply adds to energy consumption. Recent research shows that for every six units of new green energy, less than one unit displaces any fossil fuel. Analysis in the United States shows that renewable energy subsidies simply lead to more overall energy being used. In other words, policies meant to boost green energy are leading to more emissions.\nHumans have an unquenchable thirst for affordable energy, which is required for every aspect of modern life. In the past half-century, the energy we get from oil and coal has again doubled, hydropower has tripled, and gas has quadrupled\u2014and we have experienced an explosion in the use of nuclear, solar, and wind. The whole world\u2014and the average person\u2014has never had more energy available.\n\n\nThe grand plan underpinning today\u2019s green energy transition mostly insists that pushing heavily subsidized renewables everywhere will magically make fossil fuels go away. But a recent study concluded that talk of a transition is \u201cmisleading.\u201d During every previous addition of a new energy source, the researchers found, it has been \u201centirely unprecedented for these additions to cause a sustained decline in the use of established energy sources.\u201d\nWhat causes us to change our relative use of energy? One study investigated 14 shifts that have taken place over the past five centuries, like when farmers went from plowing fields with animals to fossil fuel-powered tractors. The main driver has always been that the new energy service is either better or cheaper.\nSolar and wind fail on both counts. They are not better, because, unlike fossil fuels that can produce electricity whenever we need it, they can only produce energy according to the vagaries of daylight and weather.\n\nThis means they are not cheaper, either. At best, they are only cheaper when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing at just the right speed. The rest of the time, they are mostly useless and infinitely costly.\n\nWhen we factor in the cost of just four hours of storage, wind and solar energy solutions become uncompetitive compared to fossil fuels. Achieving a real, sustainable transition to solar or wind would require orders of magnitude more storage, making these options incredibly unaffordable.\nMoreover, solar and wind only address a small part of a vast challenge. They are almost entirely deployed in the electricity sector, which makes up just one-fifth of all global energy use. We still struggle to find green solutions for most transport, and we haven\u2019t even begun with the vast energy needs of heating, manufacturing, or agriculture. We are all but ignoring the hardest and most crucial sectors like steel, cement, plastics, and fertilizer.\n\nLittle wonder then that, for all the talk of the world undergoing an energy transition, even the Biden administration finds that while renewable energy sources will dramatically increase globally up to 2050, oil, gas, and coal will all keep increasing, too.\nOn this trajectory, we will never achieve an energy transition away from fossil fuels. This would require vastly more subsidies for solar and wind, as well as for batteries and hydrogen, and for us all to accept less efficient technologies for important needs like steel and fertilizer. But on top of that, a true transition would also require politicians to impose massive taxes on fossil fuels to make them less desirable. McKinsey estimates the direct price tag to achieve a real transition at more than $5 trillion annually. This splurge would slow economic growth, making the real cost five times higher. Annual costs for people living in rich countries could be higher than $13,000 per person per year. Voters won\u2019t agree to that pain.\nThe only realistic way to achieve a transition is to vastly improve green energy alternatives. This means more investment in green energy research and development. Innovation is needed in wind and solar, but also in storage, nuclear energy, and many other possible solutions. Bringing alternative energy costs below the price of fossil fuels is the only way that green solutions can be implemented globally, and not just by the elite in a few climate-concerned, wealthy countries.\nWhen politicians tell you the green transition is here and we need to get on board, they are really just asking voters to support them, throwing more good money after bad. We need to be much smarter.\nTop of Form\nBottom of Form\n",

        "text": "New Financial Analysis Finds Significant Economic Benefits from Clean Energy Transition\n\nNEW YORK, Aug. 05, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \u00a0A new financial analysis by\u00a0Siebert Williams Shank (SWS)\u00a0finds that the projected infrastructure cost of the clean energy transition, while substantial, will be a worthwhile investment that could yield enormous economic benefits in the United States.\nThe 112-page study estimates that while the electric infrastructure costs of the transition are about\u00a0$10 trillion over the next 30-50 years, the net financial benefits to the U.S. economy could ultimately exceed $2.3 trillion annually.\n\u201cThe\u00a0clean\u00a0energy\u00a0transition translates into an opportunity for a step change in job creation and broader prosperity in the U.S. and globally,\u201d the SWS report states.\nAnalysts behind the report echoed that sentiment in a recent\u00a0\u201cIn Conversation with SWS\u201d podcast, in which they dive deeper into the findings\u2019 underlying mechanics.\nAccording to the report, the $10 trillion transition cost estimate for just U.S. electricity infrastructure equates to an average of about $331 billion annually for the prospective 30 years. That level of electricity infrastructure investment for the industry reflects only about 0.8% of 2023 annual GDP with a declining proportion to about a 0.4% share as the economy presumably grows about a modest 2.1% annually through 2053.\n\u201cCertainly an average of about 0.5% of annual GDP over a number decades is not too big of an ask for such an important economic transformation,\u201d the report says.\nSWS\u2019s clean energy transition report is relatively unique in two ways. First, while most such reports focus on the aggregate costs for all sectors in the transition, the SWS analysis breaks down the transition\u2019s implications for the electricity industries more specifically. The report examines two sectors: utilities and transportation, which collectively represent about 65% of U.S. carbon emissions.\nSecond, the report focuses on economics rather than climate change. Discussion in the media typically frames the clean energy transition as a debate about its effectiveness in combating global warming. Rarely is there deliberation over the full economic consequences of the proposed transition other than a potential reduction in carbon emissions for the environment.\n\u201cOur analysis tells us that the clean energy transition is a worthy economic endeavor. No climate or government ideology is required,\u201d the report says.\nIt continues, \u201cWhile the transition began as a solution to the climate change problem, we believe that it now stands on its own as an economic revolution that will lead to a great flourishing of the nation that all of America can support.\u201d\nSWS analysts assert that the clean energy transition\u00a0can largely be achieved without massive government incentive programs, carbon limits/taxes, or even a Green New Deal.\nThe economic transformation should be effectively self-funding in the aggregate due to the 200% electricity demand/usage growth expected over the next few decades with a few specific transition technology exceptions, in the analysts\u2019 opinion.\nAccording to the report, the increase in U.S. electricity demand is potentially a staggering amount over the next 30 years due to EV adoption, general industry electrification, AI, digital growth, and general economic growth trends.\nMost utilities today report that the significant growth is coming from large new data centers, new semiconductor manufacturing, and associated business activity. EV adoption will prove to be an even larger contributor to electricity usage/demand growth in the coming decades.\nThe report\u2019s estimates suggest a net annual savings in the trillions of dollars to the U.S. economy from just a transition in the electricity and transportation industries alone. Moreover, the transition could yield per capita net savings of $5,000-$7,000 annually, owing largely to avoided fossil fuel costs in daily driving, electricity production, and delivering household goods.\nFurther less tangible externality costs are avoided in substantially lower health care costs, reduced water pollution and its costs, reduced wear-and-tear on more complex equipment, and from corrosion, vehicle and home paint, etc.\nSWS analysts believe the phased clean energy transition will take multiple decades to fully achieve. In their view, focusing excessively on the 2050 date \u2014 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s target to reach zero net emissions \u2014 is counterproductive not just because it is unrealistic, but also because it leads skeptics to disregard carbon reduction efforts that are urgently needed.\nTo accelerate the transition, the U.S. needs more constructive discourse, better consumer education, and revised legal, legislative, and regulatory policies that will remove challenges to the transition, enable the transition, and develop further support from the general public.\n\u201cWe believe that government subsidies are not essential,\u201d the report says. \u201cMost of what we need is procedural and policy reform that is essentially free.\u201d\nDually headquartered in New York, NY and Oakland, CA, SWS is an independent non-bank financial services firm that offers investment banking, sales and trading, research, and advisory services.

        "text": "Renewable energy policies provide benefits across state lines, study shows\nW hile the U.S. federal government has clean energy targets, they are not binding. Most economically developed countries have mandatory policies designed to bolster renewable electricity production. Because the U.S. lacks an enforceable federal mandate for renewable electricity, individual states are left to develop their own regulations.\nMarilyn Brown, Regents' and Brook Byers Professor of Sustainable Systems in Georgia Tech's School of Public Policy; Shan Zhou, an assistant professor at Purdue University and Georgia Tech Ph.D. alumna; and Barry Solomon, a professor emeritus of environmental policy at Michigan Technological University, investigated how clean electricity policies affect not only the states that adopt them, but neighboring states as well. Using data-driven comparisons, the researchers found that the impact of these subnational clean energy policies is far greater\u2014and more nuanced\u2014than previously known.\nTheir research was recently\u00a0published\u00a0in the journal\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\"Analysts are asking if the U.S. should have a federal renewable mandate to put the whole country on the same page, or if individual state policies are sufficient,\" Brown said. \"To answer that question, it is useful to know if states with renewable energy policies are influencing those without them.\"\n\nBrown, Solomon, and Zhou examined a common clean energy policy tool: the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). Adopted by more than half of U.S. states, RPSs are regulations requiring a state's utility providers to generate a certain percentage of their electricity from renewable resources, such as wind or solar. Many of these standards are mandatory, with utility companies facing fines if they fail to reach targets within a given time.\nTo investigate the influence of these policies across state lines, the researchers first created a dataset that included 31 years (1991\u20132021) of annual renewable electricity generation data for 48 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. They then used the dataset to generate pairs of states linking each state to its geographic neighbors or electricity trading partners, allowing them to examine the influence of the RPS policy adopted by one of the pair on the renewable energy generation of the other\u2014a total of 1,519 paired comparisons.\n\"By only looking at the pairs, we can see if an RPS in one state directly affects renewable electricity generation in another state, and, if that's the case, whether it is because they are geographic neighbors or if it's because they are participating in the same wholesale electricity market,\" Zhou said.\nLooking into the electricity market is important, because states often purchase electricity from other states through wholesale markets rather than exclusively producing their own power, and the purchased power can be generated from renewables. Utilities in some states may be allowed to meet their own RPS requirements by purchasing renewable energy credits based on the renewable electricity generated in other states.\nIn their analyses, the team also considered the concept of \"policy stringency.\" A stringency measure evaluates a state's renewable electricity targets relative to the amount currently produced in the state. For example, if a state requires electric utilities to generate 30% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2030 and the state already has 25%, it isn't a very stringent policy. On the other hand, if a state has a 30% target and only uses 10% renewables currently, it has a more ambitious and stringent RPS.\nThough policy experts have used the metric in related work for over a decade, the research team improved the design.\n\"Our stringency variable includes interim targets as well as the existing share of renewable energy generation,\" Solomon said.\nThe team found that the amount of renewable electricity generation in a state is not only influenced by whether that state has its own RPS, but also by the RPS policies of neighboring states.\n\"We also learned that the stronger a neighboring state's RPS policy is, the more likely a given state is to generate more renewable electricity,\" Brown said. \"It's all a very interactive web with many co-benefits.\"\nThe authors were surprised to find that a given state's electricity trading partners did not hold the most influence over renewable generation, but rather the geographical proximity to RPS states. They suggest that past RPS policy research focusing on within-state impacts likely underestimated an RPS's full impact. While the researchers have not yet identified all factors that can cause spillover effects, they plan to investigate this further.\n\"The spillover effect is very significant and should not be overlooked by future research, especially for states without RPSs,\" Zhou said. \"For states without policies, their renewable electricity generation is very heavily influenced by their neighbors.\"\n",

IRENA estimates that, given the current high fossil fuel prices, the renewable power added in 2021 saves around USD 55 billion from global energy generation costs in 2022.\nIRENA\u2019s new report confirms the critical role that cost-competitive renewables play in addressing today\u2019s energy and climate emergencies by accelerating the transition in line with the 1.5\u00b0C warming limit and the Paris Agreement goals. Solar and wind energy, with their relatively short project lead times, represent vital planks in countries\u2019 efforts to swiftly reduce, and eventually phase out, fossil fuels and limit the macroeconomic damages they cause in pursuit of net zero.\n\u201cRenewables are by far the cheapest form of power today,\u201d\u00a0Francesco La Camera, Director-General of IRENA said. \u201c2022 is a stark example of just how economically viable new renewable power generation has become. Renewable power frees economies from volatile fossil fuel prices and imports, curbs energy costs and enhances market resilience \u2013 even more so if today\u2019s energy crunch continues.\u201d\n\u201cWhile a temporary crisis response might be necessary in the current situation, excuses to soften climate goals will not hold mid-to-long-term. Today\u2019s situation is a devastating reminder that renewables and energy saving are the future. With the COP27 in Egypt and COP28 in the UAE ahead, renewables provide governments with affordable energy to align with net zero and turn their climate promises into concrete action with real benefits for people on the ground,\u201d he added.\nInvestments in renewables continue to pay huge dividends in 2022, as highlighted by IRENA\u2019s costs data. In non-OECD countries, the 109 GW of renewable energy additions in 2021 that cost less than the cheapest new fossil fuel-fired option will reduce costs by at least USD 5.7 billion annually for the next 25-30 years.\nHigh coal and fossil gas prices in 2021 and 2022 will also profoundly deteriorate the competitiveness of fossil fuels and make solar and wind even more attractive. With an unprecedented surge in European fossil gas prices for example, new fossil gas generation in Europe will increasingly become uneconomic over its lifetime, increasing the risk of stranded assets.\nThe European example shows that fuel and CO2\u00a0costs for existing gas plants might average four to six times more in 2022 than the lifetime cost of new solar PV and onshore wind commissioned in 2021. Between January and May 2022, the generation of solar and wind power may have saved Europe fossil fuel imports in the magnitude of no less than USD 50 billion, predominantly fossil gas.\nAs to supply chains, IRENA\u2019s data suggests that not all materials cost increases have been passed through into equipment prices and project costs yet. If material costs remain elevated, the price pressures in 2022 will be more pronounced. Increases might however be dwarfed by the overall gains of cost-competitive renewables in comparison to higher fossil fuel prices.\n",

Cloudy, rainy days can reduce the efficiency of those products, but major storms can be really damaging, potentially tearing apart\u00a0solar panels\u00a0and their supporting pieces, especially for cheaply made or poorly installed systems in major hurricane-prone nations.\nA\u00a0study\u00a0by the University of California, Berkeley, in 2023 showed that the essential equipment is vulnerable to extreme storms and hurricanes with high winds especially, as\u00a0Inside Climate News\u00a0reported.\nThe paper focused on Caribbean nations and the aftermaths of Hurricanes Irma, Maria, and Dorian in 2017 and 2019. The panels did not hold up to their specifications, and residential ones were particularly susceptible.\u00a0\n\"Reported failures were often due to installation issues such as clamp failures, racking fractures and buckling, bolt shear failure and bolt loosening, according to the study,\" ICN stated.\u00a0\nThe outlet talked to lead author Luis Ceferino of UC Berkeley, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, to get a handle on the issue and similar problems in Florida.\u00a0\n\n\"It seems like the problem is there, but the scale of it, I don't think we know yet,\" Ceferino told ICN. \"People are working mostly on strengthening the panel itself so that it can sustain higher winds. I haven't seen as many people working on new designs for the structure that supports the panel.\" ICN noted recent solar projects in Barbuda and Puerto Rico \u2014 the latter of which was hammered by Hurricane Maria in 2017 and lost power for months \u2014 are supposed to withstand winds of at least 165 mph. But Category 5 winds can exceed that threshold, and even if they don't, the panels may be torn asunder anyway.\n\"Hurricanes can bring strong winds, and those winds can damage a lot of infrastructure,\" Ceferino told ICN. \"We're still understanding what impact these high winds bring on solar panels.\"\nDespite these issues, though, there are outliers. Florida's Babcock Ranch, which has hundreds of thousands of solar panels, may provide a blueprint. In 2022, the small town, built to be solely powered by solar energy, was\u00a0nearly unaffected\u00a0by Hurricane Ian and its\u00a0150 mph winds.\nAnother potential solution is a\u00a0\"super grid\"\u00a0with undersea cables connecting solar installations in the Caribbean to those in the United States and South America to not only mitigate the effects of hurricanes but also keep the lights on when the sun doesn't poke through the clouds. The project is in its infancy, though, and not close to the planning phase, as ICN reported.\n",

        "text": "Solar superpowers, wind warriors and hydro heroes: How communities are embracing renewable energy\nThe economic, societal and environmental benefits of renewable energy are numerous - It is available in abundance, cheaper and a healthier option for us and our planet.\u00a0\nAs technology and access to renewable energy sources - such as solar, wind, water, heat and biomass - improve, many more countries and communities are embracing their use not only to power their homes, schools, hospitals and workplace, but also as a viable option for employment and business opportunities.\u00a0\nLearn more about\u00a0types\u00a0and\u00a0benefits\u00a0of renewable sources of energy.\nLatest data\u00a0from the International Renewable Energy Agency and the International Labour Organization shows that employment in the renewable energy sector reached 12.7 million in 2021, a jump of 700,000 new jobs in just 12 months, despite the lingering effects of COVID-19 and the worsening energy crisis.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take a spin around the world and look at the growing demand for the power of renewables.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nJapan: Geothermal power revitalizes a town in Fukushima\nJapan has the world's third largest geothermal resources. However, geothermal power accounts for less than 1 per cent of total energy generated in Japan. \u201cTsuchiyu Onsen Town\u201d in Fukushima prefecture, which is famous for its hot springs with a 1400-year history, has recently attracted public attention for its geothermal power plant providing renewable energy to the community. Using steam to turn large turbines which run electrical generators, the plant is capable of generating enough electricity to power 800 households in a town of just 160 households.\nNot long ago, in 2011, the region experienced unprecedented hardships in the form of the Great East Japan Earthquake and the accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Using the rich hot springs in the area, renewable energy became central to the town's reconstruction. The geothermal power plant that went into operation in 2015 has provided reliable energy and generated abundant revenue from electricity sales that is being re-invested in the town's welfare and tourism promotion. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nBangladesh: Roadmap to climate resilience\nBy transitioning from natural gas to green hydrogen and biomass power plants, the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan is Bangladesh\u2019s roadmap for climate resilience, energy independence, and access to renewable energy by 2030.\u00a0\nOver the next few years, the country plans to achieve 30 per cent renewable energy consumption and 30 per cent electrified transportation, extending energy access to 100 per cent of the population, providing more than 4 million climate-resilient jobs, and ensuring widespread clean cooking solutions.\u00a0\nCambodia: Changing the lives of rural communities\nIn 2000, less than 7 per cent of Cambodia\u2019s rural areas - home to 75 per cent of the population - had access to electricity. Today, that number has soared to nearly 100 per cent as communities in some 13,700 villages, many of them remote, now have electricity.\u00a0\nHow? With solar-based decentralized mini-grids. The UN Development Programme calls Cambodia \u201ca fast-mover in embracing renewables.\u201d Through transitioning to renewables, countries like Cambodia are looking at long-term economic benefits, laying the foundation for a low-carbon economy and energy security without jeopardizing the health of our planet.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nChile: Geothermal energy in the desert\nChile was the first country in South America to champion the use of geothermal energy, having spent recent years establishing a legal framework and developing manufacturing capacity to accommodate the production of renewable energy. Since 2017, the World Bank has been supporting the government\u2019s efforts to remove specific legal, social and market barriers and improve geothermal market conditions.\u00a0\nChile\u2019s Cerro Pabell\u00f3n plant, located in the Atacama Desert at 4,500 meters above sea level, is now the only commercial-scale geothermal plant in the region. It helps to heat and cool homes, hotels and schools as well as power greenhouses, fish farms and even vineyards.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDenmark: World\u2019s first artificial wind island\nIn 1991, Denmark was the first country to build an offshore wind farm. In recent years, the Scandinavian country has been working towards building the world\u2019s first-ever artificial wind energy island - the largest construction project in Danish history.\u00a0\nThe size of the island will eventually be equivalent to 64 football fields, providing wind-powered energy to some ten million families across Europe as well as powering planes, ships and heavy industries.\u00a0\nIn 2021, Denmark also teamed up with Costa Rica to launch a new initiative called\u00a0Beyond Oil and Gas, calling on more countries to join the coalition and support global efforts to transition to renewable energy.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nEgypt: Tapping into a nation\u2019s energy potential\nIn 2016, Egypt adopted a plan to facilitate the transition to clean energy, targeting more than 40 per cent renewables in its total electricity generation by 2035. To do so, the government established the Grid-Connected Small-Scale Photovoltaic Project, investing in the country\u2019s energy potential, and tapping into the needs of the industrial, educational, tourism, commercial, residential, and public sectors.\u00a0\nToday, an estimated 125 individual solar power systems have been installed, with the ability to produce 17,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, benefiting around nearly 9,000 families and businesses.\n\u00a0\nEl Salvador: Improving energy security\nEl Salvador entirely depends on imported fossil fuels and electricity to meet its domestic demand for energy but in the last decade has prioritised the development of renewables to mitigate import dependency and improve its energy security.\u00a0\nToday, to expand its electricity access and diversify its energy mix, it is scaling up the production of solar, wind, bioenergy, hydropower and geothermal energy.\u00a0\nLatest data shows that more than 2 million jobs have been created by the renewable energy sector in Latin America and the Caribbean by 2017, and that number is expected to reach 3 million jobs by 2030.\n\u00a0\nIndia: Wind, Solar, and Hydropower\nWith a rapidly growing population of 1.38 billion, there is a great demand for energy in India. In 2020, the UN Environment Programme teamed up with the country\u2019s largest renewable energy company, ReNew Power, to accelerate the development and use of a diverse mix of renewable energy across the country, advancing India\u2019s ambitious climate plans to realize its Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement.\u00a0\nMalawi: Keeping children healthy with solar technology\nWith the installation of solar grids, Malawi and its partners such as UNICEF are prioritizing the availability of renewable and affordable energy for communities in hard-to-reach, rural communities that are unable to access the centralized national electricity grid.\u00a0\u00a0\nToday, energy solutions like mini-grids and standalone solar grids supply electricity for essential services, including water purification, healthcare, and education facilities, that are especially critical for the development and wellbeing of children.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nNew Zealand: Towards full renewable electricity generation\nIn 2019, nearly 50 per cent of the total supply of electricity in New Zealand came from renewable sources, particularly energy generated from biomass, geothermal, hydropower and the ocean.\u00a0\nThe country continues to phase out its offshore oil and gas productions, and is currently considering options for 100 per cent renewable electricity generation, backed by its large hydro storage capacity.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSmall Island Developing States: Powering a safer future\nThe SIDS Lighthouse initiative, which was launched during the UN Climate Change Conference in 2014, works with governments, regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, to help some 40 islands across the Caribbean, the Pacific and the Atlantic transition to renewable energy and support much-needed climate action.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nSince the launch of the initiative, the use of renewables has grown consistently, with a remarkable acceleration in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Installed renewable energy capacity in the island states grew from 3.5 GW in 2014 to 5.9 GW in 2020, hitting record growth of 19.5 per cent between 2018 and 2019.\n\u00a0\nYemen: Powering critical healthcare facilities\nSuffering from a prolonged and protracted humanitarian crisis and considered a least developed country, many Yemeni communities lack access to basic services, including healthcare and energy.\u00a0\nIn 2022, a UN-led initiative called Renewable Energy Improve Access to Health Services and Livelihood Opportunities or HEAL is helping to finance and support 50 Yemeni-owned solar energy microgrid businesses that can provide electricity to critical healthcare facilities in several governorates, creating job opportunities, tackling energy poverty and providing much-needed health services.\n",

        "title": "The Appalling Delusion of 100 Percent Renewables, Exposed",
        "text": "The Appalling Delusion of 100 Percent Renewables, Exposed\n\nThe National Academy of Science refutes Mark Jacobson\u2019s dream that our economy can run exclusively on \u2018green\u2019 energy..\nThe idea that the U.S. economy can be run solely with renewable energy \u2014 a claim that leftist politicians, environmentalists, and climate activists have endlessly promoted \u2014 has always been a fool\u2019s errand. And on Monday, the National Academy of Sciences published a blockbuster paper by an all-star group of American scientists that says exactly that.\nThe\u00a0paper, by Chris Clack, formerly with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Colorado Boulder, and 20 other top scientists, appeared in the\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. It decimates the work of Mark Jacobson, the Stanford engineering professor whose wildly exaggerated claims about the economic and technical viability of a 100 percent renewable-energy system has made him a celebrity (he appeared on David Letterman\u2019s show in 2013) and the hero of Sierra Clubbers, Bernie Sanders, and Hollywood movie stars, including Leonardo DiCaprio.\nJacobson became the darling of the green Left even though his work was based on Enron accounting, alternative facts, and technology hopium. Nevertheless, his claims were politically popular, and his academic papers routinely sailed through peer review. In 2015, Jacobson published a paper, co-written with Mark Delucchi, a research engineer at the University of California, Berkeley, in the\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The paper, which claimed to offer \u201ca low-cost solution to the grid reliability problem\u201d with 100 percent renewables, went on to win the Cozzarelli Prize, an annual award handed out by the National Academy. A Stanford website said that Jacobson\u2019s paper was one of six chosen by \u201cthe editorial board of the\u00a0Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\u00a0from the more than 3,000 research articles published in the journal in 2015.\u201d The fact that the National Academy would bestow such a prestigious award on such weak scholarship greatly embarrass the Academy, which\u00a0gets 85 percent of its funding from the federal government.\nIn their scathing takedown of Jacobson, Clack and his co-authors \u2014 who include Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution, Dan Kammen of the University of California, Berkeley, former EPA Science Advisory Board chairman Granger Morgan, and Jane Long of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory \u2014 concluded that Jacobson\u2019s 2015 paper contained \u201cnumerous shortcomings and errors.\u201d The paper used \u201cinvalid modeling tools, contained modeling errors, and made implausible and inadequately supported assumptions.\u201d Those errors \u201crender it unreliable as a guide about the likely cost, technical reliability, or feasibility of a 100 percent wind, solar, and hydroelectric power system.\u201d\nAmong the biggest errors \u2014 and one that should force the Academy to withdraw Jacobson\u2019s 2015 paper \u2014 is that Jacobson and Delucchi overstated\u00a0by roughly a factor of ten\u00a0the ability of the United States to increase its hydropower output. Furthermore, the paper ignores two key issues: electricity storage and land use. Jacobson claimed that the U.S. can store energy underground or store it in the form of hydrogen. Clack and his co-authors wrote that \u201cthere are no electric storage systems available today that can affordably and dependably store the vast amounts of energy needed over weeks to reliably satisfy demand using expanded wind and solar power generation alone.\u201d\nBut the most obvious flaw in Jacobson\u2019s scheme involves his years-long refusal to admit the massive amount of land his proposal would require; his myriad acolytes have repeated his nonsensical claims. For instance, last year, Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org and one of America\u2019s highest-profile climate activists, wrote an August 2016 cover story for\u00a0The\u00a0New Republic\u00a0in which he lauded Jacobson\u2019s work and repeated Jacobson\u2019s erroneous claim that his all-renewable program would need only \u201cabout four-tenths of one percent of America\u2019s landmass.\u201d\nClack et al. correct the record by pointing out that Jacobson\u2019s scheme would require \u201cnearly 500,000 square kilometers, which is roughly 6 percent of the continental United States, and more than 1,500 square meters of land for wind turbines for each American.\u201d In other words, Clack found that Jacobson understated the amount of land needed for his all-renewable dystopia\u00a0by a factor of 15. But even that understates the amount of territory needed. Jacobson\u2019s plan requires nearly 2.5 terawatts (2.5 trillion watts) of wind-energy capacity, with the majority of that amount onshore. The Department of Energy has repeatedly stated that the footprint of wind energy, known as its capacity density, is 3 watts per square meter. And so 2.5 trillion watts divided by 3 watts per square meter equals 833 billion square meters (or 833,000 square kilometers): That\u2019s a territory nearly twice the size of California.\nThe idea of using two California-size pieces of territory \u2014 and covering them with hundreds of thousands of wind turbines \u2014 is absurd on its face.\nThe idea of using two California-size pieces of territory \u2014 and covering them with hundreds of thousands of wind turbines \u2014 is absurd on its face. And yet, Jacobson\u2019s 100 percent renewable scenario has become energy gospel among left-leaning politicians. For instance, in January, New York governor Andrew\u00a0Cuomo touted his renewable-energy goals\u00a0and declared that his state was not going to stop \u201cuntil we reach 100 percent renewable because that\u2019s what a sustainable New York is really all about.\u201d\nIn February, 54 Massachusetts lawmakers \u2014 representing more than a quarter of the members of the state legislature \u2014 signed on to a bill that would require the Bay State to get 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2050. The bill (S. 1849) says that the goal is to \u201cultimately eliminate our use of fossil fuels and other polluting and dangerous forms of energy.\u201d\nIn April, U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D., Ore.), Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), Edward J. Markey (D., Mass.), and Cory Booker (D., N.J.) introduced the 100 by \u201950 Act, which calls on the United States to be completely free of fossil fuels by 2050. The bill, available\u00a0here, is a laundry list of terrible ideas, including a \u201ccarbon duty\u201d on any foreign-made goods that are made by energy-intensive industries. And as is standard with all-renewable promoters, the bill doesn\u2019t contain a single mention of the word \u201cnuclear\u201d even though some of the world\u2019s highest-profile climate scientists, including James Hansen, have said nuclear must be included in any effort to reduce our greenhouse-gas emissions. The 100 by \u201950 legislation was \u2014 of course \u2014 endorsed by a who\u2019s who of all-renewable cultists, including actor Mark Ruffalo; Michael Brune, the executive director of the Sierra Club; and May Boeve, the executive director of 350.org.\nJacobson\u2019s response to the Clack paper (and to the ensuing Twitter storm attacking his work) would have made Captain Queeg proud. He has claimed, among other things, that his paper contains no errors; that Clack and the other authors are simply shilling for the nuclear and hydrocarbon sectors; and that the Department of Energy\u2019s capacity data on wind energy (3 watts per square meter) is wrong and that, instead, the figure should be 9 watts per square meter.\nThe late David J. C. MacKay, a physics professor at the University of Cambridge, would have been horrified. In 2008, MacKay published\u00a0Sustainable Energy \u2014 wthout the Hot Air, one of the first academic books to look at the\u00a0land-use impacts of renewables. MacKay, who recognized that nuclear must be part of any effort to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, also calculated that\u00a0wind energy needs about 700 times more land\u00a0to produce the same amount of energy as a fracking site. Three years ago, shortly before his death at age 46 from cancer, MacKay talked with British author and writer Mark Lynas about his work. During that interview, MacKay called the idea of relying solely on renewables an \u201cappalling delusion.\u201d\nThe punch line here is clear: The Clack paper proves that it\u2019s well past time for the green Left and their political allies to quit claiming that we don\u2019t need hydrocarbons or nuclear energy. Alas, it appears they prefer appalling delusions about renewables to real science and simple math.\n",

        "summary": "The National Academy of Sciences has published a paper refuting the idea that the US economy can run solely on renewable energy. The paper, written by Chris Clack and 20 other top scientists, debunks the work of Mark Jacobson, who claimed that a 100% renewable-energy system is viable. Jacobson's work has been widely promoted by leftist politicians, environmentalists, and climate activists, despite being based on \"Enron accounting, alternative facts, and technology hopium.\" Jacobson's 2015 paper, which won a prestigious award, contains numerous errors and shortcomings, including overstating the ability to increase hydropower output by a factor of ten. The paper also ignores key issues such as electricity storage and land use, with Clack et al. pointing out that Jacobson's scheme would require nearly 500,000 square kilometers of land, roughly 6% of the continental US. This is a massive understatement, with the actual land required being nearly twice the size of California. Despite the flaws, Jacobson's work has been widely cited and promoted by politicians and activists, including Bernie Sanders and Leonardo DiCaprio. The Clack paper proves that it's time to quit claiming that renewables can meet all our energy needs, but the green Left and their allies prefer to cling to \"appalling delusions\" about renewables rather than accepting real science and math. Jacobson has responded to the criticism by claiming that his paper contains no errors and that Clack and others are shilling for the nuclear and hydrocarbon sectors. The idea of relying solely on renewables is, in fact, an \"appalling delusion\" that must be abandoned."

        "text": "The renewable green energy disaster off the northeastern US is getting worse\n\nA slow-motion collapse in the offshore wind industry continues to grow as sticky inflation and supply chain challenges force developers to delay or cancel major projects. In particular, progress towards the Biden administration\u2019s goal of building large amounts of floating wind off the northeastern US coast is just about stalled.\nShell, which\u00a0 invested in a series of offshore wind projects in recent years, including offshore the northeastern United States, announced last week it would lay off much of its offshore wind business staff as the oil giant advances its program of refocusing on its core oil and gas business.\n\u201cWe are concentrating on select markets and segments to deliver the most value for our investors and customers,\u201d a Shell spokesperson told\u00a0Bloomberg. \u201cShell is looking at how it can continue to compete for offshore wind projects in priority markets while maintaining our focus on performance, discipline and simplification.\u201d\nWind turbine maker\u00a0Siemens Gamesa announced\u00a0even bigger layoffs, saying it would cut 15 per cent of its global staff to adjust to a slowing market. The announcement comes after the company reported a \u20ac4.6 billion loss for 2023, a losing trend that has continued over the first half of 2024.\n\u201cOur current situation demands adjustments that go beyond organizational changes. We have to adapt to lower business volumes, reduced activity in non-core markets, and a streamlined portfolio,\u201d\u00a0said outgoing CEO Jochen Eickholt in a letter to staff.\u00a0\nOn May 29 came\u00a0survey results\u00a0compiled by London-based energy consultancy Westwood indicating the global floating offshore wind industry is likely to deliver less than 3 gigawatts (GW) of new floating generation capacity by 2030, and a total of roughly 10 GW by 2040. Westwood cites lack of standardization of floating technology (55 per cent), manufacturing capability and capacity (51 per cent) and port infrastructure (50 per cent) as the primary impediments.\u00a0\nIn light of the industry\u2019s gloomy outlook, Westwood notes that \u201ccalls are ringing out for governments to provide more specific policy and regulatory support for technology development in addition to cost reduction and investment in port infrastructure to accelerate adoption.\u201d\nThis is completely predictable, since the voracious rent-seeking wind business invariably calls for more government largesse in response to any challenge that arises. Unfortunately, the call is too often answered by policymakers who have made big political bets on being able to show off arrays of mammoth windmills floating atop various oceans and seas, intermittently producing some electricity \u2013 generally 25-30 per cent of nominal plant capacity over time.\nThis latest bad news for offshore wind could become especially troublesome for US President Joe Biden\u2019s re-election campaign, since he has invested so much of his personal political capital in pushing a major buildout of floating offshore wind in the Atlantic northeast. A 2023 Department of Energy\u00a0fact sheet\u00a0sets the administration\u2019s goal of installing 30 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 for the US alone, exceeding Westwood\u2019s just estimated potential for\u00a0global\u00a0new capacity by that year by a factor of 10 times over.\u00a0\nTo date, regulators under Biden have approved permits for 6 major offshore projects, several of which have already been delayed or cancelled by developers in response to tougher economic factors. In late 2023, major Danish wind developer Orsted\u00a0cancelled\u00a0two projects off the Atlantic coast, and Shell divested its 50 per cent stake in another in March of this year. Equinor and BP announced in January they were cancelling plans for their Empire Wind 2 project, citing similar economic concerns.\u00a0\nOne US offshore project, Vineyard Wind 1,\u00a0was able\u00a0to begin delivering its intermittent 25-30 per cent of 68 megawatts (MW) to Massachusetts residents in January with the activation of 5 offshore turbines. The South Fork Wind Project was also able to\u00a0commence first deliveries\u00a0into New York in March, with 12 turbines capable of generating some proportion of 130 MW.\u00a0\nBut this is less than one per cent of the Biden goal of 30 GW, with just five and a half years remaining until 2030. Given the wind industry\u2019s insatiable appetite for ever-increasing subsidies and constantly rising utility charges, it\u2019s an open question how many more billions of dollars the federal government will be allowed to print to keep projects alive before the voters start to rebel at the cost.\n\tIt\u2019s a rebellion that could commence as soon as this coming November.",

The industry cites lack of standardization, manufacturing capability, and port infrastructure as major impediments. The US government's goal of installing 30 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030 is unlikely to be met, with only 6 major projects approved so far. Several of these projects have already been delayed or cancelled due to economic concerns. Only two US offshore projects have begun delivering electricity, producing a fraction of the 30 GW goal.

        "text": "AI 'early warning' system shows promise in preventing hospital deaths, study says\nAn AI early-warning system that predicts which patients are at risk of deteriorating while in hospital was associated with a decrease in unexpected deaths, a new study says.\nThe study, published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, found a 26 per cent reduction in non-palliative deaths among patients in St. Michael's Hospital's general internal medicine unit when the AI tool was used.\n\"We've seen that there is a lot of hype and excitement around artificial intelligence in medicine. We've also seen not as much actual deployment of these tools in real clinical environments,\" said lead author Dr. Amol Verma, a general internal medicine specialist and scientist at the hospital in Toronto.\n\"This is an early example of a tool that's deployed that was rigorously tested and evaluated and where it's showing promise for actually helping improve patient care,\" Verma, who is also a professor of AI research and education in medicine at the University of Toronto, said in an interview.\nThe technology called CHARTwatch continuously analyzed more than 100 different pieces of information about each patient in the unit, Verma said.\nWhen the AI tool predicted that a patient was deteriorating, it sent an alert to physicians and nurses, prompting them to quickly intervene.\n\"The machine learning tool gathers the information that's already routinely collected in a patient's electronic medical record,\" he said.\nThat includes information such as age and medical history, as well as measurements such as vital signs, blood pressure, heart rate and lab test results.\n\"It gathers all of that information to make a prediction about their risk of becoming more seriously ill going forward and then it updates its model predictions every hour based on how all of those things are changing over time,\" Verma said.\nIf the clinician agreed with the AI prediction after examining the patient, necessary action was taken. That included transferring the patient to the intensive care unit, giving them antibiotics for serious infections such as sepsis, or monitoring the patient more frequently.\nIf a patient's death was inevitable they would receive end-of-life care earlier than they might have otherwise, easing their suffering, Verma said.\n\"Importantly, the AI doesn't tell the clinician 'prescribe this drug, you know, intervene with this test or this treatment.' That's all still up to the judgment of the nurses and the doctors doing the care,\" he said.\n\"It's a signal that says, 'hey, pay attention to this patient.'\u201d\nThose early-warning signals are important in busy hospital settings where each nurse or doctor is caring for many patients who are getting multiple lab tests, medical imaging and other interventions that could change their prognosis, Verma said.\n\"It's just not possible for humans to keep their eyes on 20, 30 patients at the same time, all the time,\" he said.\nMuhammad Mamdani, co-senior author of the study, said AI can process large amounts of data about patients \u2014 and combining that with a human clinician's judgment can lead to better care.\nPhysicians and nurses should always err on the side of caution when using the tool, said Mamdani, who is the vice president of data science and advanced analytics at Unity Health Toronto, which includes St. Michael's Hospital.\n\"What we tell our clinicians is, \u2018if you think this patient's going to die, but the algorithm says, the AI says, 'no, they're fine,' don't believe the AI. Believe your gut,\" he said.\n\"But if the AI says 'this patient's going to die' and you don't think so, don't believe your gut. Believe the AI.\u2019\u201d\nThe study looked at non-palliative patient deaths in the general internal medicine unit between Nov. 1, 2020 and June 1, 2022 when the AI tool was used and compared them to a previous time period \u2014 Nov. 1, 2016 to June 1, 2020 \u2014 when the technology wasn't used.\nThe researchers found a 2.1 per cent non-palliative death rate when AI wasn't used, compared to 1.6 per cent when it was.\nTo reduce the possibility that the results could be attributed to the different time periods, the researchers used the hospital's cardiology, respirology and nephrology units \u2014 which didn't have the AI tool \u2014 as a comparison. None of those units showed a difference in non-palliative deaths between the two time periods.\nThe researchers controlled for potential confounding factors such as age. In addition, because the study period coincided with the COVID-19 pandemic, which could be another variable affecting the results, the researchers excluded data about COVID patients.\nIn total, the study included 13,649 patient admissions in the general internal medicine unit and 8,470 patient admissions in the cardiology, respiratory and nephrology comparison units.\nVerma said although the results are promising, they should be interpreted with caution and a randomized control trial is needed to hold the AI research up to the same standard as drug and medication studies.\nRoss Mitchell, a professor in the faculty of medicine at the University of Alberta who was not involved in the study, said the research was \"very encouraging.\"\n\"This specific technology, CHARTwatch, needs to be studied in a broader sense,\" said Mitchell, who is the Alberta Health Services chair in AI in health.\n\"It needs to be deployed in more hospitals across Canada so that we can get more than one hospital involved.\u201d\n",

Health care providers are spending heavily on IT and adopting new computer-generated tools, and a recent Cleveland Clinic\u00a0national survey\u00a0found that 3 in 5 Americans believe that AI will lead to better heart care.\nIndividuals are still cautious about how they use AI when it comes to their health. The Cleveland Clinic survey showed that 72% of individuals believe the health advice they receive from a computer chatbot is accurate, but 89% said they would still seek doctor\u2019s advice before acting on chatbot recommendations. The online survey was conducted among 1000 people aged 18 years or older. Respondents were nationally representative regarding age, gender, region, education, household income, race/ethnicity, and urban/rural residency.\nMost Americans using health monitoring technology are experiencing significant physical and mental benefits. According to survey responses, 79% have noticed positive changes to their physical or mental health. The survey found that 60% of Americans track their daily step count and 53% monitor their heart rate/pulse. It also showed that 40% track their burned calories, 32% track their blood pressure, and 53% say they began exercising more regularly after using wearable technology to monitor their health.\nThe survey showed that due to monitoring technology, 50% are getting in more steps per day and 34% are improving their eating habits. Further, 27% are more intentional about finding time to de-stress and relax.\nHealth care providers are spending heavily on IT, suggesting that technology is becoming a leading strategic priority for health care practices. In a survey of 201 health care provider executives in the United States conducted in June 2023 by\u00a0Bain & Company and KLAS Research, 56% of respondents cited software and technology as among their top 3 strategic priorities compared with 34% in 2022.\nThe survey showed that 75% of respondents expect growth in software and technology spending to continue over the next 12 months. Revenue cycle management and clinical workflow optimization remain top areas of investment, according to the survey. However, patient engagement has moved up the list of priorities, particularly among more advanced or digitally mature providers.\nE. Scot Davis, of Little Rock, Arkansas, a member of the\u00a0LUGPA (Large Urology Group Practice Association) Board of Directors\u00a0with nearly 30 years of experience in physician practice management, said the demand for urologic services is increasing while the supply of urologists available to treat patients is suboptimal. \u201cPractices must find innovative ways to meet the needs of our patients,\u201d he said. \u201cPhysicians and advanced practice providers can only see so many patient encounters in a day, and burnout among urologists is one of the highest of all specialties.\u201d\nThe use of AI combined with emerging telephone technologies may offer solutions to ease this challenge. \u201cPerhaps the number 1 complaint heard among my colleagues is the vast number of phone calls that need to be answered on a daily basis,\u201d Davis said. \u201cPractices might consider utilizing interactive voice recognition (IVR) software in conjunction with live operators to be able to meet the patients\u2019 needs as well as reduce costs.\u201d\u00a0\nUrology practices must evaluate each touchpoint, from initial patient contact to clinic visit and culminating with billing and follow-up, and consider how AI and technology can help improve the patient experience and reduce costs, according to Davis. Many electronic medical record systems have \u201cbolt-on\u201d products to improve pre-authorization processes. The systems also have automatic coding software, integrated patient responses directly into the patient chart, and methods to improve the collections process.\n\u201cUrology practices must embrace and implement AI and technology,\u201d Davis said. \u201cObviously, any technology that improves the overall patient experience is good for the patient and the practice. Additionally, there will be a positive financial impact to the practices adopting AI and technology, if implemented correctly and timely.\u201d\u00a0\nEmerging trends show technology is improving patient engagement through the use of IVR, triage software utilizing conversational chatbots, and self-scheduling tools for patient ease. From an administrative side, Davis said he foresees practices adopting more pre-authorization software technology combined with billing and coding applications to drop claims quicker with greater accuracy.\u00a0\n\u201cThis feature will feed well into an interactive dictation tool for providers to document more easily and efficiently, he said. \u201cAll of this technology and AI adoption will require an acceptance and change by the providers who must first believe the software will work, and secondly, will trust it can do it as well as they can do it. Without those, much time and effort and money will be spent without any useful benefits.\u201d\n",

A CNA spokesperson reported that more than 200 nurses attended the rally.\n\"We want [hospitals] to take a huge pause and reflect and be accountable to make sure they test it, they validate it, before using it on our patients,\" Gutierrez-Vo said.\nShe added that she hopes regulators and the public will join with the CNA in demanding that developers and employers prove these new systems are safe, effective, and equitable.\nIn fact,\u00a0lawmakers and regulators\u00a0have begun to focus on\u00a0the development and implementation\u00a0of AI in healthcare, and research has shown that AI can be\u00a0an effective clinical support tool\u00a0in certain situations.\nExperts have cautioned, however, that\u00a0generative AI tools still require human oversight\u00a0due to the risks of using the technology in healthcare settings, such as its tendency to\u00a0introduce biased or incorrect information\u00a0into clinical decision-making.\n\nDouglas B. Johnson, MD, MSCI, a medical AI researcher from Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, told\u00a0MedPage Today\u00a0that the standard approach to implementing this technology has been to test it with a small team within an institution first.\n\"You can certainly implement it too soon or implement it too broadly,\" he said. \"There are many ways that it could potentially go wrong.\"\nAI technology offers several intriguing benefits, such as decreasing burnout, he added, but implementing the technology should balance those benefits with patient safety, as well as buy-in from nurses, physicians, and administrators.\n\"It's very important to get everyone in the room because all stakeholders bring a potentially valuable perspective, especially if they're the ones who are actually implementing it,\" Johnson said. \"It's also helpful for people who are going to use the tool to be educated on it thoroughly as well.\"\nGutierrez-Vo said one of the CNA's biggest concerns are systems within electronic health records that \"ration care by under-predicting how sick a patient might become.\"\nKaiser Permanente, like many health systems, uses Epic, a popular electronic health record vendor, which has a patient acuity system that assigns patients a number to reflect how ill they are. But it doesn't factor in a patient's changing mental status and language barriers, or account for a patient whose mobility may have declined, Gutierrez-Vo explained.\n\"There's a lot of different nuances in the human condition that only eyes and ears, and a trained, specialized nurse can tell ... how much of their time was needed in order to make sure this patient was safe, and how much more is going to be needed for the next shift,\" she said.\nIn 2019, Kaiser Permanente Northern California launched the Desktop Medicine Program, which according to a\u00a0JAMA Network Open\u00a0research letter, uses natural language processing algorithms to tag messages with category labels and route them to the appropriate respondents. The system was found to have funneled 31.9% of over 4.7 million patient messages to a \"regional team\" of medical assistants, tele-service representatives, pharmacists, and other physicians who \"resolved\" those messages before they reached individual physician inboxes.\nBut Gutierrez-Vo said that she finds the messaging system problematic.\nIf a patient who recently had a heart attack messages his physician requesting to refill a nitroglycerin prescription, that message should be flagged as urgent. In this new system, it will be categorized as a medication request, deemed \"non-urgent,\" and directed to a pharmacist, despite signaling a \"life-or-death situation,\" she explained.\nWhile nursing unions have negotiated \"enforceable language\" in their contracts requiring that they be notified of new technologies and modifications, employers aren't always complying with those contracts, Gutierrez-Vo said. If nurses call for a \"hard stop,\" because, for example, the staffing that results from these technologies appears to be inappropriate, management is accountable for making those changes immediately.\nKaiser Permanente did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n",

        "text": "Chatbots Struggle to Answer Medical Questions in Widely Spoken Languages\nTwo popular chatbots showed some difficulty in providing medical information when asked in Spanish, Hindi or Mandarin\nPlugging medical symptoms into Google is so common that clinicians have nicknamed the search engine \u201cDoctor Google.\u201d But a newcomer is quickly taking its place: \u201cDoctor Chatbot.\u201d People with medical questions are drawn to generative artificial intelligence because chatbots can answer conversationally worded questions with simplified summaries of complex technical information. Users who direct medical questions to, say, OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT or Google\u2019s Gemini may also trust the AI tool\u2019s chatty responses\u00a0more than a list of search results.\nBut that trust might not always be wise. Concerns remain as to whether these models can consistently provide safe and accurate answers. New study findings, set to be presented at the Association for Computing Machinery\u2019s Web Conference in Singapore this May, underscore that point: OpenAI\u2019s general-purpose GPT-3.5 and another AI program called MedAlpaca, which is trained on medical texts, are both more likely to produce incorrect responses to health care queries in Mandarin Chinese, Hindi and Spanish compared with English.\nIn a world where less than 20 percent of the population speaks English, these new findings show the need for closer human oversight of AI-generated responses in multiple languages\u2014especially in the medical realm, where misunderstanding a single word can be deadly. About 14 percent of Earth\u2019s people speak Mandarin, and Spanish and Hindi are used by about 8 percent each, making these\u00a0the three most commonly spoken languages\u00a0after English.\n\u201cMost patients in the world do not speak English, and so developing models which can serve them should be an important priority,\u201d says ophthalmologist Arun Thirunavukarasu, a digital health specialist at John Radcliffe Hospital and the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study. More work is needed before these models\u2019 performance in non-English languages matches what they promise the English-speaking world, he adds.\nIn the\u00a0new preprint study, researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology asked the two chatbots more than 2,000 questions similar to those typically asked by the public about diseases, medical procedures, medications, and other general health topics.* The queries in the experiment, chosen from three English-language medical datasets, were then translated into Mandarin Chinese, Hindi and Spanish.\nFor each language, the team checked whether the chatbots answered questions correctly, comprehensively and appropriately\u2014qualities that would be expected of a human expert\u2019s answer. The study authors used an AI tool (GPT-3.5) to compare generated responses against the answers provided in the three medical datasets. Finally, human assessors double-checked a portion of those evaluations to confirm the AI judge was accurate. Thirunavukarasu, though, says he wonders about the extent to which artificial intelligence and human evaluators agree; people can, after all, disagree over critiques of comprehension and other subjective traits. Additional human study of the generated answers would help clarify conclusions about chatbots\u2019 medical usefulness, he adds.\nThe authors found that according to GPT-3.5\u2019s own evaluation, GPT-3.5 produced more unacceptable replies in Chinese (23 percent of answers) and Spanish (20 percent), compared with English (10 percent). Its performance was poorest in Hindi, generating answers that were contradictory, not comprehensive or inappropriate about 45 percent of the time. Answer quality was much worse for MedAlpaca: more than 67 percent of the answers it generated to questions in Chinese, Hindi and Spanish were deemed irrelevant or contradictory. Because people might use chatbots to verify information about medications and medical procedures, the team also tested the AI\u2019s capability to distinguish between correct and erroneous statements; the chatbots performed better when the claims were in English or Spanish, compared with Chinese or Hindi.\n\nOne reason large language models, or LLMs (the text-generating technology behind these chatbots), generated irrelevant answers was because the models struggled to figure out the context of the questions, says Mohit Chandra, co-lead author of the study.\u00a0Scientific American\u00a0asked OpenAI and the creators of MedAlpaca for comment but did not receive a response by the time of this article\u2019s publication.\nMedAlpaca tended to repeat words when responding to non-English queries. For instance, when asked in Hindi about the outlook for chronic kidney disease, it started generating a general answer about the problems of the disease but went on to continuously repeat the phrase \u201cat the last stage.\u201d The researchers also noticed that the model occasionally produced answers in English to questions in Chinese or Hindi\u2014or did not generate an answer at all. These strange results might have occurred because \u201cthe MedAlpaca model is significantly smaller than ChatGPT, and its training data is also limited,\u201d says the study\u2019s co-lead author Yiqiao Jin, a graduate student at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\nThe team found that the answers in English and Spanish, compared with those in Chinese and Hindi, had better consistency across a parameter that artificial intelligence developers call \u201ctemperature.\u201d That\u2019s a value that determines the creativity of generated text: the higher an AI\u2019s temperature, the less predictable it becomes when generating a response. At lower temperatures, the models might respond to each health care question with, \u201cCheck with your health care professional for more information.\u201d (While this is a safe reply, it\u2019s perhaps not always a helpful one.) The comparable performance across model temperatures might be because of the similarity between English and Spanish words and syntax, Jin says. \u201cMaybe in the internal functioning of those models, English and Spanish are placed somewhat closer,\u201d he adds.\nThe overall worse performance in non-English languages may result from the way these models were trained, the study authors say. LLMs learn how to string words together from data scraped online, where most text is in English. And Chandra points out that even in nations where English isn\u2019t the majority language, it\u2019s the language of most medical education. The researchers think a straightforward way to tackle this might be to translate health care texts from English into other languages. But building multilingual text datasets at the huge quantities required to train LLMs is a major challenge. One option could be to leverage LLMs\u2019 own capability to translate between languages by designing specific models that are trained on English-only data and generate answers in a different language.\nBut this trick might not work neatly in the medical domain. \u201cOne of the problems human translators, as well as machine translation models, face is that the key scientific words are very hard to translate. You might know the English version of the particular scientific term, but the Hindi or Chinese version might be really different,\u201d says Chandra, who also notes that errors in the translation quality of texts in Chinese and Hindi could contribute to the LLM mistakes found in the study.\nAdditionally, Chandra says, it may be wise to include more medical experts and doctors, especially from the Global South, when training and evaluating these LLMs in non-English use. \u201cMost of the evaluations for health care LLMs, even today, are done with a homogeneous set of experts, which leads to the language disparity we see in this study,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe need a more responsible approach.\u201d\n",

        "text": "Dangers of artificial intelligence in medicine\nTwo of the most significant\u00a0predictions for the new decade\u00a0are that AI will become more pervasive, and the U.S. health-care system will need to evolve. AI can augment and improve the health-care system to serve more patients with fewer doctors.\u00a0\nHowever, health innovators need to be careful to design a system that enhances doctors\u2019 capabilities, rather than replace them with technology and also to avoid reproducing human biases.\nA recent study published in Nature (in collaboration with Google) reports that\u00a0Google AI\u00a0detects breast cancer better than human doctors. Babylon Health, the AI-based mobile primary care system implemented in the United Kingdom in 2013, is\u00a0coming to the U.S.\u00a0\nHealth-care is an industry in need of AI assistance due to a shortage of doctors and physician burnout.\u00a0\nDoctors in the U.S. are experiencing a\u00a0burnout crisis. Nearly 45 percent of physicians\u00a0report burnout, and the\u00a0physician suicide rate\u00a0is twice that of the general population. Research shows physicians experience burnout because of a poorly designed\u00a0health care system\u00a0that isn\u2019t intended to protect them or their patients.\u00a0\nPhysician burnout has been linked to increased\u00a0medical errors,\u00a0unprofessional behavior,\u00a0early retirement,\u00a0depression, and\u00a0racial bias.\u00a0\nIn 2019 the\u00a0Journal of the American Medical Association\u00a0published a study of 3,392 second-year resident physicians who self-identified as non-Black and found that symptoms of burnout were associated with explicit and implicit racial biases.\u00a0\nA study from the Mayo clinic reported\u00a0poorly designed electronic health\u00a0records as a contributor to physician burnout.\u00a0\nAnother major contributor to burnout is a shortage of physicians compared to the increased number and needs of patients that require care. The Association of American Medical Colleges\u00a0predicts a\u00a0shortage\u00a0of 21,100 and 55,200\u00a0primary care physicians by 2032.\u00a0\nWhile a possible solution, AI systems can also cause problems. Increased medical error is a real potential consequence of poorly designed AI in medicine.\u00a0\nMedical error is the\u00a0third leading cause of death\u00a0in the U.S., attesting to both the need for improving the system but also the fragility of the system and consequences of poor design.\u00a0\nEliminating the empathetic relationship is another potential consequence of poorly designed and integrated AI. Health care is built on a human-human link.\u00a0\nHumans desire and benefit from the problem-solving that comes from conversations. In clinics with electronic health records, physicians spend\u00a0about 27 percent of their time on patient care\u00a0and 52 percent time in the exam room interacting with the patient.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nReplacing humans with technology inappropriately could lead to complacency from physicians and reduced engagement from patients.\nAI could lead to new inequities and biases. Recent studies have shown that Black people are less likely to get\u00a0proper treatment for lung cancer\u00a0and\u00a0adequate treatment for pain\u00a0because of false beliefs about differences between Blacks and whites.\u00a0\nWhile some may conclude that AI would remove the biases that minorities receive by focusing on objective data, new research identifies inequities in AI systems.\u00a0\nA study published in Science in 2019 found that an algorithm used in U.S. hospitals\u00a0systematically discriminated against Black patients\u00a0by allocating less care to them.\nBabylon\u2019s\u00a0AI-based chatbot sparked concerns as the chatbots\u2019 safety has been\u00a0reported; Babylon\u00a0refutes these claims.\u00a0\nMany of the disruptive aspects of the AI system are unique to the National Health Service, which assigns patients to practitioners. With\u00a0new funding\u00a0and support, Babylon will enter the U.S. market. Health safety advocates need to be available to advocate for the unique needs of patients in the American health-care system.\u00a0\nFor AI systems to work without harm, a greater understanding of what clinicians do and their current biases is needed. The goal of designing systems that preserves what clinicians do best without the risk of complacency is critical.\u00a0\nBoth tech companies and health leadership are primarily comprised of white male staff that may not be trained to think about bias comprehensively. Diversifying the workforce of companies building AI systems and those innovating the health-care system is needed.\u00a0\nA recent report\u00a0found that people of color and women are underrepresented in the AI field, as about 80 percent of AI professors are men, and people of color are only a fraction of staff at major tech companies.\u00a0\nDiversifying the pipeline of researchers is essential; equally important is building inclusive workplaces and communities that allow under-represented minority researchers to thrive.\u00a0\nYes, well-designed AI in health-care systems can transform the health and well-being of members of society by allowing healthcare professionals to provide better quality care to more people and restoring balance to the people who dedicate their lives to providing care.\u00a0\nBut the danger is that AI systems that pit humans against algorithms will likely introduce new biases and errors into the U.S. health-care system that will not only exacerbate health disparities but also make health care more dangerous for everyone.\u00a0\n",

        "text": "The Dark Side of AI in Mental Health\nWith the rise in patient-facing psychiatric chatbots powered by artificial intelligence (AI), the potential need for patient mental health data could drive a boom in cash-for-data scams, according to mental health experts.\nA recent example of controversial data collection appeared on Craigslist when a company called Therapy For All allegedly posted an advertisement offering money for recording therapy sessions without any additional information about how the recordings would be used.\nThe company's advertisement and website had already been taken down by the time it was highlighted by\u00a0a mental health influencer on TikTok. However,\u00a0archived screenshots of the website\u00a0revealed the company was seeking recorded therapy sessions \"to better understand the format, topics, and treatment associated with modern mental healthcare.\"\nTheir stated goal was \"to ultimately provide mental healthcare to more people at a lower cost,\" according to the defunct website.\nIn service of that goal, the company was offering $50 for each recording of a therapy session of at least 45 minutes with clear audio of both the patient and their therapist. The company requested that the patients withhold their names to keep the recordings anonymous.\nThe website stated that the company was committed to providing \"top-quality therapy services\" for individuals. And the recordings would be used by its research team \"to learn more about approaches to mental healthcare.\"\nThere were no further details about how the company planned to use those recordings, and they did not respond to requests from\u00a0MedPage Today\u00a0to clarify their business model.\nHowever, experts suggested this is just one example of an unexpected incentive created from the growth of AI in mental healthcare.\nJohn Torous, MD, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, told\u00a0MedPage Today\u00a0that misuse of patient data related to AI models is an \"extremely legitimate concern,\" because large language models are only as good as their training data.\n\"Their chief weakness is they need vast amounts of data to truly be good,\" Torous said. \"Whoever has the best data will likely have the most practical or -- dare I say -- the best model.\"\nHe added that high-quality patient data is likely going to be the limiting resource for developing AI-powered tools related to mental healthcare, which will increase the demand and, therefore, the value of this kind of data.\n\"This is the oil that's going to power healthcare AI,\" Torous added.\n\"They need to have millions, if not billions, of examples to train on,\" he added. \"This is gonna become a bigger and bigger trend.\"\nTorous highlighted that mental healthcare technology companies have already been caught crossing this line with unethical use of patient-facing AI tools.\nFor example, in early 2023, nonprofit mental health platform\u00a0Koko\u00a0announced that it used OpenAI's GPT-3\u00a0to experiment with online mental health counseling\u00a0for roughly 4,000 people without their informed consent. The announcement, which came from the\u00a0CEO Rob Morris' X (formerly Twitter) account, highlighted the lack of understanding around ethical concerns related to patient consent from these companies, Torous said.\nAnother example, he noted, came when users of the text message-based mental health support tool\u00a0Crisis Text Line\u00a0learned that the company was\u00a0sharing their data with a for-profit AI sister company\u00a0called Loris.ai. Eventually, the company ended the relationship after\u00a0substantial backlash from its users.\nWhile concerns around patient data persist, there are also notable clinical implications for patient care and safety, according to Jacob Ballon, MD, MPH, of Stanford University in California.\n\"I would not want someone to do AI therapy on its own,\" he told\u00a0MedPage Today, adding that people seek out psychotherapy to help with complex, sometimes life-threatening, mental health conditions.\u00a0\"These are serious things that people are dealing with and to leave that to an unregulated, unmonitored chatbot is irresponsible and ultimately dangerous.\"\nBallon added that he doesn't think AI models are capable of producing the nuanced expertise needed to help individual patients address their unique mental health concerns. Even if a company could train their AI chatbot on enough high-quality patient data, it would not be able to appreciate the complexity of each patient, he noted.\nDespite those concerns, Torous thinks there will be growth in companies attempting to train AI models on patient data, whether it is collected ethically or not.\n\"There's probably going to be this whole world where I wonder if patients are going to be pressured or cajoled or convinced to give up their [personal health data],\" he said, predicting that the market for patient mental health data will only continue to grow in the coming years.\n",

The growth of AI in mental healthcare creates an incentive for companies to collect patient data, which can be misused. Large language models require vast amounts of data to be effective, making high-quality patient data a valuable resource. Mental healthcare technology companies have already been caught misusing patient data, such as Koko and Crisis Text Line. Experts warn that patient data may be collected unethically and used to train AI models. The clinical implications of relying on AI therapy are also concerning, as AI models may not be able to provide nuanced expertise to address complex mental health conditions. Despite these concerns, the market for patient mental health data is likely to continue growing.

        "text": "The hidden risk of letting AI decide \nAs artificial intelligence creeps further into people\u2019s daily lives, so do worries about it. At the most alarmist are concerns about AI\u00a0going rogue\u00a0and terminating its human masters.\nBut behind the calls for a\u00a0pause on the development of AI\u00a0is a suite of more tangible social ills. Among them are the risks AI poses to people\u2019s\u00a0privacy and dignity\u00a0and the inevitable fact that, because the algorithms under AI\u2019s hood are programmed by humans, it is just as\u00a0biased\u00a0and\u00a0discriminatory\u00a0as many of us. Throw in the\u00a0lack of transparency\u00a0about how AI is designed, and\u00a0by whom, and it\u2019s easy to understand why so much time these days is devoted to\u00a0debating its risks\u00a0as much as its potential.\nBut\u00a0my own research\u00a0as a psychologist who\u00a0studies how people make decisions\u00a0leads me to believe that all these risks are overshadowed by an even more corrupting, though largely invisible, threat. That is, AI is mere keystrokes away from making people even less disciplined and skilled when it comes to thoughtful decisions.\nMaking thoughtful decisions\nThe process of making thoughtful decisions involves three\u00a0common sense steps\u00a0that begin with taking time to understand the task or problem you\u2019re confronted with. Ask yourself, what is it that you need to know, and what do you need to do in order to make a decision that you\u2019ll be able to credibly and confidently defend later?\nThe answers to these questions hinge on actively seeking out information that both fills gaps in your knowledge and challenges your prior beliefs and assumptions. In fact, it\u2019s this\u00a0counterfactual information\u00a0\u2013 alternative possibilities that emerge when people unburden themselves of certain assumptions \u2013 that ultimately equips you to defend your decisions when they are criticized.\nThe second step is seeking out and considering more than one option at a time. Want to improve your quality of life? Whether it\u2019s who you vote for, the jobs you accept or the things you buy, there\u2019s always more than one road that will get you there. Expending the effort to actively consider and rate at least a few plausible options, and in a manner that is honest about the\u00a0trade-offs you are willing to make\u00a0across their pros and cons, is a hallmark of a thoughtful and defensible choice.\nThe third step is being willing to\u00a0delay closure\u00a0on a decision until after you\u2019ve done all the\u00a0necessary heavy mental lifting. It\u2019s no secret: Closure feels good because it means you\u2019ve put a difficult or important decision behind you. But the cost of moving on prematurely can be much higher than taking the time to do your homework. If you don\u2019t believe me, just think about all those times you let your feelings guide you, only to\u00a0experience regret\u00a0because you didn\u2019t take the time to think a little harder.\nDangers of outsourcing decisions to AI\nNone of these three steps are terribly difficult to take. But, for most, they\u2019re\u00a0not intuitive\u00a0either. Making thoughtful and defensible decisions\u00a0requires practice and self-discipline. And this is where the hidden harm that AI exposes people to comes in: AI does most of its \u201cthinking\u201d behind the scenes and presents users with answers that are stripped of context and deliberation. Worse, AI robs people of the opportunity to practice the process of making thoughtful and defensible decisions on their own.\nConsider how people approach many important decisions today. Humans are well known for being\u00a0prone to a wide range of biases\u00a0because we tend to be frugal when it comes to expending mental energy. This frugality leads people to like it when seemingly good or trustworthy\u00a0decisions are made for them. And we are\u00a0social animals\u00a0who tend to value the security and acceptance of their communities more than they might value their own autonomy.\nAdd AI to the mix and the result is a dangerous feedback loop: The data that AI is mining to fuel its algorithms is\u00a0made up of people\u2019s biased decisions\u00a0that also reflect the pressure of conformity instead of the wisdom of\u00a0critical reasoning. But because people like having decisions made for them, they tend to accept these bad decisions and move on to the next one. In the end, neither we nor AI end up the wiser.\nBeing thoughtful in the age of AI\nIt would be wrongheaded to argue that AI won\u2019t offer any benefits to society. It most likely will, especially in fields like\u00a0cybersecurity,\u00a0health care\u00a0and\u00a0finance, where complex models and massive amounts of data need to be analyzed routinely and quickly. However, most of our day-to-day decisions don\u2019t require this kind of analytic horsepower.\nBut whether we asked for it or not, many of us have already received advice from \u2013 and work performed by \u2013 AI in settings ranging from\u00a0entertainment\u00a0and\u00a0travel\u00a0to\u00a0schoolwork,\u00a0health care\u00a0and\u00a0finance. And designers are hard at work on\u00a0next-generation AI\u00a0that will be able to automate even more of our daily decisions. And this, in my view, is dangerous.\nIn a world where what and how people think is already under siege thanks to the\u00a0algorithms of social media, we risk putting ourselves in an even more perilous position if we allow AI to reach a level of sophistication where it can make all kinds of decisions on our behalf. Indeed, we owe it to ourselves to resist the siren\u2019s call of AI and take back ownership of the true privilege \u2013 and responsibility \u2013 of being human: being able to think and choose for ourselves. We\u2019ll feel better and, importantly, be better if we do.\n",

However, a more pressing issue is that AI may make people less disciplined and skilled at making thoughtful decisions. Making thoughtful decisions involves three steps: understanding the problem, considering multiple options, and delaying closure until all necessary thinking is done. These steps require practice and self-discipline, but AI can undermine this process by providing easy answers without context or deliberation. People are prone to biases and often prefer to have decisions made for them, which can lead to a dangerous feedback loop with AI. AI's algorithms are fueled by biased human decisions, and people tend to accept these decisions without critical thinking. While AI may offer benefits in certain fields, it's not necessary for most day-to-day decisions. Allowing AI to automate too many decisions can be dangerous and undermine human thinking and autonomy. It's essential to resist the temptation of AI and take back ownership of decision-making to think and choose for ourselves. By doing so, we'll feel better and be better as a result."

Of those, 40% said that led to feelings of frustration. In the UK, this frustration peaked at 50% of respondents.\n\nIn order to improve this interaction, an average of 34% of respondents said they felt using AI to assist in the clinical documentation process would be a good idea, ranging from 27% in Norway to 48% in Spain.\n\nWhen considering the age breakdown, respondents from younger age groups were more likely to agree AI would be beneficial. The percentage decreased with each age category from 43% of 18-to-24-year-olds to 26% of those aged 65 and over.\n\nAlthough the patients surveyed had not yet had any personal experience with AI in healthcare, respondents chose freeing up time for the clinician as the most compelling reason to use AI, with an average of 45% and peaking at 55% for German respondents.\n\nWhile the survey respondents broadly supported the use of AI, they also raised concerns about the use of AI in clinical settings, with 50% saying they were \u2018somewhat concerned\u2019. A further 32% were \u2018not very concerned\u2019 and 10% were \u2018not concerned\u2019.\n\nThe main cause for this concern was a lack of AI regulation at 34%, which increased to 46% in Germany and 48% in the UK.

We can accelerate and automate the workflows clinicians follow, and simplify the tasks that can draw their focus away from the patient. And we can tailor care pathways and treatments to the individual patient\u2019s unique needs.\u2019\n\nThe white paper also stated that \u2018this total focus on the most meaningful part of their role \u2013 working directly with patients \u2013 supports clinicians\u2019 professional satisfaction and reduces the likelihood of burnout\u2019.\n\nEarlier this year, the EU-funded METEOR Project highlighted widespread retention issues in Europe with 9% of doctors and nearly 14% of nurses declaring an intention to leave their profession, citing low job satisfaction, growing depersonalisation and emotional exhaustion as the primary factors.\n\nAnd the recent NHS staff survey revealed that 65.56% of medical and dental staff were unable to meet all the conflicting demands on their time at work.\n\nPrevious research from Nuance in 2022 revealed that NHS healthcare professionals in acute, mental and community health settings were spending an average of 13.5 hours per week generating clinical documentation \u2013 a 25% increase since 2015.\n\nConsultants were found to spend the longest on clinical documentation at 15.1 hours per week.\n\nA further 3.2 hours per week were spent out-of-hours by healthcare professionals on this task, according to the research.\n\nSome 68% of respondents said they felt it likely or very likely that their notes would be more complete if they had more time to complete them.\n",

        "text": "Warnings of a Dark Side to A.I. in Health Care\nLast year, the Food and Drug Administration approved a device that can capture an image of your retina and automatically detect signs of diabetic blindness.\nThis new breed of artificial intelligence technology is rapidly spreading across the medical field, as scientists\u00a0develop systems that can identify signs of illness and disease in a wide variety of images, from X-rays of the lungs to C.A.T. scans of the brain. These systems promise to help doctors evaluate patients more efficiently, and less expensively, than in the past.\nSimilar forms of artificial intelligence are likely to move beyond hospitals into the computer systems used by health care regulators, billing companies and insurance providers. Just as A.I. will help doctors check your eyes, lungs and other organs, it will help insurance providers determine reimbursement payments and policy fees.\nIdeally, such systems would improve the efficiency of the health care system. But they may carry unintended consequences, a group of researchers at Harvard and M.I.T. warns.\nIn a paper published on Thursday\u00a0in the journal Science, the researchers raise the prospect of \u201cadversarial attacks\u201d \u2014 manipulations that can change the behavior of A.I. systems using tiny pieces of digital data. By changing a few pixels on a lung scan, for instance, someone could fool an A.I. system into seeing an illness that is not really there, or not seeing one that is.\nSoftware developers and regulators must consider such scenarios, as they build and evaluate A.I. technologies in the years to come, the authors argue. The concern is less that hackers might cause patients to be misdiagnosed, although that potential exists. More likely is that doctors, hospitals and other organizations could manipulate the A.I. in billing or insurance software in an effort to maximize the money coming their way.\n\nSamuel Finlayson, a researcher at Harvard Medical School and M.I.T. and one of the authors of the paper, warned that because so much money changes hands across the health care industry, stakeholders are already bilking the system by subtly changing billing codes and other data in computer systems that track health care visits. A.I. could exacerbate the problem.\n\u201cThe inherent ambiguity in medical information, coupled with often-competing financial incentives, allows for high-stakes decisions to swing on very subtle bits of information,\u201d he said.\nThe new paper adds to a growing sense of concern about the possibility of such attacks, which could be aimed at everything from\u00a0face recognition services\u00a0and\u00a0driverless cars\u00a0to iris scanners and fingerprint readers.\nAn adversarial attack exploits a fundamental aspect of the way many A.I. systems are designed and built. Increasingly, A.I. is driven by\u00a0neural networks, complex mathematical systems that learn tasks largely on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data.\nBy analyzing thousands of eye scans, for instance, a neural network can learn to detect signs of diabetic blindness. This \u201cmachine learning\u201d happens on such an enormous scale \u2014 human behavior is defined by countless disparate pieces of data \u2014 that it can produce unexpected behavior of its own.\nIn 2016, a team at Carnegie Mellon\u00a0used patterns\u00a0printed on eyeglass frames to fool face-recognition systems into thinking the wearers were celebrities. When the researchers wore the frames, the systems mistook them for famous people, including Milla Jovovich and John Malkovich.\nA group of Chinese researchers pulled a similar trick by projecting infrared light from the underside of a hat brim onto the face of whoever wore the hat. The light was invisible to the wearer, but it could trick a face-recognition system into thinking the wearer was, say, the musician Moby, who is Caucasian, rather than an Asian scientist.\nResearchers have also warned that adversarial attacks could fool self-driving cars into seeing things that are not there. By making small changes to street signs, they have duped cars into detecting a yield sign instead of a stop sign.\nLate last year, a team at N.Y.U.\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering created virtual fingerprints capable of fooling fingerprint readers 22 percent of the time. In other words, 22 percent of all phones or PCs that used such readers potentially could be unlocked.\nThe implications are profound, given the increasing prevalence of biometric security devices and other A.I. systems. India has implemented the world\u2019s largest fingerprint-based identity system, to distribute government stipends and services. Banks are introducing face-recognition access to A.T.M.s. Companies such as Waymo, which is owned by the same parent company as Google, are testing self-driving cars on public roads.\nNow, Mr. Finlayson and his colleagues have raised the same alarm in the medical field: As regulators, insurance providers and billing companies begin using A.I. in their software systems, businesses can learn to game the underlying algorithms.\nIf an insurance company uses A.I. to evaluate medical scans, for instance, a hospital could manipulate scans in an effort to boost payouts. If regulators build A.I. systems to evaluate new technology, device makers could alter images and other data in an effort to trick the system into granting regulatory approval.\nIn their paper, the researchers demonstrated that, by changing a small number of pixels in an image of a benign skin lesion, a diagnostic A.I system could be tricked into identifying the lesion as malignant. Simply rotating the image could also have the same effect, they found.\nSmall changes to written descriptions of a patient\u2019s condition also could alter an A.I. diagnosis: \u201cAlcohol abuse\u201d could produce a different diagnosis than \u201calcohol dependence,\u201d and \u201clumbago\u201d could produce a different diagnosis than \u201cback pain.\"\nIn turn, changing such diagnoses one way or another could readily benefit the insurers and health care agencies that ultimately profit from them. Once A.I. is deeply rooted in the health care system, the researchers argue, business will gradually adopt behavior that brings in the most money.\nThe end result could harm patients, Mr. Finlayson said. Changes that doctors make to medical scans or other patient data in an effort to satisfy the A.I. used by insurance companies could end up on a patient\u2019s permanent record and affect decisions down the road.\nAlready doctors, hospitals and other organizations sometimes\u00a0manipulate the software systems\u00a0that control the billions of dollars moving across the industry. Doctors, for instance, have subtly changed billing codes \u2014 for instance, describing a simple X-ray as a more complicated scan \u2014 in an effort to boost payouts.\nHamsa Bastani, an assistant professor at the Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied the manipulation of health care systems, believes it is a significant problem. \u201cSome of the behavior is unintentional, but not all of it,\u201d she said.\nAs a specialist in machine-learning systems, she questioned whether the introduction of A.I. will make the problem worse. Carrying out an adversarial attack in the real world is difficult, and it is still unclear whether regulators and insurance companies will adopt the kind of machine-learning algorithms that are vulnerable to such attacks.\nBut, she added, it\u2019s worth keeping an eye on. \u201cThere are always unintended consequences, particularly in health care,\u201d she said.\n",

The highly regulated nature of our work, and the significant requirements around having supporting evidence for claims or decision-making, remind us that patient safety must always be top of mind.\nEvery AI model and use-case must be carefully considered.

Massive amounts of data have been properly structured and leveraged with a co-pilot approach to transform how healthcare works.\nHere are four areas where AI is making noticeable improvements in healthcare.\n#1: Automating Medical Record Reviews\nFor health plans, medical record reviews (MRR) are crucial for risk adjustment performance and improving member care. MRR is typically a tedious, costly process. It requires significant resources and manual human review which can hinder risk score accuracy and lead to worse health outcomes, higher costs, and false positives \u2013 records that seemingly have conditions to code, but are actually not qualified for risk adjustment.\nUntil now, this has been the only way to catch data discrepancies between medical documentation and claims data. However, AI and ML technologies are replacing the manual, error-prone nature of MRR with a better approach, combining clinical intelligence with natural language processing (NLP) to perform reviews faster and with greater accuracy.\nThis combined power of AI and NLP can analyze targeted member medical records and identify when intervention is needed, eliminating false positives \u2013 which health plans lose significant resources on each year. With NLP and ML-powered solutions, health plans can now reduce costs spent on MRR by focusing their team on true positives to improve risk score accuracy and member outcomes.\n#2: Identifying and Addressing Costly Coverage Errors\u00a0\nFor providers, claims payment in the back-end of their revenue cycle is largely dependent on front-end accuracy. But when patient coverage is missing or incorrect, access to care is delayed, back-end denials increase, and it takes extra resources to correct claims for payment.\nAI is helping providers get their revenue cycle started on the right foot, turning eligibility verification from inefficient and error-prone to a quick, more accurate, and automated process. AI-powered submissions separate good eligibility inquiries from those with missing information, sending only the inquiries with all required information to health plans. Health plans get cleaner batches of inquiries to verify, and incorrect inquiries are sent back to the provider to update.\nApplying AI and ML to eligibility verification empowers providers to correct costly mistakes and remove barriers to patient care. They get the information they need, while patients enjoy a better experience.\n#3: Optimizing Medication Adherence\u00a0\nFor pharmacies and hospitals, non-adherence to medication is costly, accounting for\u00a010% of hospitalizations\u00a0and\u00a016% of healthcare spending. For patients, it weakens the effectiveness of their care plan.\nThe challenge with medication adherence is there\u2019s no single mechanism. Patients may not be following their care plan for a variety of reasons, ranging anywhere from medication costs or lack of transportation to the pharmacy, to negative side effects or simply forgetting to take their medication.\nPharmacists, already pressed for time to consult patients, must take a unique approach with every patient to reduce the costs of non-adherence and improve patient care. AI is helping them monitor and optimize medication adherence by analyzing relevant patient data, such as health history and socioeconomic characteristics, and matching that data with the applicable prescription or treatment plan information. The result: a probability of patient adherence predicting whether patients will refill their prescriptions on time or not, and recommendations around adherence programs targeted for the patient, thus giving pharmacists greater efficiency throughout their day and more time to spend on patient consultation.\n#4: Harnessing the Power of Generative AI\u00a0\nGenerative AI can transform administrative and clinical processes throughout healthcare by analyzing and summarizing large volumes of data. Already, there have been examples of generative AI helping identify conditions and diagnoses, augmenting decision-making for clinicians, pharmacists, or providers.\nLarge language models\u2019 ability, scale, and speed are driving invaluable efficiency in healthcare, empowering treatment providers to spend more time with patients. It\u2019s making vast amounts of data easily accessible, keeping decision-makers informed and focused on the person in front of them. AI can also help keep users informed on treatment requirements and best practices for care.\nAI Success Depends on the Breadth, Depth, and Quality of Data\u00a0\nKeeping up with the rapid adoption of AI starts with well-laid data fundamentals. The transformative impact of AI hinges on the quality of data on which models are built, paired with the appropriate use-case. As large language models accelerate the use of AI and ML, healthcare organizations must implement AI models responsibly and ensure robust data architecture, data cleanliness, and of course, strict data governance.\nAs more AI and ML applications are deemed safe and reliable for care settings, the industry can improve healthcare outcomes and economics at scale. AI can help users achieve more, faster \u2013 and ultimately, improve the patient care journey throughout the care continuum.\n",

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, but its adoption poses unique challenges due to the industry's highly regulated nature and requirement for evidence-based decision-making. To ensure responsible implementation, AI models must be trained on large, representative datasets and adopted with a human-assisted and transparent approach. Despite these challenges, AI is already making a difference in healthcare, particularly in four key areas: automating medical record reviews, identifying and addressing costly coverage errors, optimizing medication adherence, and harnessing the power of generative AI. In medical record reviews, AI is replacing manual reviews with a more accurate and efficient approach, reducing costs and improving risk score accuracy. AI is also helping providers correct costly mistakes in eligibility verification, ensuring patients receive timely access to care. Additionally, AI is optimizing medication adherence by analyzing patient data and predicting the likelihood of patients refilling their prescriptions on time. Generative AI is transforming administrative and clinical processes by analyzing and summarizing large volumes of data, driving efficiency and informing decision-making. The success of AI in healthcare depends on the breadth, depth, and quality of data, and organizations must implement AI models responsibly and ensure robust data architecture and governance.

She hasn\u2019t had to lay off anyone, but the increase has forced her to cut back on shifts and be more stringent about overtime. She said she changes her menu offerings seasonally and raises prices more often since the wage boost.\n\u201cWhat it really forces you to do is make sure that nobody works more than 40 hours,\u201d Ms. Koteen said. \u201cYou can only cut back so many people before the service starts to suffer.\u201d\nMs. Koteen said she shelved plans to move her restaurant to a larger location. That would require her to hire more staff, and she isn\u2019t willing to take the risk with the unpredictability of her business. \u201cYou would just have no choice but to cut people at the bottom,\u201d she said.\nIn June, the city\u2019s unemployment rate was 4.3%, compared with the state\u2019s unemployment rate of 4%,\u00a0according to\u00a0the New York State Department of Labor. Both numbers have remained relatively steady during the past year.\nNew York City\u2019s minimum wage\u00a0has increased three times\u00a0for employers with at least 11 employees in the past three years. At the end of 2016, the hourly rate rose to $11 from $9 an hour. In 2018, the minimum wage jumped to $13 from $11 an hour. The rate will increase to $15 an hour for employers with 10 or fewer workers at the end of 2019.\nThe current federally mandated minimum wage is $7.25 an hour. Other states have passed $15-minimum-wage legislation, including Massachusetts, California, Maryland, Illinois, New Jersey and Connecticut.\nAnthony Advincula, spokesman for Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, which advocated for the $15 minimum wage, said there are other factors beyond higher wages that result in unsuccessful businesses, and owners shouldn\u2019t blame the boost for their struggles.\n\u201cIncreasing to $15 would reduce income inequality, and the number of individuals living in poverty now is ridiculously high,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not just a business issue, this is a race, gender, pay-equality issue.\u201d\nSarah McNally, owner of McNally Jackson Books, employs 75 people at four shops in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Ms. McNally said she hasn\u2019t cut hours or reduced the number of people she employs to mitigate the increase, but she is working to open two more shops and scale her workload to stay profitable.\nWhile Ms. McNally said she always has paid her employees at least $5 above minimum wage, January\u2019s increase tightened that gap. \u201cWith raising minimum wage to living wage, it feels now like we\u2019re at the bottom of the pay spectrum,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no benefit to being a retail business in New York.\u201d\nThomas Grech, president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce, said he has seen an uptick in small-business closures during the past six to nine months, and he attributed it to the minimum-wage legislation.\n\u201cThey\u2019re cutting their staff.

        "title": "The Minimum Wage is a Free Lunch With Hidden Charges",
        "text": "The Minimum Wage Is a Free Lunch With Hidden Charges\nIncreasing it exacerbates homelessness, improves health and leads to more smoking, just to name a few findings from the latest studies.\nOne of the biggest shifts in economic thinking in recent decades has involved minimum wages. In the 1970s and 1980s, the\u00a0consensus\u00a0among academic\u00a0economists\u00a0was that they destroyed jobs. Then empirical work in the 1990s began to show that this wasn\u2019t necessarily true, with\u00a0studies\u00a0of the low-wage\u00a0fast food industry\u00a0finding no negative impact on employment from minimum-wage increases. These inspired many critiques and\u00a0counter-studies\u00a0that did find negative employment effects. But overall, \u201ca rising fraction of researchers\u201d has concluded \u201cthat the employment effects of moderately sized minimum wage increases are quite close to zero,\u201d minimum-wage skeptic Jeffrey Clemens of the University of California at San Diego\u00a0conceded in 2021.\nGiven that the\u00a0wage\u00a0effects of raising the minimum wage are virtually always positive, this makes doing so look like the\u00a0supposedly nonexistent\u00a0free lunch. It\u2019s certainly popular with the American public, with 76% currently in favor of increasing the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $9 an hour,\u00a0according to Gallup, and 62% in favor (as of 2021) of a much bigger increase to $15,\u00a0according to the Pew Research Center. And while there appears to be no chance of either happening with Republicans in the majority in the House, the Economic Policy Institute\u00a0reports\u00a0that 22 US states and 38 cities and counties raised their minimum wages this month. The highest state minimum wage is now Washington\u2019s $16.28, and the highest local one is $20.29 (albeit for large employers only) in the Seattle suburb of Tukwila.\nSo that\u2019s good, right? Well \u2026 probably. As Clemens hinted with his word choices, economists still disagree about minimum wages. Their disagreements just focus now mainly on outcomes other than employment levels, plus no one is exactly sure what \u201cmoderately sized\u201d means.\nSince the beginning of 2023, by my count, at least 126 empirical studies or systematic reviews of the impact of minimum wages and minimum-wage increases have been either published in academic journals or posted as working papers. Among the findings were that minimum-wage increases were associated with:\nMore\u00a0homelessness.\nBetter\u00a0health, including\u00a0mental health.\nMore\u00a0property crime.\nParents spending\u00a0more time\u00a0with their children.\nMore people\u00a0smoking.\nHigher\u00a0bus ridership\u00a0near fast food restaurants.\nLower\u00a0community college enrollment\u00a0(but no change in the number of degrees).\nIn all, 52 papers reported findings that appeared to support minimum-wage increases, 37 reported negative findings and 37 had mixed or neutral results (or I just couldn\u2019t understand them). Ignore the positive results that mainly just confirmed that \u201cthe employment effects of moderately sized minimum wage increases are quite close to zero,\u201d and it was closer to an even split between positive and negative. Not that these numbers should be accorded a lot of weight \u2014 I found the papers by searching\u00a0EconPapers, the\u00a0Social Science Research Network\u00a0and\u00a0Google Scholar, and read at least the abstracts of all of them but didn\u2019t attempt to rate them by quality of data or research strategies. I did try to exclude findings based entirely on models or simulations, but a few may have slipped by.\nIt was a strange way to spend an afternoon, I\u2019ll admit. But the exercise made it much clearer to me where the primary areas of disagreement still are. The negative findings in the papers I looked at mainly had to do with the impact of minimum-wage increases on (1) those without jobs and (2) employer choices about hours, benefits, investments and other matters.\nThe chief criticism of minimum wages has long been that they make employers less likely to take chances on people low on experience and skills, and researchers continue to find evidence for this. One study\u00a0found\u00a0a \u201creduction in contracts for low-qualified training applicants\u201d in Germany after regional increases in minimum wages for apprentices younger than 18. Another\u00a0found that\u00a0increases in US\u00a0Adverse Effect Wage Rates\u00a0for farmworkers lead to \u201creduction in agricultural employment, especially for less-educated workers.\u201d Such non-hires may have a negative societal impact even if the number of people involved is quite small, which is the argument of the homelessness and property-crime studies cited above. Minimum wages also do nothing to help those unconnected to the labor market. A study of a large 2019 minimum-wage increase in Mexican border communities\u00a0found that\u00a0while the number of people in poverty declined, \u201cpoverty intensity increased, mainly because the policy did not affect the share of families without labor income among the poorest households.\u201d\nFor those with jobs, minimum-wage increases can bring higher wages \u2014 and not just for those at the minimum wage, with\u00a0one study\u00a0finding positive spillovers up to the middle of the wage distribution in Portugal \u2014 but also\u00a0reduced hours\u00a0and\u00a0cutbacks in health benefits. Other consequences within companies seem similarly mixed. A US study\u00a0found that\u00a0companies in minimum-wage-intensive industries cut back temporarily on capital investment after minimum-wage hikes, while a Chinese one\u00a0found that\u00a0companies overall increased spending on research and development. Less mixed is the evidence on labor productivity, which\u00a0usually\u00a0improves\u00a0after\u00a0minimum-wage increases, and on\u00a0prices, which also often\u00a0rise, especially at locally focused businesses\u00a0such as restaurants\u00a0that are able to pass increased labor costs on to consumers.\nIn sum, there are lots of trade-offs. Getting the benefits to exceed the costs depends in part on how big the minimum-wage increase is and from what base. Even minimum-wage\u00a0backers\u00a0agree that the costs of increasing the minimum wage may begin to exceed the benefits\u00a0somewhere\u00a0above 50% of the median or 60% of the mean wage. There isn\u2019t any risk of this with the current $7.25 federal minimum wage, which hasn\u2019t been raised since 2009 and is just 21% of the $34.27 that the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0reported\u00a0as the national mean hourly wage for private-sector workers in December and 33% of the BLS\u2019s\u00a0May 2022 estimate\u00a0of a $22.26 national median wage. It\u2019s below 50% of the median even in very poor areas such as\u00a0rural Mississippi.\nThe highest state minimum wages are another matter, especially outside big cities and their suburbs. Washington\u2019s $16.28 minimum is 60% of\u00a0the state\u2019s\u00a0May 2022 median wage and 47% of the mean \u2014 and 81% of the median and 65% of the mean in the\u00a0Yakima metropolitan area, a farming region just east of the Cascades. California\u2019s $16 minimum is 67% of the state median and 45% of the mean \u2014 and 88% of the median and 63% of the mean in\u00a0metropolitan Visalia-Porterville, a farming region in the San Joaquin Valley. That may be too high.\nInterestingly, the even-higher city and county minimum wages, which are found mostly in California, come off better under these criteria. The BLS doesn\u2019t publish wage estimates below the metropolitan-area level, but the Census Bureau has\u00a0estimates\u00a0of median annual earnings for full-time workers in 2022 for places with 65,000 or more residents. Of the top 25 for median earnings nationwide, 16 are in California. If you assume a 40-hour workweek, San Francisco\u2019s minimum wage of $18.07 is just 35% of the $51.19 median for full-time workers in the city, and Palo Alto\u2019s $17.80 just 24% of its $73.71 median. In such places, the increase in, say, restaurant prices that might result from a minimum-wage hike seems like a reasonable trade-off given how affluent most of the customers are. That\u2019s less clear in Los Angeles, where the minimum wage of $16.78 works out to 62% of the $27.21 median for full-time workers.\nSo is a minimum-wage increase a good idea? It depends \u2014 and the burgeoning of local wage ordinances in high-wage cities in recent years actually seems like a pretty reasonable approach to managing the trade-offs.\n",

        "summary": "The minimum wage has been a topic of debate among economists, with some arguing it destroys jobs and others finding no negative employment effects. Recent studies have shown that moderately sized minimum wage increases have virtually no impact on employment levels. Despite this, raising the minimum wage is still a contentious issue, with disagreements focusing on outcomes other than employment levels. A review of 126 empirical studies found mixed results, including associations with increased homelessness, better health, and more smoking. Some studies found negative effects on those without jobs and employer choices about hours, benefits, and investments. Minimum wages may also do nothing to help those unconnected to the labor market. For those with jobs, minimum wage increases can bring higher wages but also reduced hours and cutbacks in health benefits. The evidence on labor productivity and prices is also mixed, with some studies finding improvements and others finding increases. The effectiveness of minimum wage increases depends on the size of the increase and the base wage, with some arguing that costs may exceed benefits above 50% of the median wage. Local wage ordinances in high-wage cities may be a reasonable approach to managing the trade-offs of minimum wage increases."

        "text": "Clean Energy Jobs Grew At Twice The Rate Of US Jobs Overall Last Year\nThe clean energy sector added 142,000 jobs in 2023, accounting for more than half of new energy jobs and growing at a rate more than twice as large as that for the rest of the energy sector and the U.S. economy overall.\u00a0\nThe U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) released the 2024 U.S. Energy and Employment Report (USEER), a study designed to track and understand employment trends across the energy sector. As the private sector continues to announce major investments in American-made energy, the 2024 USEER shows that the energy workforce overall added over 250,000 jobs in 2023; 56% of those were in clean energy.\u00a0\nFor the first time, unionization rates in clean energy, at 12.4%, surpassed the average rate in the energy sector of 11%, driven by \u201crapid growth\u201d in unionized construction and utility industries, DOE said. The sectors experiencing the most growth include zero-emission vehicles and renewable energy, as well as transmission, distribution, and storage.\n\n\u201cOur policies are working. We are now starting to see the job impacts of investments made through the infrastructure and inflation reduction laws \u2013 first in construction and as America builds more of these factories, we\u2019ll see hundreds of thousands more,\u201d said\u00a0U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cThe data clearly show that clean energy means jobs \u2013 good jobs, union jobs, and jobs retained \u2013 in communities across the country as we race to dominate the global clean energy economy.\u201d\nThis year\u2019s report reflects a record number of survey responses from 42,000 businesses nationwide.\nKey takeaways\nIn 2023, clean energy was the driving factor for growth in the energy sector \u2013 jobs in clean energy grew by 4.2%, more than twice as much as the job growth rate of 2.0% in the overall economy.\nJobs in clean energy grew in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. In particular, Idaho had the fastest rate of clean energy job growth, increasing at 7.7%, followed by Texas at 6.0%, and New Mexico at 5.9%.\nBoth the solar and wind sectors reported strong job growth \u2013 jumping 5.3% and 4.5% respectively. Looking forward, DOE projects that the Inflation Reduction Act will double the share of electricity generation from clean sources by 2030, driven by growth in solar and wind. As the energy industry ramps up to meet this growth, construction is booming in many parts of the country. The energy construction sector added nearly 90,000 energy jobs, growing 4.5%, almost double the economy-wide construction employment growth of 2.3%.\nIn addition to jobs in energy infrastructure like renewable energy and grid upgrades, jobs resulting from the construction of domestic clean energy manufacturing and supply chain facilities were tracked for the first time this year. In addition to the 90,000 traditional energy construction jobs, the report found an additional 28,000 jobs in 2023 carrying out the work of building new battery and solar module factories, ports for offshore wind, and warehouses to store and transport clean energy products.\n\u201cThanks to the Biden-Harris administration\u2019s historic investments, clean energy jobs are booming in every single state,\u201d said\u00a0AFL-CIO president, Liz Shuler. \u201cWith union density in clean energy at record highs, it\u2019s clear we can create good jobs and advance a cleaner economy at the same time. And as the report shows, union labor makes a difference; employers report that working with unions has made it easier for them to find the skilled workers they need and hire a diverse workforce. We look forward to continuing to partner with Vice President Harris and the Department of Energy to ensure that clean energy jobs are good union jobs.\u201d\nAdditional highlights\nFrom 2022 to 2023, employment increased across all five USEER energy technology categories: electric power generation; energy efficiency; fuels; motor vehicles; and transmission, distribution, and storage.\n\nThe energy efficiency sector supported almost 2.3 million jobs in 2023, adding nearly 75,000 positions from the year before \u2013 the most of any sector. Energy efficiency includes the installation of several home energy improvements now eligible for tax breaks under the IRA, and the 3.4% growth rate was the strongest showing since 2018.\nVeterans accounted for 9% of the U.S. energy workforce, greater than their representation in the overall U.S. workforce, and the energy workforce is younger than average, with 29% of workers below the age of 30. Latino and Hispanic workers held nearly one-third of the new energy jobs created in 2023, growing by 79,000 workers.\nThe energy industry sectors experiencing the highest job growth from 2022 to 2023 were utilities and construction. The utilities sector saw the fastest employment growth of 5.0% in 2023, adding nearly 30,000 jobs. The construction sector added nearly 90,000 energy jobs, growing 4.5%, almost double the economy-wide construction employment growth of 2.3%.\nClean energy technologies accounted for 79% of net new electric power generation employment, adding 28,086 jobs. Wind and solar employment grew at rates well above average, and solar jobs became more demographically diverse and more heavily unionized.\nMotor vehicle jobs are growing, and the most rapid growth is in zero-emission vehicles. Nationwide, jobs in motor vehicles grew, with clean vehicle employment increasing 11.4%, adding 24,826 jobs.\u00a0\nState data\nTexas (969,801), California (932,273), Michigan (401,720), Florida (351,934), and Ohio (333,110) have the greatest number of energy jobs in the United States. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nCalifornia (545,207), Texas (261,934), New York (177,202), Florida (172,115), and Illinois (130,473) have the greatest number of clean energy jobs.\nAlabama (9.6%), Utah (7.8%), and North Carolina (6.9%) had the fastest rate of energy job growth from 2022 to 2023.\n\nA recent report from DOE\u2019s National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) identified\u00a0impactful opportunities to close the wind energy workforce gap, although there will likely be a significant shortage of wind energy workers in the coming decades.\nThe report says industry and educational institutions should collaborate to help students build awareness of wind industry opportunities. 60% of students reported a lack of exposure to the wind energy industry within their coursework, and 59% of wind energy firms reported no partnerships with educational institutions to find applicants for internships, apprenticeships, or job candidates.\nEarlier this year, DOE announced a\u00a0$24 million funding opportunity\u00a0for workforce training programs with a focus on training in clean energy jobs that do not require a four-year degree. This funding, from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Is meant to further expand the existing Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC) network to include more union training programs, community colleges, and trade schools. These IACs support the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s goals of growing our clean energy workforce and boosting the economy by helping small and midsized manufacturers (SMMs) identify opportunities to save costs and increase productivity.\nThe centers will build on the recent\u00a0round\u00a0of IAC network expansion to train students and incumbent workers for careers in clean energy, energy efficiency, and advanced manufacturing that do not require a four-year degree; and help small and midsized manufacturers (SMMs) save money, reduce energy waste, and improve productivity.\n",
