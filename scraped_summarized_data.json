If granted work authorization, the tax contribution by the group would increase by nearly 42%, from $96.7 billion to $136.9 billion, says the new study released Tuesday by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. Immigrants lacking legal status in Utah contributed some $235.1 million in state and local taxes in 2022, the report says. The figure would increase by 24.4% to $292.5 million if they received work authorization. \"The bottom line here is that regardless of immigration status, we all contribute by paying our taxes,\" Marco Guzman, senior policy analyst for ITEP and co-author of the study, said in a statement. The \"economic ripple effects\" of the population, ITEP said, \"would likely reveal undocumented immigrants to have an even larger significance to public revenues than is documented here.\" Nevertheless, the new report from the non-profit, Washington, D.C.-based tax policy organization is hardly the only take on the topic. It is the focus of intense debate as U.S. lawmakers try to get a handle on illegal border crossings into the country via Mexico. The Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization that views immigration issues through a more conservative lens, says immigrants lacking legal status are \"a net drain\" on the U.S. economy. Yes, they pay taxes, but one researcher told a U.S. House subcommittee in January the cost of government benefits immigrants tap into surpasses their contributions, resulting in a \"fiscal drain\" of around $68,000 per immigrant who lacks legal status, over the course of their life. \"Illegal immigrants have a negative fiscal impact — taxes paid minus benefits received — primarily because a large share have modest levels of education, resulting in relatively low average incomes and tax payments, along with significant use of means-tested programs and other government services,\" Steven Camarota, the CIS director of research, said in testimony to a House Judiciary Committee subcommittee on immigration on Jan. 11. Still, even the well-researched contentions from the center don't offer a neat-and-tidy end to debate on the thorny issue. The $68,000 figure is an extrapolation of data from a 2017 study on the fiscal impact of all immigrants, authorized or not, by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. Contrary to the Center for Immigration Studies' determination, the 2017 study summary offered an upbeat assessment of the economic impact of immigrants, at least over the long haul. \"First-generation immigrants are more costly to governments than are the native-born, but the second generation are among the strongest fiscal and economic contributors in the U.S. This report concludes that immigration has an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the U.S.,\" it states. Tax revenue coming in The new study from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy estimates undocumented immigrants paid $59.4 billion in taxes to the federal government in 2022 and $37.3 billion to state and local governments, accounting for the estimated $96.7 billion total. \"In other words, for every 1 million undocumented immigrants who reside in the country, public services receive $8.9 billion in additional tax revenue,\" the study reads. The collective contribution amounted to 26.1% of the population's overall income in 2022 — on par with the 26.4% figure for median-income earners in the country. Social Security taxes accounted for the largest chunk of funds paid to the feds, totaling $25.7 billion. Sales and excise taxes on purchases accounted for the biggest chunk of local and state taxes paid, some $15.1 billion, the report said. Granting \"work authorization\" — a controversial notion — would boost the $96.7 billion figure to $136.9 billion \"both because their wages would rise and because their rates of tax compliance would increase,\" the institution reports. The report doesn't provide an estimate of the value of government services tapped by immigrants who don't have work authorization. The Center for Immigration Studies, by contrast, put a big focus on the area. \"Based on government data, we estimate that 59% of households headed by illegal immigrants use one or more major welfare programs, compared to 39% of households headed by the U.S.-born,\" Camarota said in the report. The center's figures, though, include benefits and services going to U.S. citizens — the U.S.-born children of those without work authorization. \"The high use of welfare by illegal-immigrant-headed households is due to several factors. First, and most important, more than half of all illegal immigrant households have at least one U.S.-born child on behalf of whom they can receive benefits,\" Camarota said in his testimony. Camarota also noted that some states offer Medicaid benefits to some immigrants without work authorization and that \"illegal immigrant children\" can get free and subsidized lunches at public schools.",

In Utah, immigrants without legal status contributed $235.1 million in state and local taxes in 2022, which would increase by 24.4% to $292.5 million with work authorization. The study found that the economic impact of undocumented immigrants would likely be even larger than documented. The Center for Immigration Studies, a conservative research organization, disagrees, saying that immigrants without legal status are a \"net drain\" on the US economy. According to CIS, the cost of government benefits used by immigrants exceeds their tax contributions, resulting in a \"fiscal drain\" of around $68,000 per immigrant over their lifetime. However, the CIS figure is based on a 2017 study that found immigrants have an overall positive impact on long-run economic growth in the US. The ITEP study found that undocumented immigrants paid $59.4 billion in federal taxes and $37.3 billion in state and local taxes in 2022. Social Security taxes accounted for the largest chunk of federal taxes paid, while sales and excise taxes accounted for the largest chunk of state and local taxes. Granting work authorization would increase tax revenue due to increased wages and tax compliance."

        "text": "As part of the League of Women Voters’ efforts to educate and inform voters on the many policy issues that are being discussed this election season, we’re shining a light on immigration. Significantly more Americans name immigration as the most important problem facing the U.S. according to a Gallup poll in June. However, there’s a lot of disinformation fueling unfounded “immigration antagonism.”  We’ve seen this on the debate stage, and when candidates and TV pundits speak with hostility offering up a myriad of disinformation about immigrants. Facts may help dispel some of these slanderous opinions. One of the nastiest lies is falsely smearing immigrants as criminals. Immigrants, regardless of citizenship status, are 60% less likely to be incarcerated for committing crimes than U.S.-born citizens, according to research by Stanford economist Ran Abramitzky. Immigration opponents claim immigrants are a drain on the economy and on government resources. False. Immigrants are particularly ambitious and hardworking. They are 80% more likely to start a new business than U.S.-born citizens. Research by the American Immigration Council finds that nearly half of today’s Fortune 500 companies were founded by either immigrants or the children of immigrants, including four of the top 12 companies. Impressively, immigrant-founded businesses comprise 103 companies in last year’s Fortune 500. Silicon Valley companies employ thousands of immigrants who have been highly successful, working as entrepreneurs and employees in technology. Including, creating lifesaving robotics used in surgeries worldwide. Many of these migrants are critical to our health. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2021 American Community Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show that immigrants account for more than 26% of physicians and surgeons. Forty percent of personal care aides are immigrants as are about a fifth of nursing assistants. Approximately, 1.6 million immigrants are working as doctors, registered nurses, dentists, pharmacists or dental hygienists. According to Phil Swagel, the director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, estimates that new immigrants will add about $7 trillion dollars to America’s economy over the next decade. This includes about $1 trillion in tax revenues that will help shrink, not grow, the deficit. The libertarian Cato Institute found that new immigrants pay $1.38 in taxes for every dollar of benefits they receive. U.S. born residents pay around 69 cents for every dollar of benefits they receive. Another common anti-newcomer misconception is that immigrants are taking away jobs. Immigrants are not taking away jobs that Americans want. Undocumented immigrants in particular are doing some of the most dangerous, difficult, low-paying and essential jobs in the country, while the U.S. enjoys record-low unemployment. Young migrants will play a large role to help keep Social Security strong, as the nation ages and the Baby Boomers move into retirement. Immigrants add immeasurably to the richness of American culture. We need immigrants to keep our economy, and our country, vibrant and growing. Yes, we need to develop comprehensive immigration reform and, please, also remember that immigration policy covers newcomers from every country outside the U.S. In an election year when immigration is a partisan issue, we should remember the profound difference immigrants have made and continue to make in our lives. They are not “poisoning the blood of our country.” They’re revitalizing and restoring it. Be an educated voter. From the timeless words of Thomas Jefferson: “We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.” Please, make a plan to vote.

This is when J1 visa-holders, often young Irish people, are in town. The J1 visa program allows young people to work and travel in the US for a few months. Many Irish students take advantage of this program to spend their summer breaks in the US. Chicago is a popular destination for these visa-holders due to its strong Irish heritage. The city's Irish roots are evident in its many Irish pubs and cultural events. During the summer, the city's Irish population swells with young people from Ireland. They come to Chicago to work, socialize, and experience American culture. This influx of young Irish people brings a lively energy to the city's Irish neighborhoods. For a few months, Chicago is even more Irish than usual, thanks to the J1 visa-holders."

        "text": "The US economy will keep growing and ultimately avoid a recession thanks to artificial intelligence, immigration, and rich people. That's according to State Street chief investment strategist Michael Arone, who said in a recent note that even as the Federal Reserve keeps monetary policy in restrictive territory via high interest rates, that won't be enough to send the economy into a tailspin. \"The risks are growing that the stubborn Fed gradually then suddenly puts the economy in recession,\" he said. \"But the economy may narrowly escape the dreaded recession outcome for these three reasons.\" Even though AI technologies are in the early innings, Arone says they hold a lot of promise for boosting economic productivity, increasing company profits, and igniting further growth for businesses. \"Recent studies assert that AI can improve productivity across a wide range of jobs by 20% to 80%. That compares favorably to another general-purpose technology, steam power,\" he said. Arone notes that steam power sparked the Industrial Revolution, and that technology increased productivity by just 18% to 22% when it was installed in factories. If AI can improve productivity by a multiple of that, it could unlock significant economic benefits in the future — and those benefits should more than outweigh any policy mistake by the Fed, Arone said. Americans can thank immigrants for the continued progress in battling inflation, according to Arone. \"Many people underappreciated the role that increasing immigration has played in stabilizing the post-pandemic labor market without further flattering inflationary pressures,\" he said. Wage inflation soared during the early days of the pandemic, which stoked overall inflation to a cycle peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But the influx of more than 1.5 million immigrants in 2023 helped balance out supply and demand in the labor market, Arone said. \"The pace of immigration increases over the past couple of years is consistent with past economic expansions. And, with job openings remaining elevated in immigrant-dependent service industries, participation rates are likely to increase over the next two years, further boosting the labor market,\" he said. Arone also notes that the increase in immigrants can have a compounding impact on the US economy overtime. He says while this set of workers will typically take low-skill service jobs upon their arrival in the country, some of them will become entrepreneurs and stoke innovation, consumption, and fiscal contributions. For all the concerns about rising delinquency rates and more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, Arone says the high-income cohort of the US population is in strong financial shape. He says that's important because people who earn $150,000 or more are responsible for a 40% of US consumer spending. \"They own 85% of stocks, 80% of bonds, and two-thirds of liquid assets. Yet, they only make up about one-third of consumer credit card balances,\" Arone said, citing data from Empirical Research Partners. This demographic is on pace to see their wages grow 5% this year, and they are expected to increase their spending by 8% this year, which could be even higher if inflation continues to fall and stock and home prices continue to rise, Arone said. \"In a departure from past periods, higher stock and home prices combined with a significant increase in their interest income has enabled top earners to spend solidly throughout this tighter monetary policy cycle,\" he said. Taken together, this suggests to Arone that the US economy is on track for solid growth in the coming quarters and will ultimately avoid a recession, and that should enable a continued rise in the stock market. \"A restrictive Fed won't stop the music this time around because the economy's moving to a new rhythm,\" he said.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Economists say that one of the best ways to reduce inflation is to increase immigration, which can be done through expanding legal channels for temporary workers and admitting more family and employment-based immigrants. If polls are correct, that should be fine with Americans. Sixteen percent of registered voters labeled “inflation/cost of living” the most important issue facing the country today, according to a recent Fox News poll, compared to 5% who considered “immigration/border security” the country’s top issue. Also, research shows that increased legal admissions can reduce illegal entry. The latest economic news shows a continued strong demand for labor. That a lack of immigrants can contribute to inflation and harm Americans by reducing their purchasing power is not a new topic for economists. “The net effect of immigration on natives’ purchasing power . . . depends not only on wage but also on price effects,” according to research in 2008 by economist Patricia Cortes (Boston University Questrom School of Business). Cortes used confidential microdata from the Consumer Price Index and estimated the impact of low-skilled immigration on consumer prices. “I find that, at current immigration levels, a 10 percent increase in the share of low‐skilled immigrants in the labor force decreases the price of immigrant‐intensive services, such as housekeeping and gardening, by 2 percent,” writes Cortes. She found wage impacts mostly fell on other immigrants. “Low-skilled natives and low-skilled immigrants are far from being perfect substitutes [in production] . . . therefore, a low-skilled immigration shock should affect mostly the wages of other low-skilled immigrants and have little effect on the wages of low-skilled natives.” Cortes found to the extent that there were adverse wage effects, they fell on “the wages of native Hispanics with low English proficiency than on the wages of other low-skilled native groups.” The most recent economic news has renewed the spotlight on employer needs for more workers. “Hiring strengthened in April, showing the job market is resilient amid banking turmoil, rising interest rates and high inflation,” reported the Wall Street Journal (May 5, 2023). “Employers added 253,000 jobs in April, the best gain since January, the Labor Department said Friday. The jobless rate fell to 3.4% last month, matching the lowest reading since 1969. A historically low unemployment rate kept pressure on wages, which grew 4.4% in April from a year earlier. That was slightly higher than a 4.3% annual increase in March.” The Federal Reserve Board has closely watched each jobs report in evaluating what actions to take to tame inflation. “The jobs report does little to clarify the outlook for Federal Reserve policy because officials will have one more employment report before their June 13-14 meeting and because they are paying closer attention to banking stress,” according to the Wall Street Journal. (Note: The article was updated to reflect the latest jobs report from the Department of Labor.) The situation America found itself in after Trump administration policies and the Covid-19 pandemic was not an immigration “shock” but a significant decline in admissions. In a November 30, 2022, speech at the Brookings Institution, Jerome Powell said, “In the labor market, demand for workers far exceeds the supply of available workers, and nominal wages have been growing at a pace well above what would be consistent with 2 percent inflation over time.” said Powell. “Thus, another condition we are looking for is the restoration of balance between supply and demand in the labor market.” Powell named “excess retirements” a factor contributing to the labor shortfall. “The second factor contributing to the labor supply shortfall is slower growth in the working-age population,” he said. “The combination of a plunge in net immigration and a surge in deaths during the pandemic probably accounts for about 1-1/2 million missing workers.” A footnote in the speech (highlighted by Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell) dealt with Donald Trump’s immigration policies. “Due, at least in part, to pandemic-related restrictions on entry into the United States, total immigration has slowed substantially since the start of the pandemic, lowering the labor force by about 1 million people relative to pre-pandemic trends,” according to the footnote. “While lawful, nonpermanent immigration (for example, H-1B and H-2B visa holders) has bounced back considerably since earlier in the pandemic, these categories of immigration are generally still below 2019 levels. Meanwhile, lawful permanent immigration (that is, new green card holders) is also somewhat lower than in 2019 and well below levels that prevailed earlier in the 2010s.” Economists Giovanni Peri and Reem Zaiour estimated that due to the pandemic and U.S. immigration policies under the Trump administration, there were 2 million fewer working-age immigrants. “Inflation occurs when the demand for goods and services grows faster than supply,” said Mark Regets, a labor economist and a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy. “Increasing our ability to produce by increasing the supply of labor is the least painful way to control inflation.” Opponents of immigration generally argue that labor shortages are inherently good, a belief economists would attribute to a lack of understanding of economics, particularly the concept of real wages and the interests of individuals as consumers. “Real income, also known as real wage, is how much money an individual or entity makes after adjusting for inflation,” according to the definition provided by Investopedia. In addition to other negative impacts, such as less economic growth, an insufficient number of workers can lead to inflation. When real wages are lower, workers cannot buy as much with their earnings. A recent study explored how inflation, immigration and real wages are connected. “To achieve higher real wages while reducing inflation and encouraging employment, the U.S. must either increase labor force participation and expand training or increase the pool of workers available through the admission of foreign workers,” according to professors Justin Gest (George Mason University) and R. Andrew Butters (Indiana University) in research for FWD.us. “The only other remedy is for a recession to cool demand and reduce the pressure to hire—a resolution few will favor.” “It’s well-established that immigrants fill labor shortages, promote economic growth and stimulate entrepreneurship and innovation,” wrote Gest in the Wall Street Journal. “Our discovery of the link between migration and inflation highlights the way that immigrants also help labor markets be more responsive to local changes in demand and supply. The pandemic gave the Trump administration the opportunity to experiment with a zero-immigration future. It didn’t go well for anyone.”  One Community.

A member of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang was arrested in a tiny Wisconsin community for allegedly sexually assaulting a mother and abusing her daughter after he had been arrested and released earlier this year in Minneapolis.  Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, whose grandchildren live less than a mile away from the Prairie du Chien home where the mother and daughter were held against their will and repeatedly victimized, told Fox News Digital that it was only a matter of time before tragedy would strike the community amid the White House's open-border policies and sanctuary city initiatives.  Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate, 26, assaulted the woman and child \"under particularly brutal circumstances,\" and attacked his victims \"over the course of a period of time,\" Prairie du Chien Police Chief Kyle Teynor said at a September 9 press conference following Coronel Zarate's arrest.  Coronel Zarate was charged with sexual assault, battery, strangulation, suffocation, false imprisonment, child abuse and disorderly conduct in Crawford County Court on Wednesday, WXOW reported. He remains in Crawford County Jail on $10,000 cash bond. VENEZUELAN GANG TREN DE ARAGUA TAKE OVER TEXAS HOTEL, COUNTY OFFICIALS WORK TO SHUT DOWN BUSINESS Venezuelan migrant Alejandro Jose Coronel Zarate was charged with sexual assault, battery, strangulation, suffocation, false imprisonment, child abuse and disorderly conduct by Prairie du Chien Police earlier this month.  (Crawford County Jail) The mother later told police that Coronel Zarate had also assaulted her on September 4, according to a criminal complaint. During that incident, she told police, Coronel Zarate allegedly told her, \"I get away with it. I'm a criminal.\" Teynor said that Coronel Zarate had tattoos associating him with Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, which originated in the country's prisons and has since grown a foothold in several areas across the United States.  Members are accused of a series of high-profile crimes across the U.S., including the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley and the shooting of two NYPD officers during an arrest in June. \"I don’t care what your political affiliation is. This is not a Democrat issue. It’s not an independent or Libertarian issue. This is a human-rights issue,\" Van Orden said at the Sept. 9 press conference. \"American citizens’ human rights are being violated.

Van Orden clarified that he was not opposed to legal immigrants, or immigrants who come to the country on temporary agricultural worker visas, noting that Wisconsin's farming industries rely on migrants.  \"If we don't have immigrant labor, our dairies, our farms will go out of business. Our dairies will close if we don't have immigrant labor. I absolutely 100% welcome immigrant labor if they want to come here and work and send remittances back,\" he said. \"But letting someone into the country with tattoos associated with known immigrant gangs is not OK. We do not welcome criminal illegal immigrants to come here.\" Prairie du Chien police confirmed that Zarate had entered the country in September 2023 at or near the El Paso, Texas point of entry.

They let a guy in the country with gang tattoos, and you get a medical screening before you come over the border. They give them a medical exam, because they don't want people coming over with tuberculosis,\" Van Orden said incredulously.  The former Navy SEAL said the attack had shaken his small community, but said it was only a matter of time until migrant crime would strike there. \"Why should a town of 5,500 people . . . be afraid of letting their kids play in their front yard?\" Van Orden said. \"It wasn't like this three years ago.\" The gang member's Prairie du Chien arrest was not his first run-in with police. In November 2023, he was detained for allegedly receiving stolen property but was subsequently released.  \"Zarate got rolled up for property crimes in Minneapolis and Minnesota that are controlled by [Governor] Tim Walz,\" Van Orden said. \"They let him go because of the sanctuary city policies.\" SUSPECTED TREN DE ARAGUA GANG MEMBERS IN AURORA, COLORADO, RELEASED ON $1,000 BOND These images from a Customs and Border Protection intelligence bulletin show tattoos and identifiers for Tren De Aragua.  A warrant was issued for his arrest in Wisconsin's Dane County on Dec. 1 for strangulation/suffocation, false imprisonment, battery and disorderly conduct. In addition to federal policies, Van Orden blamed Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett, a Democrat, for the incident earlier this month.  \"Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett bears a tremendous amount of responsibility personally, and that's just a fact,\" Van Orden told Fox News Digital. \"What [he] cannot deny is that they issued a warrant for Mr. Zarate for strangulation, false imprisonment, battery and disorderly conduct. That warrant came out of his office – if he spent more time fighting crime as opposed to complaining about a Republican on his Facebook page, he would have been detained, and a mother and daughter wouldn't have spent several days being sexually assaulted.\" Van Orden and Republican Rep. Tom Tiffany penned a letter to Barrett earlier this month demanding answers regarding the warrant for Coronel Zarate.  \"Given that Dane County was classified as ‘non-cooperative’ with federal immigration authorities as recently as June of this year by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Reps. Tiffany and Van Orden wrote to ask for additional information regarding Dane County law enforcement’s interaction with Mr. Coronel Zarate,\" read a release from the two Congress members.

This inquiry is an insult to the brave men and women of our Sheriff’s Office who courageously put their lives on the line in service to their community,\" Barrett wrote in an email.  \"To the authors of this inquiry, please aim your political theatrics in a different direction as you try to recover from the thorough, factual and strategic dismantling of your presidential candidate by VP Kamala Harris,\" Barrett said. \"To save any follow-up inquiries, we have not taken reports of people eating cats or dogs.\" Christina Coulter is a U.S. and World reporter for Fox News Digital.

Coronel Zarate was charged with multiple crimes, including sexual assault, battery, and child abuse. He had been arrested and released earlier in Minneapolis due to sanctuary city policies. Republican Rep. Derrick Van Orden, whose grandchildren live near the crime scene, blamed the White House's open-border policies and sanctuary city initiatives for the incident. Van Orden said it was only a matter of time before tragedy would strike the community. Coronel Zarate had tattoos associating him with the Tren de Aragua gang, which has been linked to several high-profile crimes in the US. Van Orden stated that he is not opposed to legal immigrants, but rather criminal illegal immigrants who commit heinous crimes. The gang member's arrest was not his first run-in with police, as he was detained in November 2023 for allegedly receiving stolen property but was released. Van Orden blamed Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett, a Democrat, for the incident, saying he bore responsibility for the mother and daughter's ordeal.

(AP Photo/Marco Ugarte, File)AP A new report by the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the recent surge of immigration will have positive effects on the U.S. economy even ten years into the future. CBO analyzed the estimated surge in migrants (about 8.7 million) from 2021 to 2026 and the incremental impacts it will have as it boosts economic activity through 2034. The report’s findings contrast with several recent polls that show rising anti-immigrant sentiment across the country as Election Day approaches. “With fewer than 100 days left in the presidential campaign, the stakes could not be higher and the contrasts couldn’t be more sharp or consequential,” said Vanessa Cárdenas, the executive director of the nonprofit America’s Voice. “The right wing portrayal of immigration and immigrants as a national extinction-level crisis is telling and ugly. As an organization, our ‘candidate’ is immigration reform and fighting for an America that recognizes immigrants and immigration as national strengths.” The report mirrored already-existing studies that show how immigration boosts the American economy and wages. According to CBO’s reasoning, migrant taxes outweigh the cost of social services and will increase federal revenue by $1.2 trillion, stimulating the economy in addition to mandatory spending and interest on debt. “This is a very good time to expand legal immigration, make it a more orderly and an employment-driven process and benefit from it,” University of California, Davis researcher Giovanni Peri told Forbes. But a new poll shows that more U.S. adults want to decrease immigration. It is the first time since 2005 that the majority of respondents (55 percent) indicated that sentiment. According to a February Gallup poll, nearly 30 percent of Americans rank immigration as their top issue this election. Gallup researchers said the shift in attitude may be attributable to unauthorized border crossings reaching record-breaking numbers late last year. Though levels have dropped significantly, they still remain above pre-pandemic levels. Anti-immigrant sentiment was highest in the early to mid-1990s when California received a surge of migrants and after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Polling shows 64 percent of Americans presently view immigration negatively — down from 77 percent in 2020 but higher than 52 percent in 2001. Researchers said negative views have largely been driven by Republicans. One-quarter of registered voters said a candidate must share their views on immigration to gain their vote, with Republicans more likely to feel this way.

Immigrants participate and contribute to their communities, grow the economy, pay taxes and make our neighborhoods stronger,” said Heidi Altman, the director of federal advocacy at the National Immigration Law Center. “We need policymakers to reject rhetoric around immigration that is rooted in fear; this rhetoric is not only dangerous, it leads to bad policy that causes grave harm and exacerbates existing problems.” The CBO report also found that increases in immigration tend to raise state and local governments’ spending — mostly on education, health care, and housing — more than their revenues, but also found that most new arrivals are under 55 years old and thus of working age. They are likely to participate in the labor force, which will increase local economic growth, according to the CBO. In total, migrants in the surge population will pay about $788 billion in income and payroll taxes through the 10-year period. The agency anticipates that the effects on revenues and mandatory spending will continue growing well beyond 2034.

Alex Padilla about suspected ISIS terrorists crossing the U.S.-Mexico border June 12, 2024. The head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is warning that it is \"quite common\" for illegal immigrants to arrive at the southern border with no information about them on record after authorities nabbed eight Tajikistan nationals with ties to ISIS who allegedly crossed the southern border. Acting ICE Director Patrick Lechleitner was asked by NewsNation in an interview about the bust of the eight foreign nationals. All eight Tajikistan nationals allegedly crossed the U.S. southern border illegally, and, according to a federal source familiar with the sting, no information was initially flagged with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) during processing.

(Alex Wong/Getty Images) The suspected terrorists were \"fully vetted\" and nothing was flagged, according to Fox News' federal source. The source said after the suspected terrorists were released into the U.S., information was flagged with national security concerns, including the individuals' ties to ISIS. Lechleiter said in the interview with NewsNation that \"sometimes there is just no information on individuals\" when they’re being vetted by Border Patrol. \"It is quite common where there is just nothing, you don't have anything. There's no criminal convictions, no threat information or whatever on these individuals.

Exactly what that network is up to is something that is, again, the subject of our current investigation.\" Former ICE chief of staff Jon Feere told Fox News Digital it is difficult to vet people coming into the U.S., even if they enter legally on a visa, and particularly if they enter illegally.

But when we're dealing with mass illegal immigration, as we're experiencing now, the odds of a bad actor coming through increase, and the threats that this administration has created will be felt for years to come.\" Feere, now at the Center for Immigration Studies, also faulted other agencies for admitting people into the U.S. and then expecting ICE to deal with the outcome. \"There's this expectation that, 'Well, we'll just let them in and hope that ICE cleans up any problems.' And then when something bad does happen and ICE doesn't locate them in time, it seems the finger-pointing is all too often at ICE,\" he said.  Fox News' Stepheny Price and Bill Melugin contributed to this report.

As many as 75% of people arrested in Midtown Manhattan in recent months for crimes such as assault, robbery and domestic violence have been migrants, police sources said in a report for the New York Post. According to the report, New York City courtrooms are packed with people who are in the city seeking asylum but have run afoul of the law, with police sources saying that lax bail guidelines mean migrants are quickly back on the streets of the city after being arrested. \"I would say about 75% of the arrests in Midtown Manhattan are migrants, mostly for robberies, assaults, domestic incidents and selling counterfeit items,\" a Midtown Manhattan police officer told the New York Post, noting that \"you can’t be 100% sure [they’re migrants] unless you arrest them in a shelter or they’re dumb enough to give you a shelter address.\" COLORADO MAYOR SPEAKS OUT AFTER VIDEO OF ARMED VENEZUELAN GANG IN APARTMENT GOES VIRAL: 'FAILED POLICY' Migrants reach for food being handed out while being recorded by a woman outside the Roosevelt Hotel, where dozens of recently arrived migrants have been camping out as they try to secure temporary housing on Aug. 2, 2023 in New York City. (Photo by Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images) The true scope of the problem is likely unknown, in large part because the police are not allowed to track the immigration status of people they detain. \"Police officers are prohibited from asking about the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or suspects and therefore the NYPD doesn’t track data pertaining to immigration statuses.,\" an NYPD spokesperson told Fox News Digital. The problem is not just limited to Manhattan, with police sources telling the New York Post that more than 60% of arrests in Queens have also been migrants. \"There are days we have so many migrant cases, we have to call in for extra Spanish interpreters,\" a law enforcement officer at the Queens Criminal Courthouse told the New York Post.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nMigrants are flooding the criminal justice system in New York City, making up over half of arrests in multiple areas of the city. In Midtown Manhattan, 75% of people arrested in recent months were migrants, mostly for crimes such as robbery, assault, and domestic violence. Police sources say lax bail guidelines mean migrants are quickly back on the streets after being arrested. The true scope of the problem is unknown because police are not allowed to track the immigration status of people they detain. In Queens, more than 60% of arrests have also been migrants, with police sources saying they often need extra Spanish interpreters. One migrant, Jefferson Maldenado, has been arrested five times since arriving in the US earlier this year. Police say New York City sanctuary city laws, which restrict police from working with ICE, have made the problem worse. New York City Mayor Eric Adams has called on the City Council to change the city's sanctuary laws, arguing that police need to be able to coordinate with ICE. Some police officers have become frustrated with the lack of progress, with one officer describing the area as resembling a \"Third World Country\". The issue has been exacerbated by the influx of migrants seeking asylum in the city."

        "text": "Sep 4, 2024 With illegal immigration in the news for almost four years, and a presidential election approaching, viewing this situation from an economic lens seems appropriate. According to Customs and Border Patrol Protection, encounters were 10,617,065 since Inauguration Day.  More than 10 million were admitted. This doesn’t include what CBPP calls “got aways” as they intentionally avoid an encounter. This number is unknown but is estimated to exceed 2 million.  The magnitudes are generally acknowledged as substantially larger than the 2016-20 period. How large is large and what difference does it make?  Consider that, according to Census Bureau data, the U.S. population was 331,449,281 at year-end 2020.  The U.S. population grew to an estimated 336,662,854 as of June 30. That represents a 1.6% increase over about four years or about 0.4% per year. This growth is smaller than historical comparisons and likely reflects an aging population and declining family size choices.  By subtraction, the population increase amounted to 5,213,730. How large is illegal immigration? It was roughly twice the natural population growth of the U.S. This influx clearly strains our infrastructure as evidenced by ubiquitous news reports.  The influx has significant demographic and economic consequences as well.  We generally know that illegal immigrants are at the lower end of the educational achievement scale and command relatively low wages.  If medical professionals, architects, engineers, schoolteachers and college faculty dominated the influx, we would have heard about it by now. This description is not intended to be derogatory, but simply to better describe the overwhelming majority of the illegal immigrants.  Eventually, most of these illegal immigrants will seek gainful employment. What impact should we expect from that assimilation?  To answer that question, we look to U.S. Census data. Poverty is roughly defined as the incomes of the lowest 20%. 20% of the current population amounts to 65,900,000 individuals. The influx of 10,000,000+ illegal aliens adds roughly 15% to the group — most competing for the same low-wage jobs.  This large increase in supply compares to the 1.6% increase in U.S. population. Since wages rarely fall, expect to see a large relative increase in unemployment among low-wage workers.  To the extent that illegal immigrants do not find gainful employment, they will add significantly to the programs designed to assist low-income wage earners.  The addition of 10 million illegal immigrants to this low wage group will increase competition for new jobs for some time into the future. As a result, wage growth of this wage group will lag what it otherwise would have been. Ironically, these expectations stand in stark contrast to the nation’s goals. As citizens, we expect an opportunity to achieve The American Dream. A major part of that dream is climbing the economic ladder.  Large illegal immigration holds down wages of the group we want to assist and further increases the cost of our entitlement programs.  To add further to the irony, about 34% of those in poverty are people of color and therefore are disproportionately disadvantaged by the influx.  Enough is enough.

A group of around 20 suspected illegal migrants attempted to board a school bus picking up elementary students in California on Wednesday, according to local reports, worrying parents.  The incident unfolded just 24 hours after a smaller group of suspected migrants tried to get on another school bus in the same district, according to local media citing education officials.  The two incidents took place within the Jamul-Dulzura Union School District in San Diego County, which is about 11 miles north of the southern border. The Wednesday incident saw a group of 20 migrants try to get on a bus picking up students along highway 94, FOX 5 reports, citing an emailed notice sent to student families from the district’s superintendent, Liz Bystedt.

(Frederic J. BROWN / AFP, left, and David Paul Morris/Bloomberg, right.) However, parents present at the stop helped the students get onto the bus safely and ensured no others boarded.  Nicole Cardinale, whose 8-year-old son was on the bus, said the encounter was \"really scary\" for the children.  \"[My son] said these adults, they weren’t kids, he said they had backpacks on Mom, and they were trying to get on our bus. He said there was a lot of them,\" she told the outlet. On Tuesday, a group composed of three suspected migrant males was walking in the middle of the highway and allegedly tried to stop another bus, prompting it to \"go around\" the group, according to Bystedt. It’s unclear if students were on the bus at the time.  No suspected migrants boarded either bus and no injuries were reported, according to the outlet. Bystedt wrote that while an investigation is being carried out, buses will drive past stops with migrants nearby and will instead head directly to the next one on the route \"for the safety of students and bus drivers.\" \"Please stay [vigilant] and if the bus drives by, please follow the bus to pick up your child at the next stop,\" she told families in the emailed notice.

Meanwhile, another parent, Jeremy Adams, called on the district to come up with a safety plan to quell fears.  \"We don’t know who these people are, we don’t know if they have any criminal history [or] what their background is,\" Adams told FOX 5.

Refugees succeed in America by working hard, finding niches and increasing their education and ability to speak English, according to new research. (MONICA M. DAVEY/AFP via Getty Images) Refugees succeed in America by working hard, finding niches and increasing their education and ability to speak English, according to new research. The study finds refugees experience rapid earnings growth and commit far fewer criminal offenses than the U.S.-born. Refugee admissions reached historic lows under the Trump administration but have increased under Joe Biden, including the most recent presidential determination. “Real earnings for refugees increased by 70% in the 10 years after arriving in the United States, showing refugees integrate and make economic progress in America,” according to a new National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) analysis. “The research finds refugees have low rates of incarceration and, over time, significantly increase their education level, use less welfare and improve their ability to speak English.” Mark Regets, an NFAP senior fellow and formerly an economist at the National Science Foundation, examined more than 30 years of data. He found refugees start with lower earnings but, on average, over the next 10 years, have far higher real earnings growth than other workers: 70% for refugees vs. 25% for the U.S.-born. (Real earnings are income adjusted for inflation.) He conducted the research by analyzing earnings growth and Census and immigration data on individuals aged 21 to 54 who entered America from countries with a high percentage of refugee admissions over five-year periods from 1985 through 2009. The president determines the annual ceiling for refugees, in consultation with Congress, and the U.S. Department of State administers the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. Despite the divisiveness on immigration today, the U.S. Senate passed the Refugee Act of 1980 in a unanimous vote. “Like other immigrants,” writes Regets, “refugees improve with time in the United States, particularly by investing in their skills and education, explaining why a dynamic analysis presents a more accurate picture of refugee integration than snapshots taken soon after refugees arrive.” Iraqis who came to America between 2005 and 2009 had real earnings growth of 127% over the next decade, compared to 25% for U.S.-born workers. Afghans who came to the United States between 1985 and 1989 after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan saw 98% growth in real earnings over the next 10-year period, compared to 35% for U.S.-born workers. Vietnamese who arrived in America between 1985 and 1989 experienced 89% real earnings growth over the next decade. “Refugees succeed in America because they add value to the U.S. economy and benefit Americans,” according to Regets. “Due to their rapid income growth, within a decade, refugees generally no longer have low incomes. Refugees show they adapt to the U.S. labor market and overcome the circumstances that drove them from their countries of birth. Refugees invest in U.S.-specific skills, find niches and make the U.S. economy more dynamic by 1) adapting to existing needs and 2) providing services that we didn’t know were desired or needed, such as by founding or working in new restaurants, nail salons and other businesses.” Refugees speak English or improve their ability to speak English and raise their educational level, according to the research. About 20% of refugees aged 21 to 54 attend school soon after arriving in America. More than 83% of refugees coming to the U.S. between 1985 and 2009 spoke English a year or more after arrival, which rose to 92% a decade later. Nearly half of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 spoke English well a year or more after arriving. That rose to 66% 10 years later, or 35% more. Refugees enter America at relatively high levels of education and improve with more time in the United States, according to the data. “In the year after arrival, 21.7% of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 had a bachelor’s degree or higher compared to 26.5% for the U.S.-born. Ten years later, 28.2% of refugees arriving between 1985 and 2009 had a bachelor’s degree, an increase of 30%.” Remarkably, the number of Ethiopians who came to America between 1985 and 1989 with a bachelor’s degree increased from 17% in 1990 to 45% by 2000, rising more than 150%. Seventy percent of refugees arriving in the United States between 1985 and 2009 had a high school degree or higher compared to 89% for the U.S.-born. After 10 years, 76% of refugees who arrived during this period earned a high school degree or higher, rising by 9%. Refugees appear to commit relatively few crimes. “Only 0.2% of refugees arriving in the United States between 1985 and 2009 were in jail or prison a year or more after entry vs. 1.3% for the U.S.-born,” according to Regets. “Incarceration rates remain low for refugees 10 years later.” The more time refugees spend in the United States, the less likely they are to use welfare. On average, after 10 years, refugee use of welfare declined by 63% for those arriving between 1985 and 2009 (9.4% in the year after arrival to 3.5% a decade later. Welfare use measures “receipt of any public assistance income,” which includes state and federal assistance. “The rapid earnings growth of refugees,” concludes Regets, “and their improving levels of education and ability to speak English show they integrate into American society, fill niches and expand the economy, rewarding the American people for welcoming them to a new land.”",

Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images A new study estimates that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, while often being shut out of the programs their taxes fund. In 40 states, undocumented immigrants paid higher tax rates than the top 1% of the income scale in those states, according to a study released Tuesday by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a left-leaning, nonprofit think tank. The study, which uses estimates of undocumented immigrants’ tax contributions as of 2022, shows those totaled $96.7 billion that year. In Maryland, they paid an estimated $779.3 million in total taxes that year, the ninth most among states, according to the report. Study authors also found that undocumented immigrants would contribute $40.2 billion more per year in federal, state and local taxes – an additional $262 million in Maryland – if all of the undocumented population had access to work authorization. The report’s authors reasoned that this boost would come from higher wages associated with employment authorization and easier compliance with income tax laws. The report also shed further light on the tax revenue provided by undocumented immigrants on the state and local level. Undocumented immigrants are paying 46% of their state and local tax payments through sales and excise taxes. Six states — New Jersey, New York, California, Florida, Texas, and Illinois — were able to raise more than $1 billion each in tax revenue from undocumented immigrants, the nonprofit said. Undocumented immigrants pay property taxes and sales taxes, and federal payroll taxes taken from their wages, as well as income tax returns using Individual Taxpayer Identification numbers. Those payroll taxes fund Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance, social programs that undocumented immigrants are not eligible to enroll in and receive regular benefits from. The bridge collapse is an immigration story  Immigrants can also face barriers to getting tax refunds, including getting scammed by unscrupulous tax preparers who target immigrant communities, said Jackie Vimo, senior analyst of economic justice policy at the National Immigration Law Center, in a media call on the report. The center focuses on racial, economic and social justice for low-income immigrants. “There are tons of laws that prevent undocumented workers from getting benefits,” said Richard C. Auxier, a principal policy associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that was not involved in the study. “They get a lot of political attention. At the end of the day, they’re just normal people paying normal taxes.” Alexis Tsoukalas, senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute, a nonprofit focused on economic mobility for Floridians, told reporters on Monday that she was struck by how much the state collected in taxes from undocumented immigrants compared to the wealthiest in the state. The current tax rate for undocumented immigrants in Florida is 8% compared to the top 1% of the state at 2.7%. “This means hundreds of thousands of everyday people are contributing more than their share to public services they cannot even access, meanwhile those with the most to give and the most to benefit contribute the least,” Tsoukalas said. The findings appear to counter anti-immigrant rhetoric that undocumented immigrants are “destroying” social programs. The study comes at a time when states are passing laws to arrest people they suspect of entering the U.S. illegally, a power long reserved for the federal government, and the Biden administration has taken executive action to allow for the deportation of many asylum seekers without processing their claims. The Republican Party platform this year promises the “largest deportation operation in American history” if former President Donald Trump is reelected, and tax policy will also be front and center for Congress and the White House next year as provisions of Trump’s tax law, passed in 2017, are set to expire. Aside from the human cost of deportations on families, policy experts and researchers are making the case that there is an economic cost as well, arguing that undocumented immigrants are a boon to the economy. Immigration and economic experts who spoke about the significance of the report on Monday highlighted the Congressional Budget Office’s July report on the rise in immigration and its effects on the economy and budget, which found that this increase in immigration would add $1.2 trillion in federal revenue from 2024 to 2034. Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there are economic ripple effects to consider in the deportation of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. beyond taxes. “If you deported someone and they’re no longer making taxable purchases in their community, that number would reflect a reduction in their sales tax payments to the community but it wouldn’t capture that second ripple effect of the business has less profits because they have fewer customers,” Davis said in a media call on the study. Auxier said that researchers have found that while children in an undocumented immigrant household receive education benefits that could be larger than the tax payments of their lower-income working parents, that is more of an income issue than a specific immigration issue. The other side of that coin, Auxier notes, is that in the future, undocumented households may in fact give back more than they received. “Those same studies tend to note that if the children go to school and they then go get jobs, now the American household is giving more than it got because the parents came here, worked, paid into Social Security, Medicare and didn’t get any benefits,” he said. “The kid went to school and then they got a job and then they started earning enough money that they were a net contributor.” Policy experts also pointed to a labor shortage — 8.1 million job openings and 6.8 million unemployed workers in June, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce — as a reason to embrace the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants. Maryland, South Dakota, North Dakota, Vermont, Maine, and South Carolina are some of the states facing the greatest labor shortages, according to a Washington Post analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. “Immigrants are already filling that [labor] gap and if we have mass deportations where millions of immigrants are torn from their family members and the country they have made home, we will not only have the human impact of this, but we’ll have a severe effect on the economy and available workforce,” said Vimo of the National Immigration Law Center. by Casey Quinlan, Maryland Matters August 2, 2024 by Casey Quinlan, Maryland Matters August 2, 2024 A new study estimates that undocumented immigrants paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state and local taxes in 2022, while often being shut out of the programs their taxes fund.

Auxier, a principal policy associate at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank that was not involved in the study. “They get a lot of political attention. At the end of the day, they’re just normal people paying normal taxes.” Alexis Tsoukalas, senior policy analyst at Florida Policy Institute, a nonprofit focused on economic mobility for Floridians, told reporters on Monday that she was struck by how much the state collected in taxes from undocumented immigrants compared to the wealthiest in the state. The current tax rate for undocumented immigrants in Florida is 8% compared to the top 1% of the state at 2.7%. “This means hundreds of thousands of everyday people are contributing more than their share to public services they cannot even access, meanwhile those with the most to give and the most to benefit contribute the least,” Tsoukalas said. The findings appear to counter anti-immigrant rhetoric that undocumented immigrants are “destroying” social programs. The study comes at a time when states are passing laws to arrest people they suspect of entering the U.S. illegally, a power long reserved for the federal government, and the Biden administration has taken executive action to allow for the deportation of many asylum seekers without processing their claims. The Republican Party platform this year promises the “largest deportation operation in American history” if former President Donald Trump is reelected, and tax policy will also be front and center for Congress and the White House next year as provisions of Trump’s tax law, passed in 2017, are set to expire. Aside from the human cost of deportations on families, policy experts and researchers are making the case that there is an economic cost as well, arguing that undocumented immigrants are a boon to the economy. Immigration and economic experts who spoke about the significance of the report on Monday highlighted the Congressional Budget Office’s July report on the rise in immigration and its effects on the economy and budget, which found that this increase in immigration would add $1.2 trillion in federal revenue from 2024 to 2034. Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there are economic ripple effects to consider in the deportation of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. beyond taxes. “If you deported someone and they’re no longer making taxable purchases in their community, that number would reflect a reduction in their sales tax payments to the community but it wouldn’t capture that second ripple effect of the business has less profits because they have fewer customers,” Davis said in a media call on the study. Auxier said that researchers have found that while children in an undocumented immigrant household receive education benefits that could be larger than the tax payments of their lower-income working parents, that is more of an income issue than a specific immigration issue. The other side of that coin, Auxier notes, is that in the future, undocumented households may in fact give back more than they received. “Those same studies tend to note that if the children go to school and they then go get jobs, now the American household is giving more than it got because the parents came here, worked, paid into Social Security, Medicare and didn’t get any benefits,” he said. “The kid went to school and then they got a job and then they started earning enough money that they were a net contributor.” Policy experts also pointed to a labor shortage — 8.1 million job openings and 6.8 million unemployed workers in June, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce — as a reason to embrace the economic contributions of undocumented immigrants. Maryland, South Dakota, North Dakota, Vermont, Maine, and South Carolina are some of the states facing the greatest labor shortages, according to a Washington Post analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. “Immigrants are already filling that [labor] gap and if we have mass deportations where millions of immigrants are torn from their family members and the country they have made home, we will not only have the human impact of this, but we’ll have a severe effect on the economy and available workforce,” said Vimo of the National Immigration Law Center.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nA new study found that undocumented immigrants in the US paid nearly $97 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022. This is despite being shut out of many programs their taxes fund. In 40 states, undocumented immigrants paid higher tax rates than the top 1% of the income scale. In Maryland, they paid an estimated $779.3 million in total taxes, the ninth most among states. If all undocumented immigrants had work authorization, they would contribute an additional $40.2 billion in taxes per year. Undocumented immigrants pay 46% of their state and local tax payments through sales and excise taxes. Six states raised over $1 billion each in tax revenue from undocumented immigrants. Undocumented immigrants also pay property taxes and federal payroll taxes, which fund programs like Medicare and Social Security, but they are not eligible to receive benefits from these programs. The study's findings counter anti-immigrant rhetoric that undocumented immigrants are a drain on the economy. In reality, they are a boon to the economy, and deporting them could have severe economic consequences."

        "text": "In an era of globalisation, few topics have sparked as much debate as immigration. Since the 2016 Brexit referendum, the United Kingdom has grappled with this issue, often framing it as a problem to be solved rather than an opportunity to be embraced. This article aims to shed light on the economic realities of immigration, dispelling common myths and highlighting the substantial benefits that immigrants bring to the UK economy, while also addressing the complex human aspects of this multifaceted issue. This is a worthwhile read, I promise you.Understanding the Human Face of ImmigrationBefore delving into the economic impacts, it's crucial to understand the human dimension of immigration.A. Push vs. Pull Factors in ImmigrationImmigration is often driven by a complex interplay of factors that either \"push\" people from their home countries or \"pull\" them towards new destinations.1. Push Factors: - War and conflict- Political persecution- Economic instability- Climate change and natural disasters- Lack of opportunities2. Pull Factors: - Economic opportunities- Political stability- Better education and healthcare systems- Family reunification- Freedom and human rights protectionsB. Current Conflicts Driving ImmigrationSeveral ongoing conflicts and crises are currently driving significant migration flows:1. Syrian Civil War2. Afghanistan: Taliban takeover in 20213. Ukraine-Russia Conflict: Russian invasion of Ukraine in 20224. Climate-induced DisplacementC. The Human PerspectiveBehind every statistic is a human story. Many immigrants, particularly refugees and asylum seekers, have faced unimaginable hardships. Consider: If you were faced with the choice between staying in a war-torn country where your family's safety was at risk, or embarking on a dangerous journey for the chance of a safer life, what would you do?II. Economic Contributions of ImmigrantsA. Impact on GDPImmigrants have consistently made positive contributions to the UK's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). According to a report by Oxford Economics, European immigrants alone contributed £2,300 more to UK public finances each year than the average adult resident.B. Labour Market ContributionsImmigrants play a crucial role in filling labour shortages across various sectors of the UK economy, often taking on jobs that are essential but less attractive to native-born workers.C. Entrepreneurship and InnovationImmigrants are not just employees; many are job creators and innovators. A study by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor found that immigrants in the UK are more likely to start businesses than native-born citizens.III. Sector-Specific BenefitsA. Industries Most Positively Impacted1. Healthcare: As of 2023, approximately 170,000 NHS staff in England reported a non-British nationality, making up about 14% of the workforce.2. Technology: According to Tech Nation, around 42% of UK tech startups have at least one foreign-born founder.3. Agriculture: Seasonal agricultural workers, many of whom are immigrants, are crucial for the UK's food security.B. Potential Growth Areas1. Green Energy: Immigrants with specialised skills in renewable energy technologies could play a pivotal role in the UK's transition to a low-carbon economy.2. Research and Development: Attracting top global talent could further boost the UK's position as a leader in scientific research and innovation.IV. Debunking Common MythsA. Job Displacement ConcernsContrary to popular belief, immigrants do not typically \"steal\" jobs from native workers. A study by the Migration Advisory Committee found that immigration has little impact on average wages of UK-born workers.B. Strain on Public ServicesWhile there is a common perception that immigrants overburden public services, research shows that they are net contributors to the UK economy. A report by the Office for Budget Responsibility suggests that higher net migration reduces pressure on government debt over time.C. Crime RatesData from the UK Home Office consistently shows that immigrants are no more likely to commit crimes than native-born citizens. In fact, areas with high immigration often see decreases in crime rates.V. Case StudiesA. Successful Immigrant Entrepreneurs1. Elon Musk: Born in South Africa, lived as an undocumented immigrant in Canada before moving to the US. Now holds citizenship in South Africa, Canada, and the US.2. Dame Manju Shahul-Hameed: The first Asian woman to become Mayor of Croydon, a successful businesswoman who has made significant contributions to both the business world and public service in the UK.B. Immigrant Contributions in Key SectorsDr. Maggie Aderin-Pocock: A British-Nigerian space scientist and science educator who has made significant contributions to UK space exploration and science communication.VI. Global PerspectiveA. Comparison with US and European DataThe positive impact of immigration on economic growth is not unique to the UK. In the United States and Germany, studies have found immigrants to be net contributors to public finances.B. Economic Outcomes in Countries with Pro-Immigration PoliciesCanada, known for its points-based immigration system, has seen consistent economic growth partly attributed to its welcoming stance on immigration.VII. The Path to CitizenshipA. Current Pathways in the UKThe UK offers several routes to citizenship, including naturalisation after residing in the country for a specified period, marriage to a British citizen, and the EU Settlement Scheme for EU citizens who were residing in the UK before Brexit.B. Economic Benefits of NaturalizationResearch suggests that naturalised citizens often see improvements in their economic situations, with higher employment rates and earnings compared to non-naturalized immigrants.VIII. The Role of Media and Public PerceptionA. Impact of Conservative Media NarrativesConservative media outlets have often portrayed immigration in a negative light, potentially influencing public opinion and policy. This has contributed to a rise in anti-immigrant sentiment over the past decade.B. Addressing the Rise of Anti-Immigrant SentimentIt's crucial to counter these narratives with factual information about the economic benefits of immigration and the human stories behind the statistics.IX. Housing and Support for Asylum SeekersA. Government Support for Asylum Seekers1. Scale and Cost: - As of March 2020, approximately 48,000 asylum seekers were under new accommodation contracts in the UK.- The cost of housing asylum seekers in hotels was estimated at £5.6 million per day in February 2023, according to Home Office figures.2. Types of Accommodation:- Contrary to some claims, most asylum seekers are not housed in luxury hotels.- While hotels are sometimes used as initial accommodation, hostel-type facilities are more common.- The government is exploring alternatives like the Bibby Stockholm barge to reduce costs.B. Debunking Common Myths1. \"48,000 illegal immigrants in luxury hotels\": This claim is false. According to Reuters fact-checking, only about 1,000 asylum seekers were housed in hotels each night as of March 2020.2. Comparison with Veteran Homelessness: Claims about large numbers of homeless veterans compared to housed asylum seekers are often unsubstantiated.C. Economic and Ethical ConsiderationsWhile the costs of supporting asylum seekers are substantial, they should be viewed in the context of the UK's overall budget and its humanitarian commitments.X. Voices of SupportA. Quotes from Prominent Investors and Business LeadersWarren Buffett: \"Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers.\"Sir Richard Branson: \"For Britain to be successful, it must take a leading role in this competitive world – and for that we need an open economy that gives all, including migrants, an opportunity to contribute.\"B. Economic Expert OpinionsProfessor Jonathan Portes, King's College London: \"The economic impacts of immigration to the UK have been mostly positive, and there is no reason to fear moderate increases in immigration in the future.\"The evidence is clear: immigration has been and continues to be a net positive for the UK economy. From filling crucial labour shortages to driving innovation and entrepreneurship, immigrants contribute significantly to economic growth and diversity. While concerns about immigration are understandable, they are often based on misconceptions rather than economic realities.As the UK navigates its post-Brexit future, it's crucial to embrace evidence-based policy-making regarding immigration. By welcoming diverse talent and fostering an inclusive environment, the UK can enhance its economic resilience and maintain its position as a global leader in innovation and growth.The path forward should involve a balanced approach that recognizes the economic benefits of immigration while addressing legitimate concerns through thoughtful policy. By doing so, the UK can harness the full potential of immigration to drive prosperity for all its residents, both native-born and immigrant alike, while fulfilling its humanitarian obligations on the global stage.Want to know more?https://migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/resources/briefings/the-fiscal-impact-of-immigration-in-the-uk/References:1.

Logan Our people Transparency Speeches Connect with us July 02, 2024 The current U.S. immigration surge is unprecedented. The influx flew under the radar for some time, dismissed simply as pent-up immigration from when the borders essentially closed during the pandemic. But this year’s Congressional Budget Office (CBO) budget and economic outlook brought new attention to the migrant inflow and its expected economic effects. By incorporating previously unavailable data on migration along the southwest border into the government’s economic and fiscal outlook, the macroeconomic implications of such high levels of migration come into focus. The labor force in 2033  will be larger by 5.2 million people, mostly because of higher net immigration, according to CBO estimates. As a result of the immigration surge, GDP will be higher by about $8.9  trillion and federal government tax revenues by $1.2 trillion over the 2024-34  period. Deficits will be lower by $900 billion. Government estimates of net immigration differ wildly. Census 2023 estimates (July to July) put net immigration at 1.1 million, far from CBO’s calendar-year 2023 estimate of 3.3 million (Chart 1). CBO similarly estimated a much higher net immigration number than other agencies in 2022—2.7 million. Net immigration is the sum of individuals who enter the country minus those who leave. Entries can be permanent or temporary but exclude short-term visitors such as tourists. Entries can also be legal, when people come with U.S. government visas, or otherwise, such as humanitarian migrants (asylum seekers and, more recently, humanitarian parolees) and unauthorized immigrants.  CBO included real-time data on the number of border crossers allowed into the country, statistics that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) recently made available. Recently released 2023 data on immigrant work permits cast doubt on the lower immigration estimates in Chart 1 and are broadly supportive of CBO’s higher numbers. In 2023 alone, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel encountered 2.54 million migrants at the southwest border (Chart 2). This is about the same as the 2.58 million migrants in 2022, a record year. This compares with the prepandemic annual average of 500,000 migrants. Since the pandemic began in the U.S. in February 2020, CBP has recorded almost 8 million encounters at the southwest border, along with almost 2 million encounters at the northern border, coastal border and airports. “Encounters,” previously known as apprehensions, include all people at and between ports of entry who are either stopped by the Border Patrol or who turn themselves in. In recent years, an increasing share of migrants simply approaches the Border Patrol and states an intention to seek asylum. During the pandemic and until May 2023, some of these migrants, typically single adults, were immediately expelled under a provision known as Title 42, used to deny migrants entrance because of public health concerns related to COVID. However, more consideration was given to families and unaccompanied minors, and so even before the end of Title 42, the volume of migrants far exceeded available detention space. As a result, the majority of migrants has been paroled or otherwise released into the country to pursue asylum claims or other immigration pathways. Notably, Border Patrol encounters do not include got-aways, or unauthorized immigrants, who escape the notice of Border Patrol while crossing or who are seen but not stopped. DHS publishes estimates of such migrants, although the figures differ significantly from estimates by demographers, at least in recent years. Though the number of encounters does not necessarily translate directly to the number of migrants admitted into the U.S., a smaller share is getting turned away than previously. In 2023, fewer than a quarter of encounters at the southwest U.S. border ended in migrants being refused entry into the U.S., and 58 percent of encounters resulted in migrants released or paroled into the interior (Chart 3). This is a reversal from the previous nine years, when more than half of the 8.7 million migrants apprehended at the southern border were not admitted to the U.S., and less than a quarter were allowed in. Harsh and deteriorating conditions in many Latin American and Caribbean nations, including Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, prompted the U.S. government to expand programs such as humanitarian parole for those nations’ natives. Many migrants risk the trip to not only escape difficult circumstances, but also on the belief they can enter the United States under humanitarian provisions. Another pull factor is the availability of work and rising wages. The postpandemic U.S. labor market was extremely tight, especially in sectors that tend to rely on immigrant labor. The job openings rate, or the number of job vacancies as a share of total employment in a sector, reached record highs in 2021 and 2022 for accommodation and food services, retail trade and health care and social assistance, among others. Wages also rose faster in immigrant-intensive occupations and industries than in those that had a lower share of immigrants (Chart 4). Studies have shown that U.S. labor market conditions are among the main drivers of unauthorized immigration. With this recent immigration wave, the foreign-born labor force has recovered completely from the pandemic drop, even exceeding what would have been expected absent the pandemic (Chart 5). The foreign-born labor force reached February 2020 levels in November 2021, and surpassed trend growth in August 2022, according to the Current Population Survey. If the foreign-born labor force had grown at the 2000–19 trend rate of 2.2 percent per year starting in January 2020, it would have been smaller by almost 900,000 people in April 2024. The jump in ready-to-work immigrants has boosted population, labor force and job growth in the postpandemic U.S. economy. Estimates from the Hamilton Project suggest higher immigration boosted payroll job growth by 70,000 jobs per month in 2022 and by 100,000 jobs per month in 2023 and so far in 2024. The upper end of the range of job growth has doubled to 200,000 from 100,000 jobs per month absent the surge of immigration. It’s not unusual for immigration to account for high shares of job growth. Before the pandemic, from 2010 to 2019, the share of job growth attributable to immigration averaged 45 percent. The jump in jobs, along with immigrants’ consumption of goods and services in the United States, also bolsters GDP growth. According to the Hamilton Project study, higher immigration has contributed about 0.1 percentage points to GDP growth annually in 2022 and 2023 and is projected to do so again in 2024. The effect on inflation, meanwhile, could be neutral on average. Higher immigration represents a labor supply shock, which should be disinflationary. But immigrants are also consumers and add to aggregate demand. While certain sectors that extensively depend on immigrants should see costs and prices fall—for example, landscaping and child care—the population influx could put upward pressure on rents and house prices, particularly in the short run before new supply can be built. The immigration surge has surprised many, and not everyone agrees with the CBO numbers. But household survey data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) are consistent with CBO estimates of immigration in 2023. According to the CPS, the foreign-born population rose by 2.5 million from December 2022 to December 2023, even as we estimate about 500,000 immigrants died. These data points are consistent with a net immigrant inflow of at least 3 million over the year. The doubts about CBO’s large number involve problems with encounter data (it measures events, not individuals), debates about migrant return rates and criticism of the household survey (whether it overcounts or undercounts immigrants). CBO’s immigration projections are even more uncertain, with expected net immigration of 3.3 million in 2024, 2.6 million in 2025, 1.6 million in 2026 and a return to the historical average 1.1 million in 2027–33. It’s unclear what factors drive these transitions. Potential changes in U.S. immigration policy, such as the Biden administration’s recent executive action limiting the entry of some migrants, or an economic downturn could result in gradual normalization of immigration at the border. Even so, many of the migrants who arrived in recent years will want to stay in the United States. Asylum approval rates have risen since 2020 but reflect cases filed in years prior. It’s impossible to know what approval rates will be for those who filed their claims more recently. Humanitarian parolees, in contrast, are supposed to return to their home countries after two years. If immigration normalizes, it will return to rates that are insufficient to sustain the type of economic growth the U.S. is accustomed to. The nation is in a sort of demographic autumn, and winter is coming. The retirement of the baby boomers and overall aging of the workforce, as well as low and falling birth rates mean population growth will become entirely dependent on immigration by 2040, as deaths of U.S.-born will outpace births (Chart 6). Because economic growth depends on labor, capital and productivity, growth in these factors will set the speed limit of the economy. While technological advances and incentives for investment will contribute to productivity growth, immigration will be vital to propping up labor force growth. About the authors \nPia M.

Suscribe x MercoPress, en Español Montevideo, October 21st 2024  - 09:41 UTC     Long delays at the U.S.-Mexico border crossing for goods destined for American plants and consumers are hitting the U.S. auto industry, and the gridlock reduced by half the number of northbound trucks that crossed the entry point last week. Washington’s decision to move some 750 agents from commercial to immigration duties to handle a surge in families seeking asylum in the United States has triggered the delays at crucial ports on a border that handle US$ 1.7 billion in daily trade.  “The situation in Ciudad Juarez is very serious because these auto parts go to plants in the United States and obviously they put at risk the operation in the United States,” Eduardo Solis, the president of the Mexican Auto Industry Association (AMIA), said on Monday. The North American auto industry is highly integrated and many car parts cross the border several times before they are finally installed on a vehicle.  Seventeen 17 hours before the crossing to El Paso even opened on Monday morning, trucks were already lining up in Ciudad Juarez to avoid the fate of some 7,500 trailers that failed to cross last week, said Manuel Sotelo, vice president at the Mexican National Chamber of Freight Transport’s north division.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nLong delays at the US-Mexico border are affecting the US auto industry, with the number of northbound trucks crossing the border reduced by half last week. The delays are caused by Washington's decision to move 750 agents from commercial to immigration duties to handle a surge in families seeking asylum. The Mexican Auto Industry Association says the situation is \"very serious\" because auto parts are not reaching US plants. The North American auto industry is highly integrated, with many car parts crossing the border multiple times before being installed on a vehicle. Trucks are lining up 17 hours before the border crossing opens to avoid delays, with 7,500 trailers failing to cross last week. This is roughly half the number of trucks that usually cross the border, carrying goods such as car parts, refrigerators, and electronics. Some Mexican exporters are turning to air freight to avoid the mile-long lines at the border, despite the elevated costs. The use of charter planes costs between $35,000 and $100,000 depending on the volume and merchandise. The delays are causing problems for the auto industry, which relies on the timely delivery of parts. The situation is unprecedented, with some calling it a crisis."

        "text": "Immigration isn't taking jobs away from Americans — and it's actually great for the US economy, according to Nobel laureate Paul Krugman. In an op-ed for The New York Times, the top economist pointed to economic arguments against immigration, with former President Trump claiming that immigrants have been taking job gains away from native-born Americans in recent years. However, Krugman said the data don't support that argument, as the unemployment rate for US-born workers has remained near a historical low of 4.3%, according to Federal Reserve data. The labor force participation rate among native-born workers has been on the decline, but among prime-age native-born workers, the labor force participation rate has actually been rising, Fed data shows. That's a solid sign that the stagnation among US workers is largely because of the wave of boomers retiring, Krugman said. \"So the near stagnation of native-born employment isn't a demand-side issue, in which people aren't working because they can't find jobs. It is instead a supply-side issue, in which people aren't working because they've reached retirement age. We've been able to achieve large increases in overall employment only because working-age immigrants have been coming to America. If we didn't have the immigrants, we wouldn't have the jobs,\" Krugman wrote. There's also evidence that immigration has helped push wages up, as immigrants do not ultimately compete with US workers for the same jobs. Wages among all workers have shot up 25% since 2020, around the time the employment of foreign-born workers in the US began rising. Immigration could also be helping the Fed keep a lid on inflation, Krugman said. \"Immigrants expand supply, but they also contribute to demand. In the aftermath of the pandemic, however, the huge sums spent on aid pumped up demand; this burst of demand was easier to accommodate without sustained inflation because immigration made it possible to achieve rapid growth in employment,\" he added. Other economists and strategists on Wall Street have said immigration could end up being a big boost to the economy. Rising immigration could help the US grow another $7 trillion over the next 10 years, according to a recent projection from the Congressional Budget Office. \"So, no, immigrants aren't taking our jobs. Everything that happens in the economy hurts someone: There are no doubt some places where immigrants have driven up housing costs, or where native-born Americans or legal immigrants have faced increased job competition. But the scare stories don't match the facts,\" Krugman said. Jump to",
        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nNobel laureate Paul Krugman argues that immigration is not taking jobs away from Americans and is actually beneficial to the US economy. Despite claims by former President Trump, data shows that the unemployment rate for US-born workers has remained near a historical low. The labor force participation rate among native-born workers has been declining, but this is largely due to baby boomers retiring. In contrast, the labor force participation rate among prime-age native-born workers has been rising. Krugman attributes the growth in overall employment to working-age immigrants coming to America. He also notes that immigration has helped push wages up, as immigrants do not compete with US workers for the same jobs. Wages among all workers have increased by 25% since 2020, coinciding with the rise in employment of foreign-born workers. Immigration has also helped the Fed keep inflation in check by expanding supply and contributing to demand. According to a Congressional Budget Office projection, rising immigration could help the US grow another $7 trillion over the next 10 years. Krugman concludes that immigrants are not taking jobs away from Americans and that the benefits of immigration far outweigh any potential drawbacks."

Doing so – as all of our neighboring states have already done – or permitting the City of Philadelphia to do so at the local level will help to alleviate poverty in Pennsylvania and ensure that every worker receives a fair, family-sustaining wage. Nobody reading these words needs to be reminded that Philadelphia, with a poverty rate that remains above 20%, has consistently been called “the poorest big city in America” – a label that has stuck despite steady economic improvements over the last decade. As countless reports have shown, our city’s economic gains over the past 15 years have not been evenly shared across all neighborhoods and communities, leading to what many call “a tale of two cities.” Recently published data reveals that while roughly 1 in 8 white households in Philadelphia experience poverty, 1 in 4 African American households are living below the poverty line. Meanwhile, 33% of Hispanic households in Philadelphia have incomes below the poverty level – the highest of any ethnic group. While white, Asian and Hispanic households have seen median household income rise by more than 20% since 2010, African American families’ median income increased by just 5.7% over the same period. Related articles Opinion: PA has a cost of living crisis. Let local leaders help. As PA sees record number of SNAP recipients, advocates call for a minimum wage increase How raising the minimum wage would help some and hurt others Even a cursory review of the math shows that Pennsylvania’s minimum wage is wholly inadequate for supporting the needs of working Pennsylvanians and their families. According to the Living Wage Calculator, a tool created by MIT professor Amy K. Glassmeier to calculate the wage necessary in different states to pay for basic necessities, the breadwinner in a two-parent, two-child household must earn more than five times the current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour to make ends meet. In higher-cost localities like Philadelphia, a minimum-wage paycheck would be stretched even further. In fact, Philadelphia was found to have the fourth-lowest “real minimum wage” of all American cities, according to a recent SmartAsset study, meaning that our city is among the most difficult places in the country for minimum-wage workers to afford basic necessities. Nobody working a full-time job should have to struggle to make ends meet and raising Pennsylvania’s outdated minimum wage is a matter of basic fairness for working families in our commonwealth.  Increasing the wage to at least $15 per hour – a figure already reached in New York and New Jersey, and which will be reached in Maryland and Delaware by 2025 – and tying automatic increases to the rate of inflation will help ensure that hard-working Pennsylvanians can earn enough to support themselves and their families. While many opponents will point to anticipated job losses and business closures in the event that employers are required to raise wages, other cities’ and states’ experiences after increasing the minimum wage have shown that these fears are not founded in the data. Gov. Josh Shapiro has again proposed a minimum wage increase as a part of his budget address to the General Assembly and it is incumbent upon our elected leaders in Harrisburg to take up this proposal and ensure that every Pennsylvanian, regardless of their ZIP code or background, has access to family-sustaining employment and meaningful economic opportunity.

The Examiner revealed details of a leaked report which showed that plans to increase the minimum wage to £13.73 in April 2025 could cost private and third sector businesses up to £188m in the first year alone. Now the island’s Chamber of Commerce has responded to the findings of the report that was commissioned by the minimum wage committee. It noted that the report highlighted some potential benefits, but also reflected business community concerns about potential negative impacts. While businesses support moves to help lower paid employees, said Chamber, the proposed increase will have an impact that is not in the island’s long-term economic interests and could lead to more redundancies and business closures. It pointed out many employers are already under extreme financial pressure and need more time to phase in the changes. The chamber is urging government to reconsider the April 2025 deadline and look at what support could be provided to help businesses offset some of increased costs.  Its chief executive officer Rebecca George said: ‘Chamber appreciates the good motives behind Tynwald and government’s commitment to transition to the minimum wage by April 2025, but there are still widespread concerns in the business community. ‘Chamber, acting on behalf of the business community, has major concerns regarding the proposed timeline and its potential economic ramifications. ‘Increasing the minimum wage hourly rate to £13.73 in April 2025 would represent an increase of 28% when compared to the 2023 rate of £10.75. ‘The proposed increase is approximately 14 times greater than the current inflation rate which is around 2%. ‘The living wage increases are also above the inflation rate, and the combined effects of these disparities will make Isle of Man businesses less competitive. ‘But businesses are also concerned about the speed at which the new minimum wage rate is being introduced and the difficulties it creates in terms of employers maintaining financial sustainability.’ The report, which was conducted by Pragmatix Advisory, found that the impact of any wage increase for lower paid workers would be diluted by increases in tax and National Insurance. It’s important to note, said Chamber, that while the island’s minimum wage has risen by around 38% since 2018, personal allowances have risen by only 9% over the same period.  Increasing the minimum wage by 28% could have several significant impacts especially on the retail, hospitality and care sectors, the report finds. The Chamber said there are many concerns within the business community, with the three most important being economic disruption and job losses, inflationary pressures and price increases and the need for gradual implementation. Overall, said Chamber, while higher minimum wages can improve living standards for workers, the impacts on a number of sectors in the Manx economy are likely to vary depending upon individual business models, market conditions, and consumer responses. In a joint statement, the Department for Enterprise and Treasury said they had to balance the needs of employers and employees and take into account the broader economic context. They said it was up to the minimum wage committee to review the report's findings, along with other inputs from their consultation process, to make a ‘well-rounded’ recommendation - to enable the departments to lay a proposal before Tynwald in October. ‘Given the report’s limitations due to its sample size, it is expected to be considered as one element in a broader assessment,’ they added. ‘Ultimately any adjustments to the island’s minimum wage rates will be subject to Tynwald consideration and approval.'

Every session of the California Legislature seems to produce at least one bill that generates high-octane political debate and media attention. As the 2023-24 session winds down this week, Senate Bill 1047, which would impose rules on artificial intelligence developers, is generating fierce lobbying and drawing global interest. During the final days of last year’s session, the focus was on a very different issue — whether the state should impose a $20-per-hour minimum wage for fast food workers and create a Fast Food Council to oversee working conditions. A year before, Assembly Bill 257 created the council and empowered it to set an initial minimum wage of at least $22 an hour, while assuming that franchised fast food outlets were subsidiaries of the parent company, rather than independently owned. The fast food industry responded with a referendum that, if ratified by voters, would cancel out the new law, thus renewing the debate in the 2023 session. A last-minute deal repealed AB 257 and substituted another measure, AB 1228, that dictated a $20 minimum wage and removed what the industry considered to be a threat to the franchise system. In return, the referendum was dropped. The $20 wage took effect last April, but only after a new squabble erupted over which sellers of food would be covered, colored by a Bloomberg article alleging that Newsom had demanded an exemption to benefit a campaign donor who owns two dozen Panera locations in California. Newsom declared that the story was “absurd” and gave assurances that Panera and other similar businesses would be covered. The businessman, billionaire Greg Flynn, also said he would honor the $20 wage. End of fast food angst? Of course not. Six months after the $20 wage took effect there’s a new debate in political, media and academic circles over its impact. Fast food prices have been increasing, but how much higher wages are driving the rise and how fast food operations have changed are two new issues. This month, Newsom declared that California fast food outlets had created 11,000 new jobs since the law was signed. “What’s good for workers is good for business, and as California’s fast food industry continues booming every single month our workers are finally getting the pay they deserve,” Newsom said. “Despite those who pedaled lies about how this would doom the industry, California’s economy and workers are again proving them wrong.” The industry didn’t agree.  “Every day you see headlines of restaurant closures, employee job losses and hours cut, and rising food prices for consumers,” the International Franchise Association said in a statement. “Local restaurant owners in California are already struggling to cope with the $20/hour wage, as the Fast Food Council considers additional wage increases. All the while, workers and consumers are feeling the pinch.” Brooke Armour, president of the California Center for Jobs and the Economy, an adjunct of the Business Roundtable, criticized Newsom’s declaration as reflecting just one month of preliminary data and concluding, “Despite what some are saying, the data are clear: newly passed fast food minimum wage laws are leading to job losses in California.” Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, also was critical in an analysis of the state’s economic trends. “California’s well-intended push to reduce income inequality via wage floors is beginning to have a significant negative impact on some of our most vulnerable workers — our youth, particularly those from lower income households,” Thornberg wrote. What California has wrought in the fast food industry could be the harbinger of more direct regulation of other industries, and not just in California, for better or worse. It’s not surprising, therefore, that its effects will be debated ad nauseam. Read more from CalMatters Text Get breaking news on your phone.

The effects of the law will likely be debated extensively, and could have implications for the regulation of other industries. The outcome could be a harbinger of more direct regulation, for better or worse."

        "text": "Monday October 21, 2024  As we mark International Equal Pay Day, it is essential to reflect on the state of labour markets, particularly for women and youth, in Bangladesh. The vision of our younger generation is defined by a strong commitment to equality, fairness, and opportunities for decent work.  However, the harsh reality is that the employment creation in Bangladesh has not kept pace with these expectations, leaving many young people, especially women, unemployed or trapped in low-paying jobs, facing wage unpredictability, and battling systemic barriers that hinder upward mobility. The disconnect between education and employment opportunities has resulted in frustration and disillusionment for many. Almost two million youth enter the labour force each year, yet many struggle to find jobs that match their qualifications, while those who do secure employment often start with salaries that are far below a liveable wage. There is a stark wage gap, and in sectors like agriculture, where women are heavily represented, women earn 31.51% less than men for the same work.  On the demand side, employers often lament the lack of real workplace-relevant skills at all levels, pinpointing the need for reforms in education and training on market-relevant skills, including social skills, and through workplace learning like apprenticeship and traineeship programmes.  One of the most pressing challenges is the unpredictability of wages. The wage-setting system in Bangladesh is often arbitrary and lacks transparency and fairness. Young workers, especially in the informal sector—which accounts for around 85% of total employment—are the most susceptible to unfair practices. The issue of low wages is often compounded with the lack of wage security, benefits, and the potential for career progression. This is a significant concern, as it leaves young people trapped in precarious employment conditions with little hope for wage growth or financial stability. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the national minimum wage increases have not kept up with inflation or living costs. According to the ILO's Global Wage Report, Bangladesh has seen one of the steepest declines in real wages among Asia-Pacific countries, with an annual decline rate of 5.9%. This means that while nominal wages may have risen, the purchasing power of those wages has diminished, leaving many workers, especially young people, worse off. A call for an evidence-based wage setting system There is a need for a comprehensive, evidence-based national wage-setting system. Such a system would provide predictability, fairness, and transparency in wage determination, ensuring that workers are paid according to the value of their labour and that wage adjustments reflect economic realities like inflation and cost of living.  Establishing a wage-setting mechanism could also help bridge the gender wage gap and ensure that marginalised groups—such as women, people with disabilities, and minority communities—receive fair wages for their work. A national wage-setting system grounded in evidence could also play a vital role in poverty reduction. Bangladesh has made significant strides in setting minimum wages in the readymade garment sector, but it is time to extend this to other industries.  A gender-inclusive wage policy, guided by the principles of International Labour Standards such as ILO Convention No 100 on Equal Remuneration, would be a powerful step toward ensuring that all workers, regardless of gender or background, are compensated fairly for their labour. Promoting wage transparency is another crucial step, as it would help unearth wage disparities and hold employers accountable for closing pay gaps. Other compounded systemic barriers to youth employment In addition to wage-setting issues, there are other systemic barriers that prevent young people in Bangladesh from meaningful participation in the labour market. These equally deserve our attention and include the mismatch between market demand and supply in terms of skills and competencies, poor quality of education and skills training systems and absence of critical employment support functions, like career counselling. In addition, the informality of employment and the absence of social security provisions for the workers are additional structural and governance challenges that young people face, making them more susceptible to working poverty. Young women, overseas workers and marginalised communities are particularly vulnerable to all these challenges, while also facing additional barriers, both structural and cultural. The role of youth in driving change Despite the significant challenges youth face in Bangladesh's labour market, they are uniquely positioned to drive meaningful reform. With their energy and passion for justice, young people are already pushing for greater transparency, fair wage-setting mechanisms, and gender equity. Youth-led organisations are playing a key role in raising awareness about wage disparities and advocating for more inclusive labour market policies. Engaging youth in creating robust labour market institutions and involving them in policy dialogues is essential for building a fairer, more transparent workforce. Supporting youth participation in trade unions and employers' organisations would also amplify their voices in critical discussions about labour rights and wages. On this International Equal Pay Day, let us therefore reaffirm our commitment to creating a labour market that serves all—especially youth, who represent the future of Bangladesh. By addressing wage disparities and promoting transparency, we can build a prosperous and just Bangladesh where every young person can thrive. From ILO's side, we remain committed to supporting these efforts in collaboration with the interim government, workers, and employers' organisations.  Tuomo Poutiainen is the Country Director of ILO in Bangladesh.

A new survey from the Institute of Directors (IoD) found that a majority (57 per cent) of business leaders will be less likely to hire as a result of the government’s workers’ rights package. Some 36 per cent said the reforms would have no impact on firms’ hiring intentions while just two per cent said it would make them more likely to hire. The survey makes apparent the extent of business concern over the new deal for workers, which is one of the most controversial aspects of Labour’s legislative agenda. The package, which the government claims is “unashamedly pro-worker and pro-business”, includes a ban on “exploitative” zero hours contracts and will give workers day-one employment rights. Ministers will put an employment rights bill before Parliament in October, but it is not yet clear which specific measures will be included in the bill. Alexandra Hall-Chen, principal policy advisor for employment at the IoD, said business leaders were concerned about the costs that might be imposed by the new reforms. “It is essential that the government starts to meaningfully engage with business on the detail of its proposed reforms to ensure that its growth mission is not derailed,” she added. The IoD’s survey comes after the Low Pay Commission (LPC) said that it expects to increase the national living wage to £12.10 from April next year, an increase of 5.8 per cent on its current level. The figure reflects the updated remit that the LPC has been asked to consider, which requires that the living wage does not drop below two-thirds of average earnings. The government has also asked the LPC to take account of the cost of living. The LPC noted that there was substantial uncertainty over the figure, suggesting it could come anywhere in a range of £11.82-£12.39. Nevertheless, the size of the increase sparked some concern among business groups, particularly after the near 11 per cent increase that took place this April.  “With the National Living Wage set to rise, it’s vital that small firms have the support they need to reduce the pressure that higher wage costs will put on their finances,” Tina McKenzie, policy chair at the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) said. According to research from the FSB, 64 per cent of small firms adopted more risk-averse recruitment practices after April’s increase in the minimum wage.  Hall-Chen at the IoD said that the combined impact of the workers rights’ package and a higher minimum wage would be “considerable disincentives” for employers to hire.  It comes as a survey revealed small businesses are more unprepared than bigger firms for the government’s slated reforms to workers’ rights, such as banning zero-hours contracts. One in six – or 17 per cent – of small businesses, with under 249 workers, said they are ‘not aware’ of the new employment rights legislation Labour is preparing to bring in, while this figure dropped to 14 per cent for all UK firms, according to Savanta’s business tracker. Some six in ten – or 62 per cent – of companies said they were prepared for implementation of the new legislation if it passes through Parliament as expected, the survey found. Matt McGinn, from Savanta said: “Labour’s ambitious workers’ rights and employment proposals have become a bit of a lightning rod for criticism since the election. “In particular our research would suggest smaller businesses are the least prepared for the changes, and are much more likely to say the potential reforms will be difficult to implement.” A spokesperson for the Department of Business and Trade said: “We are changing the rules to put more money in working people’s pockets. But we have also been clear we need to consider the businesses who pay these wages, employment prospects and the impact on the wider economy.” They added: “We continue to work closely with businesses and will ensure employers can operate fair and transparent probation periods so they can hire with confidence. “The majority of employers support the government’s proposals to strengthen employment rights, with a recent survey of bosses showing they think it would be positive for productivity, staff retention and profits.” \n\t\t\t\tShare this article\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\tSubscribe to the City AM newsletter to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tFollow us for breaking news and latest updates\t\t\t \n\t\tSubscribe to get the essential daily news updates from City AM's top stories to your inbox.\t",
        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nBusiness groups are concerned about the potential impact of Labour's workers' rights package and a likely 6% increase in the minimum wage next year. A survey by the Institute of Directors found that 57% of business leaders will be less likely to hire due to the government's workers' rights package. Only 2% said the reforms would make them more likely to hire. The package includes a ban on zero-hours contracts and day-one employment rights. The government claims the package is \"unashamedly pro-worker and pro-business\". Business leaders are concerned about the costs imposed by the new reforms. The Low Pay Commission expects to increase the national living wage to £12.10 from April next year.

Germany's Federal Minister of Labor Hubertus Heil said on Monday that a significant increase of the national minimum wage is necessary to keep up with the rising cost of living. A member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's ruling Social Democrats (SPD), Heil said that without this increase, Germany risked violating an EU directive. Heil said in a television interview on German public broadcaster ARD that the move was about \"having a reliable minimum wage so that people can make a living from their work.\" \"Six million people will benefit from this\" immediately, he said, adding that by \"2026, the minimum wage will be between 14 and 15 euros.\"  Germany's current federal minimum wage is €12.41 ($13.70) per hour. Heil's comments came as he prepared to report to the Minimum Wage Commission, which he was obligated to do by November. The move will also bring Germany in line with EU regulations about how high the minimum wage must be in relation to medium income, he said. Yasmin Fahimi, head of the German Trade Union Confederation, welcomed Heil's statements, saying \"Germany needs a poverty-proof miminum wage.\" However, the Free Democrats (FDP), a pro-business party that rules in coalition with the center-left SPD and the environmentalist Greens, criticized the announcement. They accused Heil of trying to win political points and said it would \"weaken Germany as a business destination\" and hurt the competitiveness of small businesses. They further argued that Germany already met the EU requirements. While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

        "text": "by Luzmila Freese Barely two months ago, Seattle gig workers began earning minimum wage for the first time. Here at the Latino Community Fund (LCF), we are led by and serve Latino and immigrant community members who share a vision of a brighter, stronger economic future for us all that includes living wages for us all. We know a truly healthy economy is one in which Seattle's local businesses and workforce have the support they need. That's why we support efforts to make Seattle a great, affordable place to work, and requiring that app corporations pay workers fairly is an essential step toward that vision. At LCF we partner closely with Latino-owned businesses, the many Latino and Hispanic workers they employ, and our wider Latino community to build a strong, sustainable local economy that benefits every one of us. Business owners understand that they need customers to grow, and that the more money workers earn, the more they can spend. We know firsthand how much support small businesses need because we work with them every day. COVID-19 forced many to pivot their business models in order to survive, and owners came to us looking for training on things like how to accept online orders and use card readers. They were optimistic that apps like DoorDash and UberEats would help them grow and connect to new customers. But what they also found is that the app corporations increase the cost of doing business, and that small businesses often feel like they have no choice but to use them. The corporations put small businesses in a position of getting on board with their obscure policies, their fees, their app interfaces — or getting run over. And they treat gig workers similarly. Instead of using their much-lauded innovative technology to pay tens of thousands of workers in our city a minimum wage, the app corporations have massively raised fees — gouging customers, workers, and small businesses alike. Instead of good-faith efforts at building a balanced economy for employers and workers, the app companies have been hard at work causing frustration and confusion for all of us who use the apps. This response to the new minimum wage law shows that they are not concerned with supporting Seattle's small businesses. If the app corporations truly cared about the Seattle economy, they would eliminate excessive fees and stop fighting the common sense, time-tested policy the rest of us already support: minimum wage for workers. The small businesses we work with care about being good employers and paying workers a living wage. The app companies that are doing everything they can to avoid paying workers fairly, even while they offer billion-dollar stock buybacks and pay their CEOs million-dollar end-of-year bonuses, clearly do not. Rather than sending Seattleites' money to a handful of Silicon Valley CEOs, we should be keeping money here in our local economy. Raising gig worker pay means more money we can keep here at home in the pockets of workers who themselves are customers of our businesses and whose purchasing power is the backbone of our economy. Small Latino-owned businesses have needs that the City can help with, like long-term recovery from the impact of the pandemic, expanding operations infrastructure to scale, and training to integrate new technology and tools like digital marketing to reach new customers. We welcome additional support to ensure that our local economy can grow and thrive long-term, which depends on workers being paid fairly. Local businesses need to be surrounded by a local community who can afford what they sell. Raising wages will accomplish that. Letting a few big corporations have their way will not.

        "text": "Sign In Register In June, British Columbia’s minimum wage increased from $16.75 per hour to $17.40, which is the highest of any province in the country. Proponents of the increase argue that it will reduce poverty—but what does the evidence show? According to a 2021 study, 8.8 per cent of all Canadian workers earned the minimum wage. Of those minimum-wage earners, in British Columbia, just 7.9 per cent lived in households below the low-income cut-off or LICO, which is often used as a proxy for the poverty line.  Put simply, 92.1 per cent of minimum-wage earners in British Columbia lived in households above the LICO threshold, mainly because most minimum-wage workers are not the primary breadwinners in their households, but are rather secondary or tertiary wage earners. Such an individual may be, for example, a spouse working part-time, or a school-aged child still living at home who works part-time. These results are borne out by a separate study, which analyzed the impact of minimum wages in Canada from 1997 to 2007 and found no statistically significant effect on poverty. Another study measured the impact of increases in the minimum wage from 1981 to 2004 and found that a 10-per-cent increase in the minimum wage was associated with a four-per-cent to six-per-cent increase in the percentage of families falling below the LICO threshold, due to a reduction in employment (and correspondingly, a reduction in income).  Indeed, a vast body of empirical research shows that a higher minimum wage actually may hurt—not help—workers as it can have negative effects on employment. Why? Because as the cost of labour increases, employers tend to hire fewer workers (and may even fire workers), and/or reduce the number of work hours for their remaining workers. In other words, we shouldn’t assume that minimum wage workers retain their employment or the number of hours available to work when the government increases the minimum wage. In fact, according to the evidence, both employment and work hours often decrease when minimum wages rise. And unfortunately, the least advantaged are often hardest hit, as younger and less educated workers often suffer the most job losses resulting from higher minimum wages. So, what should the government do? B.C. has some of the highest personal income tax rates in North America, particularly after the provincial NDP government’s recent series of tax hikes, which were exacerbated by federal tax increases. Rather than increase the minimum wage, the government should cut taxes. Moreover, many government benefit programs are based on income, which means that workers at certain income levels will lose some of those benefits—that is, their financial benefits will be “clawed back”—as they earn additional income. At the same time, workers pay higher taxes as their income increases. Economists call this combined effect of clawed-back financial benefits and higher taxes the marginal effective tax rate, or METR. In B.C., METRs hit low-income families particularly hard. In fact, many low-income workers in B.C. take home 40 cents or less on each additional dollar earned due to the METR. Despite any rhetoric from Victoria, the vast majority of minimum-wage workers aren’t poor, which means a higher minimum wage in B.C. won’t meaningfully alleviate poverty. In fact, due to negative employment effects, a higher minimum wage hurts many B.C. workers. If the government wants to help B.C. workers deal with the rising cost of living, it should reduce taxes.

The formula provides an objective and efficient way to set the minimum wage. It also strikes a balance so low-income earners can share the benefits of economic growth and have a safety net during economic downturns. The minimum wage was introduced in 2011 with the initial rate set at HK$28 (US$3.58) an hour. Since May last year, it has been HK$40. There has been concern about what impact the new formula will have on business operating costs. Based on my calculation, if the formula had been adopted in 2011, the minimum wage would be about HK$41.7 an hour in 2024, only slightly higher than the current one. The minimum wage that comes into effect using the new formula will be a bit higher than what it would have been had the wage been calculated using the new formula from 2011 onwards, as it will be annually adjusted. When it was released in previous years, the Hong Kong Poverty Situation Report confirmed the continual worsening of the city’s poverty rate. The low minimum wage has been partly to blame. The monthly median income of Hong Kong earners increased from HK$11,300 in 2011 to HK$20,000 in 2023. That’s an accumulated increase of 77 per cent.

        "text": " \nBy\n\nRon Fink\n\n Attention minimum wage workers, the government is here to help you—or is it? The U.S. census estimates that the median household income in Lompoc was $66,947 in 2023 and that 17 percent of the population was living in poverty. In Santa Maria the median income was $81,237 and 13.5 percent of the population lives in poverty. These facts cause the political class to convene panels and small working groups to “have conversations” about the issue; the result is always bad policy. California has been governed by one political party for generations, and the divide between low, medium, and high income has become wider every year because of their shortsighted policy decisions. This year is no different; even though voters were convinced to approve a minimum wage increase to “help the poor” a few years ago, the politicians are at it again. It didn’t work then and won’t work now. Why? State-level politicians, whose primary source of income comes from the fact that they can talk a good game but produce nothing tangible, can’t understand that when you raise the minimum wage the cost of everything low-income earners buy goes up. Folks who earn minimum wage are hardworking people, but the jobs they do don’t command large sums of money. These are usually jobs that don’t require special skills or advanced degrees but still need to be accomplished to provide needed services. Many people start at a minimum wage job and work their way up the wage ladder by seeking more challenging jobs. In November, voters will be asked to approve Proposition 32 which proposes to increase the minimum wage to $18 per hour. That sounds nice, but will it help low-income workers and their families? Not really. In a recent Noozhawk report, CalMatters reported that in California “MIT researchers estimate the average single, childless adult needs $27 an hour to be ‘self-sufficient.’” I am not an economist, but it looks like it’s a fool’s folly to think that continuously raising the lowest wage will ever elevate people out of poverty. Just look at your weekly household budget; it doesn’t matter what income bracket you are in, your cost of living has increased dramatically during the last couple of years, and even though you spend more you are getting less bang for the buck.  It may only be coincidental, but cost increases seem to track with minimum wage increases, thus for the low-income worker the wage increase has always been nullified by increased costs to survive. If raising the minimum wage isn’t the answer, what is? One way to improve family wealth is to reduce the cost to produce what people need. Mounds of regulations designed to save whatever the current concern activists champion just raises the cost of everything from broccoli to a home to live in. Stopping fossil fuel production and mandating limited-range electric vehicles adds more cost to everything we use. Green energy requirements raise the cost of everything from electricity to the cost to construct new buildings or replacing your water heater. The politicians who voters have elected have really messed this one up. Sacramento can’t mandate a living wage to help ease poverty; they have tried, and it didn’t work. Fixing it at this point by trying to stem the upward spiral of the cost of necessities may be impossible. Here locally, a recent report said that Peter Rupert, director of the UCSB Economic Forecast Project, is concerned that “middle-age residents are leaving the area and taking their children with them” (Noozhawk, “Officials Outline Potential Threats to Santa Barbara County’s Economy,” Aug. 23). This, he says, among other things will have “an effect on the county long-term.” Why are they leaving?

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nThe median household income in Lompoc is $66,947, with 17% of the population living in poverty. In Santa Maria, the median income is $81,237, with 13.5% living in poverty. Despite these statistics, the government's solution is to raise the minimum wage, which the author argues will not help low-income workers. The author claims that raising the minimum wage will only lead to increased costs for low-income earners. Many people start at minimum wage jobs and work their way up, but these jobs don't require special skills or degrees. Proposition 32 proposes to increase the minimum wage to $18 per hour, but the author argues this will not help low-income workers. MIT researchers estimate that a single, childless adult needs $27 an hour to be self-sufficient in California. The author suggests that reducing the cost of living by reducing regulations and stopping expensive green energy initiatives could help improve family wealth. Instead, politicians' policies have only led to increased costs and a wider income gap. The author concludes that politicians should stop trying to fix things they don't understand and focus on reducing the cost of living."

        "text": "\n    Editor‚Äôs Note: Rachel Greszler is a senior research fellow in workforce and public finance at the Roe Institute at The Heritage Foundation, a conservative thinktank in Washington, DC. She is also a visiting fellow in workforce at the Economic Policy Innovation Center, a pro-growth research group that advocates for less government intervention. The views expressed here are her own. Read¬†more opinion¬†at CNN.\n \n            Across the United States,¬†about half of all states¬†raised their minimum wages in 2024. Most of those increases went into effect on January 1, while minimum wage hikes also went into effect in Nevada, Oregon, the District of Columbia and various localities on July 1.¬†But the mandated pay increases aren‚Äôt necessarily good news. In particular, the recent wage hikes could deliver the most unintended consequences to the very people they most seek to help.\n     \n            Take California, for example. At $16 per hour, the Golden State has the second-highest statewide minimum wage. It recently¬†imposed a special minimum wage of $20 per hour for fast-food workers.¬†Already, it‚Äôs been¬†a minor disaster.¬†Since the hourly pay raises, scores of fast-food businesses have shut down across the state. The Wall Street Journal¬†reported¬†that some fast-food establishments didn‚Äôt even wait for California‚Äôs new wage law to go into effect and began laying off staff and scaling back workers‚Äô hours before the law went into effect.\n     \n            And that‚Äôs not just true in California. Across the country, some of the hardest hit among the millions of people impacted by job losses or reduced hours following minimum wage increases are fast-food workers.\n     \n            A McDonald‚Äôs advertising campaign boasts that¬†one in eight Americans¬†has worked at the fast-food chain. That figure holds true for my household of eight. My husband was once a McDonald‚Äôs employee. My first foray into the workforce was also as a fast-food worker, as a Pizza Hut employee.¬†But while we both started off in minimum-wage jobs, I‚Äôm happy to report that neither of us is still at the bottom rungs of the earnings ladder. Our fast-food jobs were an important entree, however, into the world of work.\n     \nRelated article\nOpinion: Why Americans are so frustrated with the economy right now\n \n            That‚Äôs true for many Americans. They start out in minimum-wage jobs, but don‚Äôt stay there for long. Today, fewer than¬†one out of every 1,000 workers¬†earns the minimum wage, and 60% of those who do are under age 25.\n     \n            That‚Äôs a good thing, because the minimum wage can‚Äôt support a family. But minimum-wage jobs are important stepping-stones, allowing workers to gain experience and move up to higher-paying jobs. Those jobs will become increasingly inaccessible however if lawmakers continue to increase the wages employers must pay to fill them.\n     \n            Numerous cities and states are going full steam ahead with plans to raise wages for entry-level workers. On July 1, Chicago‚Äôs¬†hourly minimum wage increased¬†to $16.20. Oregon‚Äôs minimum wage rose to $17. And¬† where I live‚Äîin Montgomery County, Maryland just outside of Washington, DC ‚Äî the minimum wage rose to¬†$17.15 for companies with more than 50 employees.\n     \n            In Congress, some two dozen Democratic senators, including US Sen. Bernie Sanders, a longtime champion of the $15 minimum wage, are now pushing for a federal minimum wage of¬†at least $17 per hour.\n     \n            Rising wages are a great thing when they are the natural result of workers becoming more productive. Pay increases that result from government mandates can eliminate entry-level job opportunities and lead to a cascade of other unintended consequences.\n     \n            Consider how inflation recently increased the costs of everything from groceries to gas to rent. People resent paying more for the things they‚Äôre used to buying. They either have to do without,¬†find less expensive alternatives or figure out a way to make more money.¬†The same is true for employers. When their labor costs go up, they either have to cut their costs or increase their revenues. That can include reducing employee benefits or eliminating jobs, increasing their use of automation, or raising their prices for consumers.\n     \nRelated article\nOpinion: The economy is strong, but it might not be enough for Biden\n \nIn a report¬†published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists who examined every study on the minimum wage in the US over the past three decades concluded that there was a ‚Äúclear preponderance‚Äù of employment losses as the minimum wage rose, with teens, young adults, and less-educated workers experiencing the greatest losses. In other words, increases in the minimum wage often hurt the very people they‚Äôre meant to help.\n     \n            In short, high minimum-wage laws cut off the bottom rung of the career ladder, effectively pricing the least-advantaged workers out of employment. In South Carolina,¬†researchers found¬†that the most recent minimum wage hike reduced employment by 8.9% for teens, and by 15.5% for workers with less than a high school diploma.\n     \n            A $17 minimum wage ‚Äî as called for in the federal Raise the Wage Act of 2023 ‚Äî means that employers would pay about $42,000 per year for a full-time worker when¬†including all mandatory wages, benefits and taxes. Since many young¬†and less educated workers are simply not capable of producing that much value right out of the gate, they could be priced out of the job market entirely. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a $17 minimum wage would cause 350,000 disproportionately younger and less educated individuals to¬†drop out¬†of the labor force entirely.\n     \n            Even workers who keep their jobs and receive higher wages can end up worse off, because employers may make up for higher wage costs by reducing employee benefits.¬†A¬†recent study¬†of retail workers in Texas and California found that a $1, or 9.1% minimum wage increase translated into an 11.6%¬†decrease¬†in total compensation for the average California worker.\n     \n            Some employers compensate by automating low-skill functions, like replacing workers with self-service kiosks.¬†Or, as mentioned above, they raise prices. Since lower-income families spend¬†a higher percentage of their incomes¬†at places like grocery stores and fast-food restaurants, where low-profit margins necessitate larger price increases, they can be disproportionately hurt by minimum-wage-induced price hikes.\n     \n            Moreover, my analysis found that a $17 minimum wage would¬†increase child care costs¬†by more than $7,000 per year for families in low-cost states like¬†Iowa and Kansas, but by less than $900 in high-cost states like Massachusetts and California.¬†In short, family-supporting wages are fundamental to personal and societal well-being, but all that minimum wage laws can accomplish is to make it illegal for employers to hire individuals who don‚Äôt yet have enough experience and education to cover the cost of employing them at artificially high minimum wages.\n     \n            Instead of wage mandates,¬†policymakers should help workers achieve real and lasting income gains without unintended consequences. That¬†should start with¬†expanding alternative education options like apprenticeships, reducing unnecessary burdens on employers that subtract from workers‚Äô wages and eliminating government-imposed barriers to employment, such as unnecessary occupational licensing standards and restrictions on flexible independent work.\n     \n            To prevent employers from giving pink slips to people who want and need to work, policymakers should give pink slips to minimum wage hikes that simply don‚Äôt work.\n     ¬© 2024 Cable News Network.

Get the latest news delivered daily! e-Edition \n\t\t\tTrending:\t\t On April 1, the new California $20-per-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers went into effect. In signing the bill, California Gov. Gavin Newsom rejected the view that such a wage hike — 25% above the state’s current minimum wage — hurts teenagers who disproportionately benefit from fast-food jobs and for whom this becomes their entry into the job market. Newsom said: “That’s a romanticized version of a world that doesn’t exist. We have the opportunity to reward that contribution, reward that sacrifice and stabilize an industry.”In 2019, The New York Times editorial board echoed the theme:“The simplistic view that minimum-wage laws cause unemployment commanded such a broad consensus in the 1980s that this editorial board came out against the federal minimum in 1987, calling it ‘an idea whose time has passed,’ and citing as evidence ‘a virtual consensus among economists.’ The old critique is still put forward regularly by the restaurant industry and other major employers of low-wage workers …“A groundbreaking study published in 1993 by the economists David Card and Alan Krueger examined a minimum-wage rise in New Jersey by comparing fast-food restaurants there and in an adjacent part of Pennsylvania. It found no impact on employment.”The 2019 New York Times editorial board has done a 180-degree turn from what its board wrote in a 1987 opinion headlined “The Right Minimum Wage: $0.00”:“… there’s a virtual consensus among economists that the minimum wage is an idea whose time has passed. Raising the minimum wage by a substantial amount would price working poor people out of the job market …“A higher minimum would undoubtedly raise the living standard of the majority of low-wage workers who could keep their jobs. That gain, it is argued, would justify the sacrifice of the minority who became unemployable. The argument isn’t convincing. Those at greatest risk from a higher minimum would be young, poor workers, who already face formidable barriers to getting and keeping jobs.”In a 1973 interview, Nobel economics prize winner Milton Friedman said, “I’ve often said the minimum-wage rate is the most anti-Negro law on the books.”\n\nNow the “groundbreaking” Card-Krueger study referred to in The New York Times 2019 editorial did, in fact, refute the consensus among economists that government-imposed minimum wage increases cause unemployment and higher prices and give added incentive to cut labor costs through automation. But about the study, The New York Times’ own columnist, economist and Nobel winner Paul Krugman, wrote:“Indeed, much-cited studies by two well-regarded labor economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, find that where there have been more or less controlled experiments, for example when New Jersey raised minimum wages, but Pennsylvania did not, the effects of the increase on employment have been negligible or even positive. Exactly what to make of this result is a source of great dispute. Card and Krueger offered some complex theoretical rationales, but most of their colleagues are unconvinced; the centrist view is probably that minimum wages ‘do,’ in fact, reduce employment. …” (Krugman now supports a minimum wage.)Related Articles\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tLetter: Trump is the fighter America needs\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tRepublican candidates missing so far from California’s next race for governor\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\t‘Degrowth’ theorists plot a world of poverty and misery\t\t\n\n\nOpinion |  \n\n\t\t\tCarlos Perea: Vote yes on Santa Ana Measure DD.

        "text": "I recently had a layover at the Minneapolis-Saint Paul airport on my way to visit my parents in Oregon, so I stopped at McDonald’s for a quick bite. Rather than being greeted by a human cashier, I was met with a hall of self-serve kiosks, where I placed my order and paid for it.  Expect to see a lot more machines and far fewer human workers in states and cities that are artificially driving up the cost of employees through higher minimum wages.  “The government seems stuck on this way of fixing something that doesn't need to be fixed,” Brian Wesbury, chief economist at First Trust Advisors, told me. “It messes up the marketplace, and businesses attempt to find a way around it because these are not market-based wages – and today with robotics and computers they can. So it ends up hurting people.”  While efficient, automation like those ordering screens at the Minneapolis airport is emblematic of what happens when the government distorts the marketplace with a heavy-handed regulatory approach.  Minneapolis has mandated a $15.57 hourly minimum wage – more than twice the federal minimum wage of $7.25 – for large employers, but that wage will apply to all businesses starting this summer. While the airport isn’t technically part of any city, its employers are no doubt forced to offer comparable wages to attract workers.  High wages are having other effects, too. Minneapolis residents will soon be out of luck if they want to call an Uber or a Lyft. Both companies are leaving town in May after the ultra-liberal city council (several of the 13 are declared socialists) applied the minimum wage to drivers, overriding the mayor’s veto. The companies said the mandate makes operations in the city unsustainable.  So in the effort to increase pay for drivers, the city council effectively will strip thousands of jobs and leave many people without transportation.  As Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey said in an interview, “Getting a raise doesn’t do a whole lot of good if you lose your job.” Nice work, Minneapolis. Then there’s California. In what should have been an April Fools’ joke, a law requiring fast-food workers at large chains to earn $20 a hour took effect April 1.  Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, signed the law last year. Obviously, businesses aren’t happy because it's bad for their bottom lines.  Biden's new rule may take your job:Biden claims to stand for women, but his new regulation will kill jobs that women want Newsom admitted as much when he tried to give his buddy Greg Flynn, who runs Panera Bread franchises in California, a loophole from the law. Flynn is a big Newsom donor, and Newsom had demanded a curious exemption to the law for restaurants “making in-house bread.”  After the justified uproar that Flynn was getting special favors, he has said he’ll abide by the higher wage. It’s no surprise that even before the new minimum wage became reality, restaurants started planning layoffs. For instance, Pizza Hut has said it will cut more than 1,000 delivery jobs. Many more are following suit. As any economist could have predicted, these businesses are having to downsize their workforce, reduce hours and raise prices. That’s what happens when the government meddles in the private market.  It’s hard to see how this benefits anyone in the long run. Minimum wage jobs have traditionally existed to give people an entry point into the work world, but government-driven inflated wages will take those opportunities away from inexperienced workers.  And this government intervention ignores that workers have more choices than ever.  “It’s such a competitive marketplace and unemployment is so low that if you’re disappointed in the job in either the culture or the wage or the working conditions, you can move,” Wesbury said. You can always count on Congress’ resident socialist, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, to come up with truly wild (and costly) ideas. He’s a constant pusher of “free” college, student debt forgiveness and high minimum wages. Employers must speak up:Biden's overtime pay proposal is the last thing our economy needs Sanders also says Americans deserve a 32-hour work week. Employers would be forced to continue paying workers the same pay and benefits as they get for working 40 hours. And he’s not just thinking about it – he’s introduced a bill.  Sounds pretty darn good, I have to say.  Unfortunately, in the real world, companies would have to make adjustments to afford this cushy new employee benefit. Employers would either have to hire more workers or lose out on productivity, and consumers would face higher prices as a result. Other unintended consequences would surely follow. Bottom line: The private sector works best when the government gets out of the way. It’s a lesson liberals never seem to learn.  Ingrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

        "text": "Alright. Let’s talk about the rising minimum wage and its profound, devastating implications for the cost of living in California. I recently tried to enroll my child in a summer camp through the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, and guess what? We were met with fewer spots and a whopping 33% price hike. Why? The department is struggling to find enough counselors who are willing to work for $18 an hour. Sure, it’s more than the city’s current minimum wage, but here’s the real kicker: In April, the statewide minimum wage for fast-food workers is going to hit $20 an hour. If that wasn’t bad enough, we can bet that these kinds of wage increases won’t be limited to fast-food workers, and L.A. won’t stop at just $20 an hour.  Of course, recent wage increases throughout California haven’t been confined to seasonal temporary jobs like summer camps. Hospitals across the state are also being forced to raise their wages for their lowest-wage employees to an astronomical $25 an hour. Great news for the employees, right? Well, not quite. The reality is that doing so will set off a domino effect of rising costs for patients and, ultimately, a mass worker exodus from Los Angeles and California.  Consider the impending $20 hourly minimum wage for fast-food workers in the Golden State, set to take effect in April. The implications are dire, especially in cities like Los Angeles, where the cost of living is already skyrocketing. As we witness these wage hikes, everyone – from the business community and government officials to affected employees themselves – must recognize that increased labor costs will inevitably be passed down the supply chain, affecting everything from goods and services to the overall cost of living. And no one is prepared to pay $15 for a Big Mac.  Now, if a worker can pull in $52,000 a year in cities like Turlock, where one-bedroom apartments are being rented out for a little over $1,000 a month, why should anyone stick around in L.A.? Especially when our elected officials are turning the screws on landlords and developers, making prices spiral even more out of control. So, what’s the bottom line? Expect changes. Big ones. Although unions and social justice warriors might throw a fit, astronomical labor costs will force countless businesses to cut their staff and shift to automation, because doing so will be the difference between surviving and shutting their doors.  This alarming scenario raises important questions about the sustainability of California’s economic model. While the state’s $16 hourly minimum wage might sound like a leap forward for economic justice to some, it falls short when coupled with the increased costs that are the result. The state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office even crunched the numbers for us, and, surprise, surprise, they’re not adding up.  Wage hikes will cause other changes Also, in case you missed it, a recent report by the Hoover Institution revealed that hundreds of businesses decided to wave goodbye to California between 2018 and 2022. And that doesn’t even include the businesses that just closed their doors. Why? High rent, high taxes and high employee living costs, not to mention enough red tape to strangle plenty of business owners. That doesn’t quite sound like a love letter to hard-working Californians, does it?  As the state grapples with many economic challenges, it is paramount that we balance pursuits for fair wages with economic sustainability; otherwise, our state will be ravaged by increased costs and job losses that disproportionately harm small businesses and underserved communities. So, policymakers need to engage in meaningful dialogue with stakeholders to ensure fair compensation that doesn’t damage California’s prosperity. Although higher wages are a noble idea, let’s not kid ourselves: There’s no such thing as a free lunch. As the minimum wage climbs, costs do, too, and someone’s going to be picking up the tab. So, before throwing a party when everyday workers start raking in $20 or more an hour, let’s take a step back to make sure that our leaders aren’t marching the state into financial ruin. California’s economic future is on the line, and it’s about time that we put a stop to counterproductive, pie-in-the-sky proposals.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nThe rising minimum wage in California is having devastating implications for the cost of living. A recent attempt to enroll a child in a summer camp through the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks was met with a 33% price hike. The department is struggling to find counselors willing to work for $18 an hour, which will increase to $20 an hour for fast-food workers in April. Hospitals are also being forced to raise wages for low-wage employees to $25 an hour. This will lead to a domino effect of rising costs for patients and a worker exodus from Los Angeles and California. The increased labor costs will be passed down to consumers, affecting the overall cost of living. Businesses may be forced to cut staff and shift to automation to survive. The sustainability of California's economic model is being questioned, as wage hikes are not balancing with economic sustainability. Hundreds of businesses have already left California between 2018 and 2022 due to high rent, taxes, and employee living costs. Policymakers need to balance fair wages with economic sustainability to avoid harming small businesses and underserved communities."

        "text": "Amanda Rose is the founder and CEO of Entrepreneurial and Small Business Women Australia. Source: Supplied. Effective July 1, the minimum and award wage will increase by 3.75% which will see the national minimum wage go up to $24.10 per hour or $913.19 per week based on a 38-hour week. At any other time, this would have been widely accepted as the price of progress, but during an unprecedented crisis in the small business sector, this is a callous kick in the guts. As inflation pushes up the cost of labour, goods, and materials across the board, it’s understandable that the Fair Work Commission wants to ensure those who earn the least in this country can survive in the current cost of living crisis. It’s an inconvenient truth however that small business owners are among those who are earning little to nothing as they are forced to take on multiple roles in order to stay afloat. What’s even more sad is that small business owners are blamed for having small profit margins when in actual fact they have been struggling since the government locked us down. These decisions crippled small business and with the rise in the cost of doing business in Australia, it’s now catastrophic. An unpalatable fact about small business owners is that they work more than the average 38-hour week. A survey found that a quarter of small business owners are clocking in more than 50+ hours per week. At the same time, the latest report from ASBFEO shows 27% of businesses have a turnover of $0 to less than $50,000. A further 32% bring in between $50,000 and $200,000. Out of these paltry earnings, business owners are expected to pay wages, tax, their suppliers, and other expenses associated with the cost of running a business. Finally, if they are lucky, they get to take some of it home for themselves. Cash flow is tight and business owners would rather sacrifice paying themselves to keep their business running. Even a small increase to the minimum wage could wipe out slender profit margins from small businesses and in many cases leave them in the red. What follows is mass closure, empty shop fronts, and derelict streets. This scenario is already playing out as ABS data reflects the dire situation many SMEs are dealing with right now. In 2022-23 the entry rate of new businesses is 16% compared to the exit rate of 14%. Hospitality and construction are in strife and the numbers rolling in show there’s been an increase in unemployment. Australia’s biggest employer also happens to be small businesses. Put two and two together and it’s no surprise that anti-small business government policies have finally come home to roost. What is the solution? Common sense dictates Labor immediately needs to stop adding financial pressures to the small business sector. Small businesses don’t need cybersecurity funding as much as they need meaningful tax breaks and rebates. Instead of expecting small business owners to single-handedly bear the cost of living burden, the government should step in to make it easier for them to hold onto their employees. For instance, entry-level roles should equate to entry-level wages to keep the labour market affordable for employers. After all, it’s better to have a job than to have no job at all if small businesses end up folding. Small business owners are some of the hardest working people in the country yet they’re being openly persecuted for simply having a go. The irony of small business owners dipping into savings, forgoing holidays, sick leave, and compassionate leave to keep their business running while their employees enjoy mandated benefits points to the dysfunctional relationship the government has with this incredibly important sector. In light of such facts, it’s no wonder younger generations aren’t stepping up to start the next generation of small businesses. One can only hope legislators take notice and act to save small businesses before more disappear. Amanda Rose is the founder and CEO of Entrepreneurial and Small Business Women Australia.

        "text": "The minimum wage set by the government, known as the National Living Wage, is increasing by more than £1 for the first time, providing a boost for 2.7 million low-paid workers. The main wage rate is rising from £10.42 to £11.44 an hour and will apply to workers over 21 rather than over 23. Younger workers will also see a rise in the rates that apply to them. However, some businesses say the higher labour costs will make it harder for them to keep prices down. The changes mean:  Samuel, who works at Grindsmith coffee house in Salford, is one of those who will benefit from the increase. The 26-year-old says before the pay hike he was left with about £400 at the end of the month after rent and bills were paid, but felt he was being left \"shorter and shorter\" each time. \"Maybe for a month you'll be like 'oh, I've got money this month' but next month will be a bit of a rough one,\" Samuel says. He says the increase in the minimum wage will make up for the way prices have been rising, and help him afford more than just the essentials. When setting the minimum wage, the government is guided by proposals from the Low Pay Commission. The rising cost of living prompted the independent commission to recommend a bigger rise in the minimum wage.  The government accepted the recommendation, saying it meant the Conservatives' target to \"end low pay\", by lifting the minimum wage to two-thirds of average earnings, had now been met. However, Samuel's employer, Peter Gibson, the director and co-founder of Grindsmith, says businesses are under strain from the rise in wage costs. An increase for the lowest paid means he has to boost wages for other staff to maintain a differential, he says. \"With such a large increase this time, the minimum wage is now catching up to what we would pay our supervisors, so there must be some inflation in their wages as well. \"So for us, as a small business, it's not just a pay increase for minimum wage [workers], it's a pay increase across the company,\" Mr Gibson says. To manage the rise in costs, the company will consider increasing prices and cutting staff hours, he adds. \"Our hand's being forced,\" he says. \"It's not to make the company more money, it's to make the exact same amount of money, at the end, but with higher prices.\" Business and trade minister Kevin Hollinrake conceded that rising wages meant rising costs for firms. \"We should never forget that private sector businesses shoulder the biggest burden in terms of paying the minimum wage,\" he told the BBC.\"But it is really good news for 2.7 million people.\" The Resolution Foundation, an independent think-tank, says the minimum wage increase represented a rise of 7.8% in real terms - once inflation was taken into account - and a 9.8% rise in cash terms. It says pay inequality had fallen significantly since 1999 when the minimum wage was introduced, making it \"the single most successful economic policy in a generation\".

About four-in-ten (38%) say they oppose the proposal, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted April 5-11. The Biden administration and many congressional Democrats favor increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour from the current rate of $7.25 an hour, but the proposal’s fate in the Senate is uncertain. Some senators, including several Democrats, support a more modest increase in the wage.  Pew Research Center conducted this study understand Americans’ views on raising the standard federal minimum wage. For this analysis, we surveyed 5,109 U.S. adults in April 2021. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report, along with responses, and its methodology. Among the public, those who back a $15 minimum wage are fairly divided over how to approach the issue if there is insufficient support in Congress for an increase to that amount this year. A narrow majority of these Americans (54%) say leaders should focus on passing an increase to the wage “even if it may be significantly less than $15 an hour,” while 43% say the priority should be to work to raise the hourly minimum wage to $15 “even if no increase makes it into law this year.” Among those who oppose raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, a substantial majority (71%) say the federal minimum wage should be increased, but that the standard should be less than $15 an hour; those who hold this view account for 27% of the overall public. Only one-in-ten Americans in all say that federal minimum wage should remain at the current level of $7.25 an hour.  Support for raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is extensive across most demographic groups, according to the survey, which was conducted among 5,109 U.S. adults. Black adults in particular stand out for their support: 89% favor raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, including 73% who support the idea strongly. About three-quarters of Hispanic (76%) and Asian Americans (73%) also favor raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, with 52% of Hispanics and 43% of Asians saying they strongly support the idea. White adults, by contrast, are divided: 51% favor raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour – including just 30% who strongly favor it – while 48% oppose it.  About seven-in-ten adults who live in lower-income households (72%) say they favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, including about half (52%) who strongly favor such an increase. Smaller majorities of those in middle- (58%) and upper-income households (55%) say they favor a $15 minimum wage. There are sharp partisan differences in opinions. While 87% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they favor increasing the wage to $15 an hour (including 61% who strongly favor it), 72% of Republicans and GOP leaners oppose the idea (including 45% who strongly oppose it).  People living in areas where the state-level minimum wage is currently $12 or higher are more likely than others to say they favor a federal increase to $15 an hour. About seven-in-ten adults in these places (69%) favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, compared with 59% of those living in places with a minimum wage of less than $12 an hour. While Democrats are largely united in their support for increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, Republicans’ views differ by household income. Lower-income Republicans (46%) are much more likely than middle- (23%) and upper-income Republicans (18%) to say they favor raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Still, a majority of lower-income Republicans (54%) say they oppose such an increase. Similarly, Republicans who live in areas where the state minimum wage is $12 or higher are slightly more likely than those living in places where the $7.25 federal minimum wage applies to say they favor raising the federal minimum to $15 an hour (32% vs. 25%).  Related post: When it comes to raising the minimum wage, most of the action is in cities and states, not Congress  More than half of Americans who favor a $15 federal minimum wage (54%) say that if there is not enough congressional support for such an increase this year, Congress should prioritize increasing the wage even if the new wage is significantly less than $15. These views differ by race and ethnicity, as well as by income. A majority of Black adults who favor a $15 standard (55%) say that if there is not sufficient support in Congress for that to pass, congressional leaders should continue to work for a $15 minimum wage even if no minimum wage increase becomes law this year. Half of Hispanic adults who back the $15 wage also express this view. By contrast, 36% of White adults who favor a $15 minimum wage say Congress should keep pressing for that amount. A majority of White supporters of a $15 federal minimum wage, by contrast, say Congress should work for an increase in the minimum wage even if it is less than $15 an hour.  Lower-income adults who favor a $15 minimum wage are divided on the better approach if there is inadequate support in Congress for the proposal this year: 49% say congressional leaders should prioritize any raise to the minimum that can happen this year, while an identical 49% share say leaders should continue working until they pass legislation raising the wage to $15 an hour. Among higher-income adults who support a $15 minimum wage, majorities say the priority for Congress should be to work to increase the minimum wage, even if the new wage is significantly less than $15 an hour.

Sign up for WeeklyMatters for a Saturday morning digest of the latest news and commentary from the Golden State. This story is part of California Voices, a commentary forum aiming to broaden our understanding of the state and spotlight Californians directly impacted by policy or its absence. Learn more here. Guest Commentary written by Michael Reich is an economics professor and chair of UC Berkeley’s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment.  Justin Wiltshire is an assistant professor of economics at the University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada, and an affiliate of UC Berkeley’s Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. Today, the minimum wage for California fast food workers will increase to $20 an hour, or 25% above the state’s $16 level. And a first-of-its-kind fast food council will give workers, employers and state government the opportunity to come together and set standards for the industry. But rather than celebrating, many headlines are predicting mass layoffs, major burger price increases and even the end of fast food as we know it in California. These headlines reflect an unsophisticated understanding of an outmoded and simplistic theory: In Econ 101, if you increase the price of labor, employers will use less of it or pass along the higher costs to consumers.  This explanation ignores that fast food restaurants have and use their power to set wages and employment levels well below the Econ 101 level. The modern theory of labor markets actually recognizes employers’ wage-setting power and that a higher minimum wage can help overcome this power, ultimately raising both pay and employment.  Outside the theoretical world, economists have conducted hundreds of studies on the actual effects of minimum wage. They repeatedly find that increasing the minimum wage raises the pay of low-wage workers, without leading to even minor job losses. Prices increase by minimal amounts that are too small to deter anyone from buying a burger or taco. Our latest contribution to this research looked at what happened in fast food restaurants after California and New York nearly doubled their minimum wage to $15 over seven and a half years, from the end of 2013 to the beginning of 2022. We compared federal data on fast food jobs in the 36 most populous counties in California and New York – where the minimum wage jumped dramatically – to similar combinations of counties in states that kept the minimum wage at the federal level of $7.25 an hour.  We found that fast food employment in California and New York did not fall, compared to employment trends in the lower-wage areas. In fact, in the low-unemployment years after the pandemic, fast food employers in the $15 counties added workers.  Pizza Hut operators in California recently announced they were laying off delivery drivers and would rely on Uber Eats, DoorDash and other gig delivery services. Analysts blamed the layoffs on the new $20 pay floor. But Pizza Hut began working with those services in 2022 – not to save money but because they couldn’t hire enough drivers. Other national pizza chains have already partnered with delivery companies. Recognizing all of this, a different question emerges: How do we square the absence of negative employment effects with the theory that higher wages means fewer jobs? The answer is power.  When employers have too much power in the labor market, they can (and do) pay workers considerably less. Workers take the low-paid jobs, often because they seem to be the best option available at the time. But those artificially low wages lead workers to quit when they find better-paying options – or when they’re just tired of working for such low wages.  As a result, hiring and maintaining staffing levels becomes more difficult for employers, leaving them with unfilled vacancies.  In recent years, fast food and other low-wage workers have reset the power equation. They have taken to the streets, city halls and state houses to demand better pay, and they have convinced politicians around the country to raise the minimum wage. By raising pay to meet the higher minimums, fast food restaurants were better able to attract workers to fill the vacant jobs. And those workers stayed longer.  Lower employee turnover and fewer vacancies demonstrate how higher minimum wages can result in more jobs. Lower turnover also helps restaurant owners because more experienced workers will be more productive, while the owners save on recruitment and retention costs.  What about prices? Won’t fast-food customers pay a lot more because of the higher wages?  Pundits claim that a 25% increase in the minimum wage means a 25% increase in prices. Again, the real world provides a different answer.  We examined how minimum wage increases in California and New York changed McDonald’s prices. Every dollar increase in the minimum wage led McDonald’s to raise the price of a $5 Big Mac by just 12 cents.  Fast food companies are reporting higher sales and bigger profits than before the pandemic. They have absorbed higher wage costs and remained profitable without reducing fast food jobs. Time and time again, research – and reality – show that raising fast-food workers’ pay in California will only lead to higher living standards for workers and a more equitable economy.

Many headlines are predicting mass layoffs and price increases, but this is based on an outdated economic theory. In reality, increasing the minimum wage can help overcome employers' power to set low wages and raise employment levels. Hundreds of studies have shown that raising the minimum wage increases pay for low-wage workers without leading to job losses. A recent study found that fast food employment in California and New York did not fall after the minimum wage was nearly doubled. In fact, fast food employers in these areas added workers in low-unemployment years. The real reason for layoffs, such as those at Pizza Hut, is often due to difficulty hiring enough workers, not the higher minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage can actually lead to more jobs by reducing employee turnover and making it easier for employers to attract workers. Higher minimum wages have also been shown to have a minimal impact on prices, with a $1 increase in the minimum wage leading to a 12-cent increase in the price of a Big Mac. Overall, raising the minimum wage for fast food workers in California will lead to higher living standards and a more equitable economy."

        "text": "Pope Francis held Mass and urged migrant workers to be paid \"fairly\" as he visited the affluent city-state of Singapore on Thursday on the last stop of his long Asia-Pacific tour. The 87-year-old pontiff said \"special attention\" should be paid to \"protecting the dignity of migrant workers\" in an address to political leaders and dignitaries. \n \"These workers contribute greatly to society and should be guaranteed a fair wage,\" he said. There are an estimated 170 million migrant workers around the world. Most live in the Americas or Europe-Central Asia. \n Cheap labor has been instrumental in the rapid growth of gleaming metropolises such as Dubai, Doha and Singapore – the fourth stop on the pope's Asia tour. About 300,000 low-wage migrant workers are estimated to work in Singapore. Many flock from South Asia and the Philippines, which has a large and devout Catholic majority. Advocates say they are often exploited and endure poor living conditions, including forced dormitory lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"I'm so happy that the pope has chosen to speak on this topic,\" a 34-year-old Filipina domestic helper told Agence France-Presse (AFP), asking not to be identified because she did not have permission from her employer. \n \"Even if they don't raise my salary, I'm still happy to know that the pope is fighting and praying for us,\" she said. The woman said she earned $460 a month in a nation where, according to Ministry for Manpower statistics, the median gross income is $3,985. The pope did not refer to workers in Singapore explicitly. However, his comments are likely to cause unease for a government that denies widespread abuse and is fiercely protective of its image. A spokesperson for the manpower ministry said conditions for workers in Singapore had improved over the years through contract enforcement and other measures. \"Wages in Singapore are determined by the free market and we do not prescribe minimum wages for workers in Singapore, whether local or foreign,\" the spokesperson told AFP. The Argentine pope was otherwise glowing about his hosts, praising the \"entrepreneurial spirit\" and dynamism that built a \"mass of ultra-modern skyscrapers that seem to rise from the sea.\" \"Singapore is a mosaic of ethnicities, cultures and religions living together in harmony,\" he said, painting the population of almost 6 million as a shining light for the world. \"I encourage you to continue to work in favor of the unity and fraternity of humanity and the common good of all peoples and all nations,\" he said. About 30% of Singaporeans are Buddhist, 20% have no religion and the rest are a mix of Catholic, Protestant, Taoist and Hindu. Singapore is the last stop on the pope's 12-day Asia-Pacific trip to boost the Catholic Church's standing in the world's most populous region. Francis has defied doubts about his health during a journey that has taken him from Jakarta's grand mosque to a remote jungle in Papua New Guinea. He has carried out dozens of public engagements, energized congregations and sat for hours in the brutal tropical heat despite recently undergoing hernia surgery and dealing with a string of respiratory issues. In East Timor, he held a mass for 600,000 faithful – almost half the population. Although the crowds were markedly smaller in Singapore, groups of enthusiasts still lined the streets, trying to glimpse the one they call the \"Holy Father.\" An estimated 50,000 people attended a mass in Singapore's national stadium on Thursday evening. \"Francis has this special ability to connect with the people, to touch people,\" said Eveena Job, 21, who was born in India but lives in Singapore with her family. Others did not make it into the stadium and instead sat outside on benches and picnic blankets, watching mass on electronic devices or listening to the faint noise from inside the arena. Genevieve Kamali, a 53-year-old Fijian, missed out on tickets and huddled outside with eight family members. But she was not too disappointed. \"The Holy Father is just a few meters away,\" she told AFP. \"Faith is about not seeing but believing.\"      ",
        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nPope Francis visited Singapore on the last stop of his Asia-Pacific tour, holding Mass and urging fair pay for migrant workers. He told political leaders and dignitaries to pay \"special attention\" to protecting migrant workers' dignity and guaranteeing fair wages. There are an estimated 170 million migrant workers worldwide, with many living in the Americas or Europe-Central Asia. Cheap labor has driven the rapid growth of cities like Singapore, where 300,000 low-wage migrant workers are estimated to work. Many migrant workers in Singapore come from South Asia and the Philippines, where they face exploitation and poor living conditions. Advocates say they are often mistreated and endured forced lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Pope's comments are likely to cause unease for the Singaporean government, which denies widespread abuse and is protective of its image. Despite this, the Pope praised Singapore's \"entrepreneurial spirit\" and dynamism, calling it a \"mosaic of ethnicities, cultures and religions living together in harmony.\" About 50,000 people attended a mass in Singapore's national stadium, with others watching from outside on electronic devices.

        "text": "News News | Aug 7, 2023  A basic tenant of any just society is that a day’s labor should provide enough to live on. The minimum wage must be a living wage – a wage to live here.  What does it cost to live here? A room in a shared house today easily runs upwards of $1,200/month. Federal and state taxes for a full-time minimum wage worker runs about $400/month. Utilities, groceries, car payments and gas easily add another $800/month. A basic Covered California subsidized health insurance plan adds another $80/month (a full-time worker won’t qualify for MediCal).   At the current $15.50 minimum wage, a full-time employee, here, is left with about $3 a day. That’s not a living wage. A single car repair, medical bill, or a rent hike, and there’s nothing left.  The results are seen in widespread help-wanted signs, as our workforce, depleting their savings to live here, packs up and leaves. And with the City Council’s recent 3-2 rejection of a vacancy tax to incentivize empty second houses to sell or rent, nothing is on the horizon that could substantially lower rents, the primary driver of our cost of living. If our goal is become like Vail or Aspen or Incline Village, an exclusive Disney-like enclave for wealthy, seasonal vacation houses served by transient workers unable to put down roots in their community, this is success. If our goal is a vibrant, thriving, and year-round community, the path we are on is unsustainable.  Both the federal and state government define housing as affordable if it consumes less than a third of one’s income. In the above example, that works out to $23/hr. But more than the absolute amount, that minimum wage needs to be tied to automatically adjust with the primary cost of living, rent – so when rent goes up, so does the minimum wage.   That is what I propose: A $23/hr minimum wage, phased in over five years, and then tied to the median cost of rent. Just enough pay so that a single room, in a shared house, is affordable to a full-time worker.   None of this is radical. In the last five years, the state of California raised the minimum wage from $11 to $15.50/hr, an increase of over 40%. Many cities in California, including San Francisco, and Emeryville have minimum wages that are already significantly higher than the state minimum, and 12 states plus the D.C. automatically tie minimum wage increases to the cost of living.   According to the Tahoe tourism industry’s own economic data in their recently published “Destination Management Plan” (Appendix B), tourism industry profits are up by 28% – over half a billion dollars – in the last 5 years. While over that same time, average tourism industry worker pay has actually decreased both in raw dollars, and, accounting for inflation, by a staggering 15%. For perspective, again accounting for inflation, if the five-year increase in tourism industry profits had gone to workers, that would represent an average annual pay increase of $2,880/year – over two months-worth of rent.   The current state minimum wage is so far below our skyrocketing cost of living, that even Vail Resorts, a mega-corporation with no great record of supporting labor rights, now pays a minimum starting wage of $20/hr so employees can have even a shot at living here.   Tahoe’s tourism economy needs to start working for locals – and raising the minimum wage is one part of making this happen.  Many have argued that local workers should not expect to live here at all, that low wage workers should live in Minden or Carson City (places which themselves are rapidly becoming unaffordable) and instead commute to Tahoe. This is classism of the highest order – a statement that Tahoe belongs to the rich, and that the “poors” who serve us, aren’t worthy to be our neighbors. Ethics aside, at a practical level, it’s a strategy that would see tremendously increased amounts of commuter traffic and long-term costs to our environment.   Many have decried that raising the minimum wage will kill jobs, with workers replaced with AI or jobs shipped overseas. This despite both the increase in profits and current epidemic of help-wanted signs throughout our tourism industry, following the 40% minimum wage increases of the last five years. Neither AI nor outsourcing can clean hotel rooms, bus tables, teach swim lessons, or assist special-needs schoolchildren.  The South Tahoe Chamber of Commerce recently made the perverse argument that we shouldn’t pay a living wage at all, because if we did, workers might no longer quality for welfare and food stamps, and children might not be poor enough to need free lunches. As if this was a bad thing. This is “Walmart reasoning” – the idea that taxpayers should subsidize exploitation of labor in a race to the bottom. It cannot go without note, that these same special interest lobbies who opposed every action on affordable housing that could have lowered the costs of living here, now oppose raising wages to make living here possible – squeezing our workforce from both ends.  Ultimately though, the City Council represents the people who live here, and it is in their interests, not special interest lobbies, that the city should act. We have the authority to raise the minimum wage and give the workers in our community a fair shot at living here. The voters, in turn, must hold their representatives to accountable for their choices.  Change is needed. The end of the road we are currently on is a community without soul, without spirit, and without locals – and it is the locals who make Tahoe a home.  \nOct 18, 2024\n  \nOct 16, 2024\n \nOct 16, 2024\n \nOct 15, 2024\n \nJun 14, 2024\n Readers around the Lake Tahoe Basin and beyond make the Tahoe Tribune's work possible.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nA living wage is essential in a just society, but the current minimum wage in California is not enough to cover the cost of living. A room in a shared house costs over $1,200/month, and with taxes, utilities, and other expenses, a full-time minimum wage worker is left with only $3/day. This is not a living wage, and a single unexpected expense can be devastating. The City Council's rejection of a vacancy tax means that rents are unlikely to decrease, making it difficult for workers to afford to live in the area. To address this, the author proposes a $23/hour minimum wage, phased in over five years, and tied to the median cost of rent. This is not a radical idea, as many cities in California already have higher minimum wages, and 12 states plus DC tie minimum wage increases to the cost of living.

Raising the minimum wage would allow workers to afford to live in the area, rather than commuting from elsewhere, which would benefit the community and the environment. Opponents of raising the minimum wage argue that it would kill jobs, but this is not supported by evidence, and the current lack of affordable housing and living wage is unsustainable. Ultimately, the City Council has the authority to raise the minimum wage and should act in the interests of the people who live in the community."

Cancel anytime. Activists appeal for a $15 minimum wage near the Capitol on Feb. 25, 2021, in Washington. Raising the minimum wage is one of the most popular ways to fight poverty. It’s also one of the worst. Even in conservative states like Missouri, the concept of raising the minimum wage is very popular. Missourians have passed ballot initiatives raising the minimum wage in 2006 and 2018, each by substantial margins. They’ll have the chance to do it again this November, with a ballot measure that would raise the minimum wage from $12.30 to $13.75 next year and raise it to $15 in 2026. In theory, these reforms sound great. Hard-working employees get more money — an urgent need as the cost of living has risen over the past few years. The problem here isn’t with the intent, but with the practical consequences. Raising the minimum wage will cost companies more money, and that money has to come from somewhere. When the government forcibly increases the cost of labor, companies can’t simply absorb it, so they respond by reducing employees’ hours and benefits, converting full-time staff to part-time, or laying off workers altogether. Raising the minimum wage would thus increase poverty, not reduce it. The disemployment effects of the minimum wage are well-documented. In their 2022 systematic review of minimum wage research, economists David Neumark and Peter Shirley concluded that evidence from minimum wage studies conducted over the previous three decades “points strongly toward negative effects of minimum wages on employment of less-skilled workers.” Last year, in a written testimony to the Missouri secretary of state, Elias Tsapelas of the Show-Me Institute estimated that a minimum wage hike could cost as many as 12,000 jobs immediately. Some companies that employ minimum wage workers would certainly cut jobs, though not all of them. Restaurants need a certain number of cooks to prepare food, and stores need folks to stock shelves, so laying off workers isn’t an option if these businesses want to continue operating efficiently. Instead, as recent research has shown, businesses offset minimum wage increases by hiring more part-time workers, while reducing their total hours so that they won’t be eligible for costly benefits. In 2021, a group of Business Management researchers looked at how companies responded to minimum wage hikes in California over the course of three years. They found that “for every $1 increase in minimum wage, the percentage of workers working more than 20 hours per week (making them eligible for retirement benefits) decreased by 23.0%, while the percentage of workers with more than 30 hours per week (making them eligible for health care benefits) decreased by 14.9%.” The same study also revealed that, because companies reduced hours for individual employees, “total wage compensation of an average minimum wage worker in a California store actually fell by 13.6%.” It’s no wonder that most economists warn voters against raising the minimum wage. A 2022 survey conducted by the Institute of Labor Economics found that, of the 160 economists who responded, 71% agreed that it would lead to job losses in the hospitality industry. 39% of the economists surveyed said that a $15 minimum wage would increase poverty. Nonetheless, many self-proclaimed “pro-labor” activists seem to believe that the only way to get companies to pay their employees more is if the government forces them to. Commenting on a fast food workers strike in St. Louis, the editor of the Labor Tribune writes that prices for everything have been going up for more than a decade, except for the price of workers’ labor. This is false on two counts: not only did the minimum wage increase in 2018, wages for fast food workers have actually gone up even further. According to the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center, the average fast food cook made $9.05 an hour in 2014. By 2023, cooks earned an average of $13.86 an hour — a nearly 35% increase (19% after adjusting for inflation). Workers in other traditionally low-wage occupations also saw their incomes rise. Inflation-adjusted hourly wages for retail cashiers, for example, went up by 15% over the same period. In a mostly free and dynamic economy, wages tend to go up over time. But when voters or politicians try to interfere and speed up this process by mandating even higher hourly wages, it is workers who end up paying the price.

The cost of living has gone up more than 45% since then, with rents and home prices rising faster than incomes in most regions of the country. Yet the nation’s wage floor has stayed stuck at $7.25 an hour. That is poverty pay, and an increase to the federal minimum wage is long overdue. It’s mind-boggling that Congress has gone so long without making even modest adjustments to help the lowest-paid workers. This is the longest stretch of time without an increase to the federal minimum wage since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, which established the right to a minimum wage. ADVERTISEMENT Certainly there have been some attempts to lift the wage floor. Most recently, Democrats floated the Raise the Wage Act of 2023 that would have gradually increased minimum pay to $17 by 2028. Republicans countered with $11 phased in over four years. Neither proposal has moved forward. As part of her economic plan, Vice President Kamala Harris has called on Congress to send her a bill raising the minimum wage. She supported $15 an hour during the 2020 election, but hasn’t named a number this time. Former President Donald Trump, not surprisingly, has sent conflicting messages on raising the minimum wage over the years. In 2016, he said he wanted to raise the federal rate to at least $10, but later said minimum wage hikes should be left to the states, which is effectively what’s happening now. Some 30 states and the District of Columbia have enacted higher wage floors, and many cities — including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York — have adopted higher base pay than their states in recognition that it is more expensive to live in urban areas. In Seattle and some surrounding cities, the minimum wage is almost $20 an hour. Still, 20 states, bowing to politics and business lobbying, have kept the federal $7.25 an hour as their pay floor. That’s why Congress needs to act, and the next president should commit to signing a wage hike. The minimum wage is supposed to ensure workers can afford basic necessities. It’s hard to imagine, even in less-expensive regions, how an adult can pay for housing, food, health care, and transportation on a full-time minimum wage salary of $15,000 a year. That is below the poverty line for a single parent with one child. When working people earn so little that they could qualify for Medicaid and food stamps, taxpayers end up subsidizing their employers. If the federal minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would be close to $11 an hour now. An estimated 5 million workers earn less than $11 an hour. And let’s not kid ourselves: While earning $11 an hour working full time would lift a single parent out of poverty, it’s probably not enough to pay the bills and save for a rainy day. ADVERTISEMENT There will always be debate over the correct level at which to set the minimum wage to help the most workers with the fewest negative consequences, which could include businesses cutting low-wage jobs to save money. Yet it should be clear that $7.25 is now woefully low and no longer a fair wage floor. Everyone benefits when working people earn a decent living, and raising the federal minimum wage is essential. — Los Angeles Times Editorial Board (latimes.com) WHAT ABOUT MINNESOTA? The minimum-wage situation in Minnesota is a bit brighter than federally. In Minnesota, the minimum wage is set to increase in January to $11.13 an hour for all employees, as the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry\n    \n      announced\n    \n       two weeks ago. The minimum wage now is $10.85 an hour for large employers and $8.85 for small employers, workers in training, and those younger than 18. The 2024 Minnesota Legislature voted to eliminate those reduced minimum-wage categories. — News Tribune Opinion page  ADVERTISEMENT",

        "text": "While organized labor across Nigeria is currently jubilant over their recent win in obtaining a minimum wage increase by fiat, every student of praxeology in Nigeria receives this news with mixed feelings and the utmost reservation, because we are cognizant of the outcomes which inevitably follow from such interventions in the free market. Earlier in May 2024, organized labor (in both public and private sector)—under the auspices of the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC), after putting together some numbers they considered personal living expenses of the Nigerian worker—embarked on a series of nationwide strikes and public agitations in a bid to get a minimum wage increase from the previous N33,000 to N615,000. Mr. Joe Ajero, the President of the NLC, in his statement as quoted by the Premium Times, is seen making the threat that, “if, however, the negotiation of the minimum wage is not concluded by the end of May, the Trade Union movement in Nigeria will no longer guarantee industrial peace in the country.” This, once more, provided evidence that use of threat and violence are inherent in labor unionism. Following these developments, a series of wage negotiations were initiated, with concessions made on both sides (i.e., the workers and the government). The Nigerian government finally acquiesced to the pressures exerted by the trades union, and organized labor was able to exit negotiations with an estimated 133% increase in minimum wage—to N70,000 per month. That a higher wage is preferable to a lower wage is not disputed. What concerns the student of praxeology is the rigorous investigation of the means chosen to attain these higher wages. The praxeologist always asks whether the means adopted to attain desired ends—in this case, higher wages for Nigerian workers—bring about the attainment of those ends. At the same time, the student of praxeology also considers economics—the most elaborated subdivision of praxeology—a universally-valid science of human action, and therefore, the application of its theories not to be delimited by geography or historical context. As long as man must act to remove uneasiness, economic theory holds, always and everywhere, that there is human action, including Nigeria. The purpose of this article is to show the predictions of Austrian economic theory concerning the necessary outcomes of minimum wage increases by violent intervention in general, as well its implications for the Nigerian workers. Austrian economic theory has always shown that violent intervention in the free market always produces outcomes which are judged unsatisfactory, even from the point of view of the initiators of these interventions. It asserts that intervention in the free market via minimum wage laws, or coercive actions of the trade union, would lead to the unemployment of a section of a country’s labor force who are willing to sell their labor (all other things being equal). Murray Rothbard in his classic Man, Economy, and State, writes, Compulsory unemployment is achieved indirectly through minimum wage laws. On the free market, everyone’s wage tends to be set at his discounted marginal value productivity. A minimum wage law means that those whose DMVP is below the legal minimum are prevented from working. The worker was willing to take the job, and the employer to hire him. But the decree of the State prevents this hiring from taking place. (italics in original) And Mises, in his book Interventionism, puts it that, “to deny that raising wages above the point prescribed by market conditions must necessarily lead to a reduction in the number of employed workers is tantamount to asserting that the size of the labor supply has no influence on wage rates.” A historical investigation of the effects of minimum wage laws in any country inevitably reveals that minimum wage laws always result (all other things being equal) in unemployment of a section of the workers willing to sell their labor, thus further confirming the conclusions of economic theory on wage interventions. That understood, we return to the objectives of the Nigerian government and the NLC in imposing a minimum wage increase by statutory law in order to see whether the chosen means—intervention—proves effective towards attaining that end. The objective of the Nigerian government and NLC is to increase the overall wage of the Nigerian worker, however, given their adoption of coercive intervention in attaining that end, the more unsatisfactory outcome of unemployment of a section of the country’s skilled labor force must follow. In addition to the unsatisfactory outcome of unemployment, the wages of unskilled labor will also decrease because of the entry of these unemployed masses of skilled workers into the unskilled labor market. From this, we can say that the current win by the NLC in obtaining a minimum wage increase by statutory law, rather than market methods, is only a pyrrhic victory. How then could wages be increased for every Nigerian worker, without incurring some hidden, long-term consequences that would disrupt maximal satisfaction of most urgent wants of any group of Nigerian workers? The solution is an increase in the per head accumulation of capital. Economics recognizes that increases in per head capital accumulation would lead to higher marginal productivity of labor. When labor has access to better tools and machines, its contribution to the marginal product increases. This is the only way to increase wages for every Nigerian worker without disrupting the free market and without making any section of the population worse off in the long run. A return to the Misesian concept of “rightly understood” long-run interest, as expounded by Mises in his short book, The Clash of Group Interests, would work to the advantage of every Nigerian worker. The Nigerian worker ought to see that it is in his best long-run interest that mere short-run gains that compromise social cooperation are renounced. Mises succinctly summarizes this point, The sacrifice that a man or a group makes in renouncing some short-run gains, lest they endanger the peaceful operation of the apparatus of social cooperation, is merely temporary. It amounts to an abandonment of a small immediate profit for the sake of incomparably greater advantages in the long run.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nThe Nigerian government has increased the minimum wage from N33,000 to N70,000 per month following nationwide strikes and agitations by organized labor. The increase is a 133% hike, but students of praxeology are concerned about the outcomes of such interventions in the free market. The use of threats and violence by labor unions is evident in their tactics. Austrian economic theory predicts that minimum wage increases by violent intervention will lead to unemployment of a section of the labor force. This is because minimum wage laws prevent people from working at a wage they are willing to accept. The theory asserts that intervention in the free market via minimum wage laws will lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. Historical investigations have shown that minimum wage laws result in unemployment of a section of the workers willing to sell their labor. The increase in minimum wage will lead to unemployment of skilled labor and decrease wages for unskilled labor. To increase wages for every Nigerian worker without incurring negative consequences, an increase in per head accumulation of capital is necessary. This would lead to higher marginal productivity of labor and increased wages without disrupting the free market."

Updated: October 20, 2024 @ 8:34 am  Rachel Greszler WASHINGTON (TNS) — My foray into the workforce was a minimum-wage job making pizzas and washing dishes at Pizza Hut. The money I earned supported my spending as a new driver and taught me how to budget and save for the future. And the experience I gained — everything from teamwork to customer service to safety standards — has carried with me throughout my career. If I were growing up in California today, that same job opportunity probably wouldn’t exist. As a 16-year-old without experience, I couldn’t produce $20 per hour of value for Pizza Hut — or probably any company. But $20 per hour is where Assembly Bill 1228 in California sets the bar for fast-food workers. After factoring in mandatory employment taxes, that comes out to more than $48,000 per year for a full-time employee. Not surprisingly, multiple Pizza Hut franchises announced they are laying off 1,200 delivery drivers. These drivers are likely just the first of potentially thousands more fast-food workers who will lose their jobs. Like me, most Americans start out earning the minimum wage. And like me, most Americans are not capable of producing over $48,000 in value right out of the gate. Mandating the employers pay workers more than they can produce simply raises the bar on employment, excluding those who cannot reach it yet. When lawmakers attempt to “help” lower-wage workers by mandating higher minimum wages, they often end up causing more harm than good. As the late Walter Williams warned about minimum-wage laws, “intentions have no effect on outcomes.” The unintended negative outcomes of minimum wages increases are well documented. Multiple analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimate that large federal minimum wage increases would: cost hundreds or thousands or millions of jobs; drive up prices, interest rates, and federal deficits; reduce total family incomes; and cause hundreds of thousands of workers who lose their jobs to permanently drop out of the labor force. Individuals with low-education, disabilities, criminal records, limited English, and teens are most likely to lose their jobs. A study by the Employment Policies Institute found that the 40% increase in the minimum wage in 2009 contributed to a 15.5% decline in employment among workers with less than a high school diploma and an 8.9% decline in teen employment (which rose to 29.8%). Minimum-wage jobs aren’t meant to be careers or family-supporting jobs, but they nevertheless play a crucial role as a stepping stone into more advanced and higher-paying employment. The individuals who have initial job opportunities cut off by precipitous minimum-wage hikes suffer lifelong consequences. Studies show that workers who held part-time jobs as teens have 7% higher earnings than their peers who didn’t have part-time jobs. Further, individuals exposed to high minimum wages have lower future earnings, and those who suffer job losses from minimum-wage increases are more likely to be arrested for property crimes. Another consequence of minimum-wage hikes is higher prices because naturally, when employers have to pay workers more to do the same thing, they have to raise their prices. When New York City increased its minimum wage from $13 to $15, 86% of restaurants said they raised their prices, and 40% reported losing repeat customers. Fewer customers means fewer workers are needed. Even more seasoned workers who retain their jobs could be worse off despite receiving a pay raise. That’s because restaurants in California could also adjust to the $20 minimum wage by cutting worker hours, eliminating benefits like health insurance and imposing on-demand scheduling. California lawmakers may think that mandating higher wages could help address issues like housing unaffordability, high crime rates, homelessness and rising costs, but the evidence shows it could have the opposite effect. That’s because laws can’t create higher incomes — they can only redistribute incomes. The only way workers can achieve lasting real wage gains is by becoming more productive. To that end, state policymakers should eliminate unnecessary licensing requirements so that people don’t need a costly license to braid hair or arrange flowers. Federal lawmakers should end the government’s monopoly on registered apprenticeships so that more people can get paid while being trained for successful careers. And all levels of government should remove unnecessary regulations so that more of businesses’ estimated $12,800 per employee in annual regulatory costs could go toward higher wages and investments in workers. Such policy changes may not poll as well as a $20 minimum wage, but they’ll actually help workers. And isn’t that the goal?

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nThe author, Rachel Greszler, recounts her first job at Pizza Hut, where she learned valuable skills and earned a minimum wage. She notes that if she were a teenager in California today, she wouldn't have that same job opportunity due to Assembly Bill 1228, which sets the minimum wage for fast-food workers at $20 per hour. This wage is equivalent to over $48,000 per year for a full-time employee, which is unrealistic for most entry-level workers. As a result, multiple Pizza Hut franchises have laid off 1,200 delivery drivers. Mandating higher minimum wages can harm workers by excluding those who cannot produce that level of value. Minimum-wage jobs are meant to be stepping stones to more advanced employment, and cutting off these opportunities can have lifelong consequences. Studies show that workers who held part-time jobs as teens have higher earnings later in life, but high minimum wages can lead to lower future earnings and even increased crime rates. Raising the minimum wage can also lead to higher prices, reduced hours, and eliminated benefits for workers. Instead of mandating higher wages, policymakers should focus on eliminating unnecessary regulations and licensing requirements to help workers become more productive and achieve real wage gains. The author argues that these policy changes may not be popular, but they would actually help workers in the long run."

It also indicated that the government should instead find ways to manage inflation rates to bring down the costs of basic necessities. “The government should find ways to manage inflation rates to reduce the costs of basic necessities so we do not have to resort to regular wage hikes,” Mandaue Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) president Mark Anthony Ynoc told SunStar Cebu in a text message on Monday, Sept. 16, 2024. Ynoc stressed that the increase in the minimum wage by P33 or P43 could lead businesses to raise their prices, which could further fuel inflation. SMEs He emphasized that the business sectors most affected are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as some of them are just starting out. “Companies, especially SMEs, are forced to cut jobs to maintain profitability and competitiveness,” he said. He noted that the wage increase will significantly contribute to the “increase in companies’ operating expenses,” which will consequently be passed on to customers. Operating expenses are the costs a company incurs to keep its day-to-day operations running smoothly. These expenses are essential for a business to function and generate revenue, including payroll from salaries, wages and benefits for employees. Thus, Ynoc said this might lead to potential job losses since labor costs are a major expense in most industries. “This will affect the business sector’s competitiveness as prices will go up,” he explained. Meanwhile, the Cebu Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCCI) hopes the recent decision by the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) 7 regarding wage adjustments will not burden businesses, particularly those classified as SMEs, which serve as the backbone of the regional economy. SMEs operate with limited profit margins and lack the capacity to absorb additional costs, including labor, CCCI stressed. THE RTWPB 7 approved the increase of the daily minimum wage rates of workers in private establishments in the region. In a statement, the Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) said the RTWPB set the increases in the daily minimum wage rates from P33 to P43 per day, starting on Oct. 2. The increase brings the daily minimum wages from P458-P468 to P501 for the workers in private establishments under Class A or the Cities of Carcar, Cebu, Danao, Lapu-Lapu, Mandaue, Naga and Talisay and the municipalities of Compostela, Consolacion, Cordova, Liloan, Minglanilla and San Fernando, and from P425-P430 to P463 in other cities not classified under Class A, which include Bais, Bayawan, Bogo, Canlaon, Dumaguete, Guihulngan, Tagbilaran, Tanjay and Toledo. For Class C or the municipalities not covered under Class A and B, the daily minimum wage was increased to P453 from P415-P420.  “The new rates for workers in private establishments translate to about a seven-eight percent increase from the prevailing daily minimum wage rates in the two regions and result in a comparable 11 percent increase in wage-related benefits covering 13th month pay, service incentive leave, and social security benefits such as SSS, PhilHealth and Pag-Ibig,” the Dole said. “The wage orders are expected to directly benefit a total of 1.2 million minimum wage earners in these regions and about 2.7 full-time wage and salary workers earning above the minimum wage may also indirectly benefit as a result of upward adjustments at the enterprise level arising from the correction of wage distortion,” it added.

        "text": "Gus Carlson is a U.S.-based columnist for The Globe and Mail. As cautionary tales go, the minimum wage mess in California is a compelling one for lawmakers anywhere who seek to tinker with free market forces to make political hay and succeed only in hurting the very constituents they hope to benefit. The California situation is a textbook example of how not to go about things. Last September, Governor Gavin Newsom raised the minimum wage for the 500,000 workers in the state’s quick-service restaurant sector by almost 25 per cent, to US$20 an hour. The law, which came into effect in April, applies to any chain with 60 or more restaurants nationwide, among them well-known names such as McDonald’s, Burger King and California’s own In-N-Out Burger. The domino effect of the backlash has been swift and sharp. Since the new law was announced, more than 10,000 QSR jobs in the state have been eliminated. More cuts are planned this year, including almost 1,300 drivers at chains such as Pizza Hut and Round Table Pizza. Many restaurants also raised prices, which dampened consumer demand. Few people want to pay US$20 for a hamburger meal – that is the antithesis of the fast-food concept of convenience at a wallet-friendly price point. As a result of softer sales, many locations have cut back hours for employees. So, even though workers are making a higher wage, those who survived layoffs are often logging fewer hours, and the net gain of the new law is muted. Further, and more potentially devastating to work force numbers, the wage hike has added new impetus to the sector’s push to automation. New technology companies such as Navia Robotics and Nuwa Robotics have emerged in the artificial intelligence and robotics space to develop systems that will accelerate the evolution of fast-food restaurants to automation and away from human staff. That doesn’t bode well for people. As automation becomes the rule not the exception, the prospect of more job losses is very real. To be sure, the concept of a minimum wage has merit in its intent to protect low-paid workers by providing an enforceable baseline value for their labour. The problem comes when legislation such as California’s is applied selectively and punitively to drive a political agenda. While politics are certainly at play in the California scenario – Mr. Newsom, a progressive Democrat, has a notoriously anti-business agenda – it is a two-way street. Lawmakers on the other side of the ideological aisle who seek to depress minimum wages unfairly are equally culpable. Georgia and Wyoming, for example, both have Republican governors and state minimum wage rates below the federal rate. Like anything, the minimum wage equation is about balance. That’s why it is so challenging for legislators around the world to settle on appropriate rates. Most industrialized countries have minimum wage structures – some are broad and all-encompassing; others are tiered across local, state, provincial and federal levels to reflect the economic differences and disparities of a national landscape. In the United States, for example, the federal minimum wage is US$7.25 an hour. Currently, 34 states, territories and districts have their own rates, as well. In states that have minimum wage rates in addition to the federal rate, employees are entitled to the higher of the two. By comparison, Ottawa raised Canada’s federal minimum wage to $17.30 on April 1. Provinces and territories also set minimum wages as part of their labour laws. Done properly and fairly, despite predictable ideological grumbling on both sides, a minimum wage can be a valuable element of a healthy economy. Done poorly and unfairly, it can result in something like California’s predicament – massive job losses and higher prices driving consumer unhappiness, resulting in fewer hours for those workers who remain and an acceleration of the shift to automation that will prompt further job losses. While perhaps politically expedient for its advocates, the new California law has quickly become an economic lose-lose-lose scenario for workers, consumers and employers. Regardless of your political stand, the point is clear. Lawmakers of any stripe who seek to manipulate free markets without understanding the balance required to keep economic engines chugging along should beware. Minimum wages have their place in the economic mix, but like any component in the bigger machine, if they get out of whack in terms of size and influence, things will go wrong until balance is restored. It is unclear if California has the political will to recover from its misstep in the QSR sector. Still, lawmakers everywhere struggling with minimum wage calculations should watch the Golden State carefully and understand the consequences, intended and unintended, of actions that threaten the balance of a free market. The ultimate litmus test lies in whether any action will do no harm and actually help people it is intended to benefit. California got the answer wrong. But at least it may be a learning moment for anyone else wrestling with this issue.

The cost of living has gone up more than 45% since then, with rents and home prices rising faster than incomes in most regions of the country. Yet the nation’s wage floor has stayed stuck at $7.25 an hour. That is poverty pay, and an increase to the federal minimum wage is long overdue. It’s mind-boggling that Congress has gone so long without making even modest adjustments to help the lowest-paid workers. This is the longest stretch of time without an increase to the federal minimum wage since President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1938, which established the right to a minimum wage. Certainly there have been some attempts to lift the wage floor. Most recently Democrats floated the Raise the Wage Act of 2023 that would have gradually increased minimum pay to $17 by 2028. Republicans countered with $11 phased in over four years. Neither proposal has moved forward. As part of her economic plan, Vice President Kamala Harris has called on Congress to send her a bill raising the minimum wage. She supported $15 an hour during the 2020 election, but hasn’t named a number this time. Donald Trump, not surprisingly, has sent conflicting messages on raising the minimum wage over the years. In 2016, he said he wanted to raise the federal rate to at least $10, but later said minimum wage hikes should be left to the states, which is effectively what’s happening now. Some 30 states and the District of Columbia have enacted higher wage floors, and many cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City, have adopted higher base pay than their states in recognition that it is more expensive to live in urban areas. In Seattle and some surrounding cities, the minimum wage is almost $20 an hour. Still, 20 states, bowing to politics and business lobbying, have kept the federal $7.25 an hour as their pay floor. That’s why Congress needs to act, and the next president should commit to signing a wage hike. The minimum wage is supposed to ensure workers can afford the basic necessities. It’s hard to imagine, even in less expensive regions, how an adult can pay for housing, food, healthcare and transportation on a full-time minimum wage salary of $15,000 a year. That is below the poverty line for a single parent with one child. When working people earn so little that they could qualify for Medicaid and food stamps, taxpayers end up subsidizing their employers. If the federal minimum wage had kept up with inflation, it would be close to $11 an hour now. An estimated 5 million workers earn less than $11 an hour. And let’s not kid ourselves — while earning $11 an hour working full time would lift a single parent out of poverty, it’s probably not enough to pay the bills and save for a rainy day. There will always be debate over the correct level at which to set the minimum wage to help the most workers with the fewest negative consequences, which could include businesses cutting low-wage jobs to save money. Yet it should be clear that $7.25 is now woefully low and no longer a fair wage floor. Everyone benefits when working people earn a decent living, and raising the federal minimum wage is essential. — Los Angeles Times Dubbed the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States since Maria in 2017, Helene has already claimed more than ...

The zones would be used for wind farms, solar panels, and other renewable energy projects. Many farmers are worried that the projects would take up valuable agricultural land and affect their livelihoods. The Victorian government has been promoting renewable energy as a way to reduce carbon emissions and meet climate change targets. However, regional Victorians argue that the government is not considering the impact on their communities. They are calling for more consultation and consideration of the effects on rural areas. The debate has sparked a heated discussion about the balance between renewable energy and preserving agricultural land. The outcome of the debate will have significant implications for regional Victoria and its communities."

        "text": " Workers take down a wind turbine tower for repair at the KMC Sportsman Lodge in Gurnsey County,... [+] Ohio, 2012. Photographer: Ty Wright/Bloomberg  I'm a firm believer that we must support ALL energy sources because each of them will have a key role to play in the years ahead. Unfortunately, I've also come to notice that those in the renewable energy business are much more anti- coal, oil, and natural gas than the latter group is against the former, creating an \"us\" versus \"them\" mentality that ignores the fact that ALL energy sources have pros and cons. So, a reality check is in order, especially since there's a growing and dangerous push to 1) NOT produce more fossil fuels, 2) NOT build more related infrastructure, and/or 3) hurt the companies that produce our coal, oil, and gas. As New England is finding out, where a lack of pipelines to access lower cost Pennsylvania shale just means more costly gas imports from Yemen (here), all the anti- coal, oil, and gas push does is help foreign suppliers because our demand isn't going away.  The movement against more coal, oil, and gas use faces a number of problems and unintended consequences that don't go so easily ignored in the real world as hoped. 1. The goal to lower coal, oil, and gas use faces a fundamental economics problem: less fossil fuel usage lower their prices, thereby increasing the attractiveness of using coal, oil, and gas. For example, sunken gasoline prices are hurting electric vehicle sales. 2. Significantly less coal, oil, and gas use will create huge job losses, hurting families and communities, creating even greater resentment across the country. Federal and state funding to alleviate these losses are extra costs that will be measured in the billions of dollars. To illustrate, never mentioned is the Native Americans losing their once steady and high-paying coal jobs because of continuous regulations, devastating tribes that often have over 60% unemployment. \"There are 10 million direct and indirect oil industry jobs in America,\" and highly skilled engineers can easily have annual salaries over $130,000. Globally, some of the world's poorest nations are very resource rich and rely on oil and gas sales for over 70% of GDP, crucial revenue streams that the anti-fossil fuel movement never considers. No solutions are ever given for these problems. In fact, the U.S. solar business has actually been touting the \"there's most solar jobs than coal jobs\" argument even though solar supplies less than 1% of U.S. electricity, and coal supplies over 30%. And the solar business has also touted that it has more jobs than oil and gas....ignoring the fact that oil and gas are 65% of our energy, and solar provides 0%! In other words, the solar business is promoting the fact that it produces less energy with more workers. Indeed, economic majors we are not. Econ 101: jobs are a cost in the process of production; the services a job provides are the benefits. Using more workers to accomplish less is a sign of INEFFICIENCY, and obviously not something to boast about. As for the undefined \"green job,\" my question remains unanswered: \"does the coal miner that mines the coal that makes the steel that makes the windmill have a green job?\" Certainly more so than the lawyers and administration assistants that inexplicably get counted in our \"green job\" tallies. 3. Less coal, oil, gas use will crush tax incomes for states and erode critical budgets (here), already stuck in challenging times since The Great Recession. In Wyoming, coal alone supplies $1.2 billion in taxes per year. In California, the state faces budget shortages because:  \"As motorists use less and less gas, gas tax revenues to pay for state highways, roads and bridges shrink.\" Our largest oil and gas company, ExxonMobil, pays $85 million in corporate taxes...per day! 4. Although seeming like the ultimate \"no-brainers,\" even more policies for efficiency and conservation create unintended problems. Consider California's drought and encouragement for people to use less water:  \"Water departments are increasing rates and adding fees because they're losing money as their customers conserve.\" Fixed costs like repairing pipelines, customer service, and enforcing water restrictions continue to increase, and lost revenue from conservation must somehow be made up, frequently with higher rates. \"Residents in the San Francisco Bay Area, for example, are seeing higher bills after the region's largest water wholesaler increased the price of water 28 percent to make up for lagging sales.\" 5. Indeed, hardly a panacea, more efficiency can actually mean MORE energy use because it lowers fuel costs. For example, \"buy a more fuel-efficient car, drive more.\" Efficiency leads to economic growth for both the overall economy and the individual, causing total energy consumption to increase (“the rebound effect”). Conveniently ignored, we've known this \"Jevons Paradox\" of energy efficiency increasing demand since 1865 (here). 6. California illustrates how even tens of billions spent on more wind and solar ultimately means more natural gas because gas is the more reliable backup for their intermittency. Again, this cannot be overstated: the majority of the time wind and solar power are UNAVAILABLE. Natural gas now produces 61% of California's electricity, up from 47% in 2003 when the state implemented it's first Renewable Portfolio Standard. This explains why wind and solar are in reality more \"supplemental\" than \"alternative,\" and why I'd argue that more R&D to lower the cost of renewables and create a way to store electricity at large-scale are far more important than building wind and solar farms (\"Obama-Backed Solar Plant Could Be Shut Down For Not Producing Enough Energy\"). Never mentioned is the fact that Europe's wind power capitals of Germany and Denmark have home electricity rates of 40 and 42 cents per kWh respectively, compared to just 12.7 cents in the U.S. 7. Fossil fuel inputs are enormous, no matter which direction our energy system goes. Our entire complex is built on fossil fuels, so more wind and solar inevitably mean more coal, oil, and gas use. For example, diesel oil trucks are what move windmills and solar panels, and there's about 150 tonnes of metallurgical coal via steel in an onshore windmill - and 250 tonnes of coal in an offshore one. Still the best read here on the conveniently forgotten headwinds that non- coal, oil, and gas energy sources face in a world built on coal, oil, and gas, ultimately it's evolving fossil fuel technologies that will reduce emissions most, not more wind and solar. 8. A global perspective is always required. With 6 in every 7 humans still living in undeveloped nations, the world has JUST STARTED to consume energy. The developing world has made it understandably very clear: poverty reduction is a first and overriding priority. There are 2,100 coal plants planned around the world.  The reality is that we will continue to see all energy sources, all of the time. Energy, after all, is the driving force of economic development and economic development is the driving force of longer, healthier lives. Got an energy project to install? The answer is \"yes.\" 9. Contrary to what you're being told, renewables are not \"new,\" and in fact wind and solar were some of the first sources of energy (here, here). But, the world moved on, and in the 1800s coal, oil, and gas took the reins. The world moves forward, not backward, explaining why the next energy system is likely to be something completely new, like fusion, fission, hydrogen, or something else we've never seen before. 10. Scale and Irreplaceability. Too many Americans seem unable to grasp the sheer scale of our energy system, a monstrosity that devours 100,000 tons of coal, 35 million gallons of oil, and 3 billion cubic feet of natural gas...every hour. As sources of electricity, wind and solar don't even compete in 60% of our energy system. Mr. Musk's shaken dreams (\"fueled by $4.9 billion in government subsidies!\" mind you) provide a prime example of just how dominant more reliable and more affordable fossil fuels are. The U.S. is now back selling over 17 million oil-based vehicles per year, and less than 150,000 of them run on electricity. And don't forget: in any event, nearly 70% of our electricity comes from coal, oil, and natural gas.

(Photo by STR/AFP via Getty Images) The world added 473 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity last year, according to a new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, and four-fifths of it produces power more cheaply than fossil fuels do. The added capacity, roughly equivalent to 473 nuclear plants, produces electricity at prices most fossil plants can’t match and that the nuclear industry can only dream of: The global average cost of electricity from onshore wind fell to 3.3 cents per kilowatt-hour, 3 percent less than the year before, and utility-scale solar photovoltaic fell to 4.4 cents/kWh, 12% less than the year before. Fossil-fuel prices rose in 2023 to 10 cents/kWh, according to IRENA’s report, which largely ignores nuclear power (new nuclear has been estimated to cost as much as 25-30 cents/kWh). “The world is embracing the transition away from fossil fuels,” IRENA Director General Francesco La Camera writes, aided by the continuing decline in technology costs. “The rising competitiveness of renewables in comparison to fossil fuels is driving extensive deployment of (renewables),” the report states. The period from 2010 to 2023 saw a “seismic shift” away from fossil and nuclear in favor of renewables, it says, a trend expected to continue as countries strive to fulfill the pledge, agreed at COP28, to triple renewable-energy capacity by 2030. “In the next few years of this decade, an extensive deployment of renewable power generation in more countries and regions is therefore expected. As the electricity system evolves, innovative technologies are also being introduced to facilitate the transition from a fossil fuel-based system to a renewable one.” For renewables to compete with fossil fuels and nuclear, storage is vital to provide power during renewable downtimes. “With a growing share of variable renewable power generation, energy storage will play a crucial role in ensuring the successful delivery of electricity during supply-demand shortfalls,” the report states, updating battery-storage costs and capacity with good news as well. • Battery storage has grown from 0.1 GWh gross capacity added in 2010 to 95.9 GWh gross capacity added in 2023. • From 2010 and 2023, the costs of battery storage projects declined 89% thanks to improved materials efficiency, improved manufacturing processes and economies of scale. • China is leading the world in new additions of battery storage, with 46.5 GWh of new capacity installed in 2023, accounting for nearly half of global additions. “China represented the largest market for solar PV (63%), onshore wind (66%), offshore wind (65%) and hydropower (44%) in 2023,” the report states, “due to the country’s substantial renewable additions in 2023, which drove the decline in the global weighted average costs for these technologies.” China lays claim to some of the largest solar development projects, including the still-developing Tengger Desert New Energy Base, which reportedly has already delivered more than 2 billion kWh of electricity to neighboring provinces. IRENA estimates that power companies and their customers saved $409 billion in fuel costs from 2000 to 2023 thanks to renewables.  One Community.

        "text": "Modern civilization depends on abundant, affordable, and reliable energy. Policies that ignore this won’t turn out well. Starting this month, everyday citizens, not just hedge fund managers and traders, will be able to make direct bets on “big” issues ranging from basic economic indicators to the weather. Based in Greenwich, Connecticut, the global trading firm Interactive Brokers has won U.S. federal approval to run a “prediction market” platform allowing users to make bets on everything from consumer sentiment to the national debt to “atmospheric carbon dioxide.” As the Wall Street Journal reported, “Interactive Brokers said it believes that it ‘can help establish a collective view’ on ‘controversial issues.’” Let’s hope for an opportunity to bet on whether the energy transition, the linchpin of the ruling energy orthodoxy, will in fact happen. The orthodox view, of course, is that it’s already underway, and the world will radically reduce, if not eliminate, the use of oil, natural gas, and coal. This narrative is firmly embedded in plans, policies, and rhetoric on both sides of the partisan divide. Conferences, studies, and consultancies are framed around the transition. Even “Big Oil,” from Exxon to Chevron, genuflects to the narrative. The only substantive debate about the energy transition concerns how fast it’s happening and what should or shouldn’t be subsidized to hasten the inevitable. Meantime, hydrocarbons still supply over 80 percent of America’s and the world’s primary energy needs, roughly the same proportion as two decades ago. But that fact understates reality. Hydrocarbons are used, in one way or another, in everything we build and use to sustain civilization. The goal of the energy transition is not only to eliminate the ubiquity of hydrocarbons but also to do it fast. That is the central objective of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). This is a government enterprise arguably unprecedented in American history, and certainly in the history of industrial programs. A proper accounting of the IRA reveals that its real costs—$2 trillion to $3 trillion—will be far greater than the costs its advocates claim. For context, in inflation-adjusted terms, the U.S. spent about $4 trillion to prosecute World War II. This level of spending, complemented by similar pursuits in about two dozen states, makes the IRA one of the defining issues of our time. It is no exaggeration to say that the realities of energy systems—the physics, the engineering, and the economics—are now central to the future of the U.S. economy, and thus central to our policy and political debates. Society as we know it would not exist if not for vast supplies of energy. Energy is consumed by every invention, product, and service that makes life safe, interesting, convenient, enjoyable, and even beautiful. Energy policies are bets on whether there’s enough energy to meet people’s demands both now and in the future. But underlying that observation is a foundational truth relevant to forecasters and policymakers: throughout history, innovators have invented far more ways to consume energy than to produce it. One of humanity’s remarkable capabilities is to invent future wants—that is, to invent new energy demands. There was no energy demand for air conditioning before its invention. We used no energy for flying until the airplane. The same is true for the car, pharmaceuticals, and computing. The global computing ecosystem now uses more energy than global aviation, and it is growing far faster. And now comes artificial intelligence: in energy terms, AI is to computers what jet engines are to aircraft. Energy policies are thus also bets on what it is possible to build to supply those needs. Supply follows demand, but a lack of supply can also kill demand. The past and present offer ample evidence that the latent energy demands of billions of people across the globe remain underserved. An ironclad hierarchy pertains when it comes to supplying energy. Call it a triumvirate of needs. First, you need enough energy. You can’t consume what you don’t produce. Energy abundance is key. Energy shortfalls stifle economic growth; severe shortfalls are lethal. Second, abundant energy needs to be cheap. Affordability matters. The visible political touchstone for that reality is the price of a gallon of gasoline. More hidden is the industrial touchstone, which is the combined price of hydrocarbons and electricity. Ignoring this hidden reality has led the U.K. and Germany to sink into economically destructive deindustrialization. Third, energy needs to be reliable at all scales and timeframes. Reliability is about meeting the energy demands of people, machines, and systems not only minute-by-minute but also over days, weeks, months, and years. The absence of energy when it is needed can crash both machines and economies. Reliability is the inverse of fragility in energy supply chains. It is the sine qua non that lets low-cost abundance be taken for granted. High reliability allows the energy issue seemingly to disappear from our daily concerns, but behind the scenes it is a Sisyphean struggle. A society must always be designing and building energy supply chains to combat the realities of relentless, often malevolent, interference from nature, accidents, or human choices. It takes a complex and delicate dance to build systems that can simultaneously balance the triumvirate of needs: abundance, affordability, and reliability. The rules to that dance are dictated by the physics of energy and how it is manifested in the machinery we can build and afford. You could call it the physics of money. You may have noticed that I’ve made no mention of the environment in the ironclad energy hierarchy. Abundant, affordable, and reliable energy creates the conditions for wealth that in turn make possible the time and capital required for everything beyond mere survival— from health care to entertainment to the modern luxury of environmental protection. Break the triumvirate of needs, and we know what happens. Throughout history and across the world, we see the correlation between environmental degradation and poverty. When it comes to energy forecasts, the elephant in the room is the climate debate—the ultimate motivation for energy transition goals. But it doesn’t matter what one thinks about climate science when it comes to analyzing the physics and economics of the energy systems that we know how to build. They are entirely separate magisteria. Thus, it was predictable that energy pundits would rediscover the ironclad hierarchy with the rapid expansion of the most recently invented energy-using infrastructure. I’m referring of course to artificial intelligence. It’s a pure example of the invention of energy demands. Electric utilities around the country are now reporting epic jumps in forecasts for near-term power demand. The end of the interregnum of flat growth in electric usage comes not because of enthusiasm for electric vehicles (EVs), or because of the repatriation of semiconductor factories, though both are significant new demand vectors. It comes because the so-called virtual world of software can exist only within the physical world of energy-hungry hardware. The cloud, whether measured in terms of the size of the network, the capital deployed, or the energy used, is on track to become the biggest infrastructure ever built by humanity. Global capital spending on energy-using hardware to build the cloud and its networks now exceeds global capital spending by all electric utilities on energy-producing power plants and those networks. For context, today’s global cloud already consumes ten times more electricity than all the world’s EVs combined. Even if EV adoption expands at the rate that enthusiasts assume, the cloud will still significantly outpace that new demand for electricity, especially with the rush to buy AI hardware. And we are still in the early days of AI adoption. To continue the AI and jet-engine analogy, the aviation industry had been booming for three decades before the 1958 introduction of the first viable commercial passenger jet, the Boeing 707. After that transformative event, flying, measured in passenger air-miles, grew more than tenfold in under a decade and kept soaring. Of course, energy use followed. Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley pioneer and venture capital potentate, said more than a decade ago that he expected “software would eat the world.” He meant that software would disrupt “large swathes of the economy.” He was right, but he may not have imagined that the hardware that makes the software possible would eat the grid. And do you think AI is the last energy-using innovation that will ever emerge? The question answers itself—and that says nothing about the energy implications of billions of people who seek basic economic growth, to rise out of poverty and come to enjoy the benefits of yesterday’s inventions, from air conditioning to cars to airplanes. In timeframes that matter, new demands for energy are practically unlimited. And if we employ common sense, so, too, are new supplies. To return to Andreessen: he has more recently issued a long, impassioned Techno-Optimist Manifesto which includes a specific exploration of energy. “We believe energy should be in an upward spiral,” he observes. “Energy is the foundational engine of our civilization. The more energy we have, the more people we can have, and the better everyone’s lives can be.” Amen. Back to betting markets. I’d take the bets—and I hope Interactive Brokers will offer them—that in the near future we’ll see: global energy use rise, not shrink; global production and use of hydrocarbons expand, not contract, in parallel with rising alternative energy production; the abandonment of the idea of an “energy transition.” These bets all derive from the iron law of the energy hierarchy. Policymakers who bet against reality will face unpleasant consequences. Mark P.

I am proud to be a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), which has been advocating for high safety standards, family-supporting wages, and industry-leading benefits for its members since 1891. The IBEW is working to protect members’ rights and improve working conditions in the current technological and economic revolution. President Biden’s clean energy plan is sparking a new generation of good-paying union jobs that are good for our communities and our planet. But like everything today, Biden’s clean energy plan has been swept up in political games. Some are even arguing for repealing it, but there isn’t anything controversial about creating more good jobs and giving Americans more energy choices. Thanks to the clean energy plan, businesses have already announced more than 300,000 clean energy jobs, and they expect to create millions more over the next decade. Here in North Carolina, we have seen over 4,768 clean energy jobs, and billions of dollars in new investments. The law is expected to bring more than $18.75 billion to clean power generation and energy storage in North Carolina by 2030, which means even more local jobs and opportunities for North Carolina residents. Union jobs are gaining momentum in the growing clean energy economy. The law incentivizes companies to create workforce development and apprenticeship programs that can raise workers’ pay, allowing them to earn $300,000 more in wages and benefits throughout their careers. What’s more, three-fourths of these new jobs won’t require the cost of a four-year degree. Jobs created by the clean energy plan are not only unionized at higher rates than the overall energy workforce, they also have prevailing wage requirements that protect the gains won by Unions and help close racial and gender pay gaps. As an electrician and an IBEW member, I’m proud to go to work every day to build the infrastructure for more renewable energy and a more resilient grid. Renewable energy helps lower harmful emissions that pollute our air and warm our planet. Investing in renewable energy also helps families like mine save money on our electricity bills, which also go up as summer temperatures hit. We can get tax credits and rebates by installing solar panels and switching to energy-efficient appliances. Often, the labor is done by Union workers. It’s a win-win. Thanks to Biden’s clean energy plan, I know jobs like mine will be around for the next generation in every corner of the country—especially in communities that need good jobs and cheaper energy the most. If we keep investing in renewable energy, solar and wind power are only going to get even cheaper and more accessible. I am proud to play a part in helping America lead the world when it comes to modernizing energy infrastructure. At the IBEW, we will continue to demand a just and pro-union future, and to fight for leaders who are working hard to support this mission. Repealing Biden’s clean energy plan would let America fall behind and would pull the rug out from American workers. We need to move forward, not backward. And for any young people who want to help save our planet and have a great paying career: consider becoming a Union electrician.

        "summary": "Here is the summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nAs a union member of LU 553 for 30 years, I know the importance of good-paying, pro-worker jobs. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) has been advocating for high safety standards, family-supporting wages, and industry-leading benefits since 1891. President Biden's clean energy plan is creating a new generation of good-paying union jobs that benefit our communities and the planet. Despite being swept up in political games, the plan has already announced over 300,000 clean energy jobs and expects to create millions more over the next decade. In North Carolina, the plan has created over 4,768 clean energy jobs and billions of dollars in new investments. The law is expected to bring over $18.75 billion to clean power generation and energy storage in North Carolina by 2030, creating more local jobs and opportunities. Union jobs are gaining momentum in the growing clean energy economy, with prevailing wage requirements that protect workers' gains and help close racial and gender pay gaps. As an electrician and IBEW member, I'm proud to work on building infrastructure for renewable energy and a more resilient grid. Renewable energy helps lower emissions, save families money on electricity bills, and provides tax credits and rebates for installing solar panels and energy-efficient appliances. Repealing Biden's clean energy plan would let America fall behind and hurt American workers, so we need to move forward and invest in renewable energy."

It’s never been more important to focus efforts on a renewable energy future.  An outspoken voice on sustainability, Dr. Roberta Boscolo from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) unpacks climate science while providing important insights on both what a climate-changed future will look like and what a renewable economic transformation could bring. Dr. Boscolo has spent her 20+ year career translating science and working closely on the water-food-energy nexus.  Today the world is at 1.5°C; because of the El Niño push. We are not prepared for this, people die from heat strokes and heatwaves. Every degree increase leads to more frequent and increased storms. Sea level rise is changing coastlines. Some properties are uninsurable. We know the costs, we know the cause, and we know it’s in our power to stop. Renewables are an option that can phase out fossil fuels.  The WMO should issue better warnings that include safety measures for people. Current climate futures and risk mapping is based on the past, but what happened in the past will not be representative of the future. AI tools take far less time and computer power to do predictive models. It could be invaluable for developing nations.  EVs, electrified transport and heating are important steps to decarbonize the economy. Batteries are more affordable. We already destroyed the world with oil and gas mining. Critical resource mining is less invasive than oil. We’re not burning them, we can re-use them again and again. There will be a moment when we don’t need to mine anymore, we recycle.  We need to think about big solutions. We will use less energy in renewable systems than we use now due to efficiency and localisation of power networks. Climate change is an opportunity to create new jobs and invest in new technologies. Let’s take this opportunity to innovate and be more sustainable. This is also a big opportunity for developing countries, who can form regional energy hubs to expand access. Instead of an oil economy with one nation gaining wealth, wealth will be expansive to all.  We hope so. At this point it’s going to be an overshoot, over 1.5°C. We can still get back to 1.5°C over time. It will be much more difficult now than ten years ago. We are losing time, we are losing our window of opportunity. We should drop at least 50% of emissions by 2030, and continue to net zero. Net zero means everything we emit is absorbed by nature. When China and India are able to stop and peak emissions, we will see something in the overall concentration of greenhouse gasses. Right now, renewables are covering new energy demand, but not replacing fossil fuels.  Most important: skilled workforces that can support the energy transition across developing and developed countries. Technology is cheap and China is dominating the market. Developing countries can initially start with renewables from China, build their own economies, and then start to export energy. A faster track to transition is to provide the tools and goods needed to leapfrog to renewables. A lot of finance doesn’t go to developing countries for renewables due to investment risks. Building policy frameworks and financial resources that can support this will be vital. Elections matter, climate is a problem of leadership.  First is the issue of aerosols. They create a shield and cool the atmosphere, reflecting solar radiation while harming our health. The concentration of aerosols is getting lower in the atmosphere, helping our health but increasing warming. Second, immediately reduce methane emissions, these are 28-times more harmful than CO2 emissions. Third, tipping points; we are looking at the system in increments, but there could be elements changing completely. If Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets melt, it would increase sea level rise by ten or more meters in months. The role of the Amazon in capturing CO2 is changing. These tipping points are not well represented in WMO models, but these are big risks we need to address.   Roberta Boscolo is leading the Climate and Energy operations at the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. Her main work is to enhance the capacity of all countries to contrast climate change and enact sustainable development through scaling up science-based climate adaptation and mitigation measures in alignment with the global landmark agreements.

Powered mostly by dirty fossil fuels, Michigan’s big utilities would like to keep the status quo. However, an alternative energy model known as community solar has gained traction in other states like our neighbors in Ohio, Illinois and Minnesota. Community solar can provide a bridge to energy affordability and equity for low-income families, and it can play a big role in reducing energy costs.  Community solar offers a cost-effective solution for households, local businesses, farmers, schools and others with subscriptions to community solar programs. Subscribers receive energy from the program’s solar panels. Community solar opens up the benefits of solar power to people even if they rent, have old or shaded roofs or face financial barriers to the investment of installing solar panels on their property. Home energy is becoming increasingly unaffordable for low-income citizens, according to a recent report by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) and the Center for Energy Poverty, and Climate (CEPC).  The report found the financial burden of keeping cool this summer was expected to increase by 7.9% across the nation to an average of $719 from June through September, up from $661 during the same period last year.  At a time when nearly 3 out of 10 Americans have trouble paying their electric bills, community solar would provide essential relief during hot summers for low-income Michigan households. It serves as a vital resource, ensuring that all communities benefit from the transition to a clean energy economy by providing access to renewable, affordable and reliable electricity. Community solar bridges the gap to energy affordability by enabling low-income households to access community solar, which lowers their energy bills, providing more disposable income for essential needs, like food, clothing and prescriptions. A recent study by the Energy Markets & Policy group with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) confirms community solar is one of the best ways to increase equity in our energy system. The study found that community solar adopters typically earn significantly lower incomes and are more likely to rent and live in multifamily buildings compared to rooftop solar adopters in most states.  Notably, community solar subscribers are six times more likely to live in multifamily housing, four times more likely to rent, and earn 23% less than rooftop solar adopters. The greatest strength of community solar is its ability to reach populations living in multifamily and rental housing, where \"rooftop solar remains nearly inaccessible\" to these populations. While community solar presents a viable option for low-income families and other citizens, the Michigan Legislature needs to move forward and pass bipartisan community solar legislation.  HB 4839 and 4840, which I sponsored with  Rep. Jenn Hill of Marquette, are currently pending in the Michigan House. If passed, the bills would allow Michigan to join 22 other states in enabling residents to lower energy costs for low-income households, multi-family households and renters. The legislation would enable customers to subscribe to off-site solar facilities, paying a monthly rate of electricity generated by the project in exchange for offsets on their utility bills. Beyond the previously mentioned benefits, community solar is a critical tool for helping Michigan’s low income and multi-family households reduce their energy costs. Community solar subscribers would save an average of 10% on their utility bills. The legislation includes a provision that no less than 30% of the electricity produced by each solar installation be reserved for low-income households and organizations providing services for low-income residents.  Community solar needs to be a top legislative priority this fall to remove barriers preventing low-income and multi-family households from adopting solar programs.         Only donate if we've informed you about important Michigan issues  See what new members are saying about why they donated to Bridge Michigan:“In order for this information to be accurate and unbiased it must be underwritten by its readers, not by special interests.” - Larry S.“Not many other media sources report on the topics Bridge does.” - Susan B.“Your journalism is outstanding and rare these days.” - Mark S.If you want to ensure the future of nonpartisan, nonprofit Michigan journalism, please become a member today.

        "text": "(The Center Square) – The FBI has issued an official alert to the public about the potential for malicious cyber actors to disrupt power generation, steal intellectual property, or hold critical information for ransom within the U.S. renewable energy sector.  The warning comes as federal and local governments increasingly advocate for renewable energies, expanding the industry and creating more opportunities for cyber threats. According to the FBI, a 2019 incident underscored these risks when a private company lost visibility into approximately 500 megawatts of its wind and photovoltaic sites across California, Utah, and Wyoming due to a denial-of-service attack exploiting an unpatched firewall.  A denial-of-service attack is a cyber assault aimed at overwhelming a network, service, or server with excessive traffic to render it unavailable to legitimate users. “A cyber attack against a solar panel system—residential or commercial—would likely focus on targeting the system’s operational technology (OT) software and hardware,” the notification said. “Specifically, malicious cyber actors could attempt to gain control over a solar panel system through the inverters.” Some inverters have built-in monitoring systems connected to the internet, increasing their risk, the FBI said. A malicious actor gaining control of an inverter could potentially reduce power output or cause a home’s battery storage inverter to overheat. Historically, cyber attacks on residential solar infrastructure have been rare, but the growing adoption of renewable energy increases the risk. Other targets might include microgrids, local power systems that can operate independently during outages, or larger solar farms, according to the notification. The drive toward renewable energy has accelerated due to cost reductions and government incentives.  The Inflation Reduction Act signaled a federal push for renewable energy options across U.S. municipalities. By late 2023, renewable energy accounted for about 21% of U.S. electricity generation, prompting consumers to reduce fossil fuel consumption through new tax incentives. Federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, the largest energy consumer within the U.S. government, are increasingly sourcing energy from local electric grids. Local initiatives also reflect this trend, according to the notification. The Metropolitan Washington Council of Government aims to install 250,000 solar rooftops by 2030, according to the FBI.  Virginia set ambitious goals for its energy production, aiming to achieve 5,500 megawatts of wind and solar energy by 2028, powering 30% of its electric system with renewable energy by 2030, and ensuring 100% of its electricity comes from carbon-free sources by 2050. In response, researchers are developing passive sensor devices to detect unusual electrical activity and counter such threat. By detecting deviations from normal patterns or unexpected fluctuations in electrical activity, these sensors can effectively identify potential cyber intrusions or unauthorized access attempts targeting the system’s functionality.

Post Greg Alvarez is Energy Innovation’s Deputy Director of Communications, where he executes campaigns that showcase EI’s work in traditional and digital media.\n\nGreg has worked in climate and clean... During my six years in the wind industry, I often heard fear-based lies about proposed wind farms that defied common sense—wind turbines would cause nails to pop out of walls, turn cows’ milk sour, or decimate deer populations because bucks would catch their antlers in spinning turbine blades. On that last one, never mind wind turbine blades are a couple hundred feet off the ground. This was a nationwide phenomenon, something I heard in New York and California and half a dozen states in between like Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas. It’s no surprise none of these outlandish lies ever happened once American workers built the projects and communities were reinvesting revenue from those turbines back into their schools, roads, and emergency services. In fact, most the people I met had overwhelmingly positive feelings about the clean energy projects in their community. Public opinion data backs up what I heard: 90% of people living in close proximity to wind turbines prefer them to any other kind of central power plant, and positive national attitudes about wind improve over time as people choose to live near existing wind turbines. There’s no denying clean energy projects bring change to communities often accustomed to the status quo. But wild renewable energy rumors spread by the fossil fuel industry seem to run rampant across social media and internet forums. This disinformation is slowing the clean energy transition, imperiling efforts to fight climate change, and worsening public health. Economics don’t matter if you can’t site and build clean energy projects Today, wind and solar are the cheapest forms of new electricity. Contrary to popular belief, it’s cheaper to build new renewables than continue running many fossil fuel plants currently on the grid—for example, 99% of U.S. coal plants are uneconomic compared to replacing them with new local solar and wind. However, the places where we can build new wind and solar projects are rapidly shrinking, according to a new report from Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. Opposition to wind and solar projects such as challenges from organized groups, petitions, lawsuits, or public administrative proceeding increased 29% last year. Researchers found 395 restrictions, mostly at the city and county level, against building wind and solar projects in 2023, a 73% increase since 2022. Jacob Elkin, one of the report’s co-authors and a fellow for the Sabin Center’s Renewable Energy Legal Defense Initiative, sees the quick rise in measures to block wind and solar as indicative of a larger shift, telling E&E News opposition to renewables has “moved beyond ‘not in my back yard’ push back.” The numbers reflect impacts from all the new siting restrictions the Sabin Center identified—new wind installations are at their lowest levels in many years. Several factors are behind the slowdown, including high interest rates, grid congestion, and supply chain constraints, but heightened opposition is playing a big role. When I heard all the nefarious nuisances wind projects would supposedly cause, it was never clear if the person actually believed them, if they were simply trying to justify ideological opposition, or if they didn’t want to see the turbines. What is clear, however, is fossil fuel interests are helping spread these lies: - The Caesar Rodney Institute, a “think tank” that receives substantial fossil fuel funding, acts as the money manager for a number of anti-offshore wind groups. - Anonymously funded groups tied to the natural gas industry are funding opposition to solar projects in Ohio. - Coal producer Murray Energy has paid legal fees for residents fighting nearby renewable energy projects. - The Marketing Resource Group, a public relations firm with decades of experience representing pipeline companies in Michigan, is helping run a local anti-renewable energy organization in the state. And the list goes on. Misinformation is taking a particular toll on offshore wind growth, “where we see the highest correlation between misinformation and opposition,” said Matthew Eisenson of the Sabin Center. “There has been a concerted misinformation campaign to tie whale beaching’s to offshore wind development and exploration.” In reality, however, scientists find ship strikes and entanglements with fishing gear are behind the recent rise in East Coast whale deaths. Clean energy misinformation is costing us money and our health During my travels through wind country, I met dozens of people who told the economic success stories wind projects brought to their communities—with wind project revenue covering school budgets, lowering local taxes, and creating jobs that brought young people back to home to places with otherwise rapidly aging populations. And clean energy incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act are already spurring tens of thousands of new jobs and billions of dollars in investment. A generational economic opportunity is unfolding across America, and seeing communities lose out on investment dollars and good jobs because of misinformation often pushed by fossil fuel interests is frankly heartbreaking – and the costs are huge. One study puts the price of clean energy misinformation in Michigan alone at $210 million. “In all of these places in Michigan, there are good people who are working hard to do the best they can for their families, but they’ve been led to believe things that aren’t true,” said Ray Locker, executive director of the Checks and Balances Project. “We want to show the truth. The data show that wind energy helps communities by diversifying the economic base. That, in turn, helps landowners and farmers keep their properties and supports the infrastructure – schools, townships and more – around all residents.” And then there’s the costs our bodies and our children’s bodies pay from breathing toxic air from burning fossil fuels. Misinformation may only affect a specific community where a clean energy project is proposed, but air pollution doesn’t respect geographic lines. The more we learn about air pollution, the worse we realize it is for our health. Worldwide, 2,000 children a day die from air pollution, according to a new study from the Health Effects Institute, and air pollution is second only to malnutrition as a cause of deaths for children under five. Toxic air has also surpassed tobacco use globally to claim second place as the biggest risk factor for death, with high blood pressure presenting the worst risk. Fossil fuel power plants belch air pollution that can cause heart attacks, asthma attacks, strokes, and lost workdays. More than 8 million people worldwide died in 2018 alone from fossil fuel air pollution, and nearly one in five deaths worldwide in that year resulted from particulate matter tied to fossil fuel use. We shouldn’t tolerate energy sources that cause so much suffering when cleaner, cheaper alternatives are ready to take their place. The path forward We’re still learning how to inoculate against misinformation, but local and state governments can take several steps to stop its impact on the clean energy transition. Misinformation hotbed Michigan again offers an illustrative example, where a new law charges the Michigan Public Service Commission with permitting utility-scale wind, solar and, storage projects. Alternatively, localities can adopt standards set at the state level when permitting projects. These changes can help local officials charged with clean energy zoning decisions navigate processes they may know little about, and safeguard against misinformation pushed by ill-informed constituents or covert fossil fuel interests. We know how to combat the climate crisis—build as much clean energy as fast as we can and electrify all the things that currently burn fossil fuels, like cars, furnaces, and hot water heaters. For a long time, the technology wasn’t mature enough or costs were too high, but we’ve broken down those barriers. Now clean energy can fight climate change, invest millions in our communities, create good jobs, and help us breathe easier. We’ve come so far on the engineering side only to run into a problem of the human psyche. We should never accept being made poorer and sicker because of misinformation-filled Facebook memes—there’s too much at stake. The politicization of energy is such a shame, given how many clear wins can come from proper energy projects: economically, environmentally, public health, positive community outcomes, and more.  I wish I could say that disinformation with respect to renewables is limited to the US. Unfortunately, the disinformation merchants are thriving in Europe, especially for wind, both onshore and offshore. \n\t  Increased costs due to post-COVID supply chain caused inflation has negatively affected wind developers.  The recovery of momentum, especially for floating offshore wind, may be slow. But the longer term outlook is still positive.\n\n\tPlease continue your vital efforts to combat greenwashing and other forms of disinformation.  As you say, the stakes are high. If wind and solar are so cheap, why the continued subsidies? There is zero chance for controlling the planets’s climate by attempting to control CO2 levels. Basic mathematics and mass flow. Quite clear that green energy is being used by special interest groups to line their own pockets at the expense of the average citizen. Living in Kansas, I am not a big fan of stupefyingly huge structures cluttering the prairie, with most of the energy sent out of state. Offshore wind Is not helpful to the marine environment and that environment is extremely hard on the wind turbines. The machines off of Martha’s Island are all currently shutdown as a result of one of the machines self destructing and launching blade debris all over the nearby ocean. Seems to me, wind energy is real culprit behind hype. Wind energy can be useful, but the intermittent nature of wind has to be properly considered. The impact on the marine environment cannot be ignored. Energy from the machines needs to be reasonably priced and not propped up by the taxpayer.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nThe author, Greg Alvarez, shares his experiences with misinformation about wind farms, including outlandish claims about their impact on communities. Despite these myths, the majority of people living near wind turbines have positive feelings about them. However, fossil fuel interests are spreading disinformation about clean energy projects, slowing the transition to renewable energy. This misinformation is imperiling efforts to fight climate change and worsening public health. The cost of clean energy is now cheaper than building new fossil fuel plants, but opposition to wind and solar projects is increasing. According to a new report, 395 restrictions on building wind and solar projects were implemented in 2023, a 73% increase from the previous year. Fossil fuel interests are behind much of this opposition, spreading lies about wind projects. Misinformation is costing communities investment dollars and good jobs, with one study estimating the cost at $210 million in Michigan alone. The author argues that local and state governments can take steps to stop the impact of misinformation on the clean energy transition. The path forward involves building as much clean energy as fast as possible and electrifying fossil fuel-based infrastructure to combat climate change."

(Reuters)  Firefighters across the nation are alarmed at the prospect of battling blazes in buildings topped with solar panels, which can create new risks of roofs collapsing, an inability to gain footing and even potential electric shock. Two recent fires involving structures decked with solar panels have triggered complaints from fire chiefs and calls for new codes and regulations that reflect the dangers posed by the clean-energy devices. A two-alarm fire last week at a home in Piedmont, Calif., prompted Piedmont Fire Chief Warren McLaren to say the technology “absolutely” made it harder on firefighters. Weeks earlier, in Delanco, N.J., more than 7,000 solar panels on the roof of a massive 300,000-square foot warehouse factored into Delanco Fire Chief Ron Holt’s refusal to send his firefighters onto the roof of a Dietz & Watson facility. “We may very well not be able to save buildings that have alternative energy,” New Jersey’s Acting Fire Marshall William Kramer told The Star-Ledger. [pullquote] Experts told FoxNews.com that the biggest danger posed by the panels is that they continue to send voltage down from the roof throughout the building even after power is shut down. In a conventional building, firefighters typically cut off the electricity leading into the house before entering. “First of all, solar panels are designed to generate electricity any time there’s light received by the panels, and that happens in low-light settings as well,” said Ken Willette, a spokesman for the National Fire Protection Association. “So inherently, those are charged electrical appliances … there’s a shock hazard.” Solar panels also frequently utilize the very space firefighters use for rooftop ventilation during structure fires and create potentially dangerous conditions for slips and falls. “In some applications, the solar panels have covered 100 percent of the roof, which allows the firefighter no room to operate,” Willette continued. “That’s not what you want to have happen when you’re operating on a pitched roof.” With the panels rising in popularity, firefighters and building industry experts say codes must catch up. The average price of a solar panel has declined 60 percent since 2011 and industry trade groups expect that systems will be installed, on average, every four minutes in the United States by the end of 2013, primarily in California, Arizona, New Jersey and North Carolina. While the price of solar panels has dropped and their efficiency has increased, the U.S. still lags behind countries like Germany, Japan and Spain among solar panel installations. Swedish furniture giant IKEA also recently announced that it will begin selling residential solar panels at its stores in Britain, its first step to bring the renewable energy craze to the global mainstream market. A standard system will cost $9,200, including installation and an in-store consultation. John Smirnow, a spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, told FoxNews.com that the trade group, which represents more than 1,000 companies, is currently working with Cal Fire and the San Jose Fire Department to improve firefighter response to the systems. “Firefighter safety is a top priority; we take firefighter safety very seriously,” Smirnow said. “They need to know what they’re dealing with. It’s critically important that firefighters know the products.” A 2010 report by the Fire Protection Research Foundation found that slipping or tripping on solar panels were potential hazards for firefighters, as well as the possibility of the roof collapse due to the weight of the panels, which are generally made of crystalline silicon or thin-film semiconductor material. The maximum voltage of most systems, meanwhile, is roughly 600 volts, which can cause shock or burns. “The industry has to continue to work with the fire service community, both on education and updating building codes to meet firefighters’ needs,” Smirnow continued. “That’s really where I think we can make the most progress.” Smirnow said solar panels have only factored into a \"handful\" of fires to date and added that the trade group is now in discussions with national safety groups to conduct training sessions with emergency responders across the country. “We need to understand what’s best for the fire service community,” he told FoxNews.com. \"What type of education do they need? Then we’ll work with them to make that happen.” The hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.

        "category": "renewable",
        "id": 98,
        "rating": "-",
        "text": "From the end of Dina Smith’s driveway, there is green as far as the eye can see. Sunlight touches the rolling hills and moorland peaks. \"Just look at it,\" she says as we take it all in. \"This is beautiful, untouched Mid Wales.\" But this could all change if plans for a huge wind turbine project get the go-ahead. For Dina, the valley is a \"really special place\", where she, her daughters and their families live and where her grandfather grew up. In the run-up to the general election, she contacted the BBC through the Your Voice, Your Vote portal with her concerns. \"I just don’t want my grandchildren looking around this valley with industrial views of turbines and pylons and roads, and ask: 'What did you do about it Nanna?'\" she said. The Towy Usk project is being proposed by the renewable energy firm Green GEN Cymru and would take power from 31 giant turbines on a 60-mile pylon \"pathway\" spanning almost the width of Wales, in order to connect to the national grid. Although it is the local council and Welsh government who grant planning permission, the reason the power lines have to run such a long way is that there are a limited number of points, which are controlled by the UK government, where big power projects can connect into the grid. And whoever is in charge of the next government has an incredibly difficult task on their hands: keeping energy bills low while millions are still struggling, ensuring energy security and hitting green energy targets. Projects like this one in Wales are part of that mix. But some local residents I have been speaking to have said the turbine construction would damage an existing forest, removing ancient trees along the pylon construction route.  \"It’s destroying the environment in an attempt to save the environment\" is the refrain that I keep hearing. In recent years, there have been huge advances in the development of offshore wind, and residents here want the focus of the UK and Welsh governments on offshore renewable technology instead.  But Abi Beck of RenewableUK Cymru says onshore wind needs to remain part of the mix. “Onshore wind is the cheapest, it’s the quickest to build and it’s the most readily deployable technology we have for renewable energy. \"And we desperately need to upscale the amount of renewable energy we produce if we are going to be anywhere near meeting our targets in the next decade,\" she says. The difficulty here is that the place the onshore wind is generated is a very long way from the place it can be plugged into the UK network. Green GEN Cymru says it is listening to residents' concerns but that “the existing network in Mid and West Wales does not have nearly enough capacity to connect all the new renewable energy we need for our homes and businesses, locally and nationally\". Llandovery farmer Dyfan Walters knows that only too well. \"We all know the infrastructure needs improving,\" he says. \"I’m not against renewable energy.\" He and his wife, Carys, have just finished building their family farm on the land  Carys grew up on. Now there are plans for two pylons in their fields so they’ve become members of the local Llandovery Pylon Steering Group. \"This plan isn’t going to benefit anyone here in the Towy Valley,\" Dyfan says. \"It’s to take energy to the grid which will be used by others.\" As a result, Dyfan thinks Green GEN should use the latest technology to send the wires underground rather than use pylons, whatever the cost might be to the company. That is the bind - those living in the valley feel they are being made to pay the price for green targets made more than 200 miles away in Westminster. Labour says it will work with the private sector to double onshore wind, triple solar power and quadruple offshore wind by 2030. The Conservative Party says in its manifesto that it will \"ensure democratic consent for onshore wind\" and strike the right balance between energy security and the views of local communities. It says it seeks to ensure local areas that host onshore wind directly benefit, including potentially through energy bill discounts. The Liberal Democrats say they will accelerate the deployment of renewable power and deliver energy security by removing restrictions on new solar and wind power. Plaid Cymru says Wales should have full control over energy powers without any upper limit or conditions set by the UK government, and \"that the beauty of Wales’ natural landscape should be preserved\". It says that large-scale pylon developments or solar developments should be considered in the context of their impact and alternative methods for linking renewable energy to the national grid should be implemented, including through the undergrounding of cables. Reform says that net zero is pushing up bills, damaging British industries like steel and making the UK less secure. It says the environment can be protected with more tree planting, more recycling and using less single-use plastics. The Green Party wants wind power to provide about 70% of the UK’s electricity by 2030.  The SNP says it is committed to ensuring that at least 50% of energy consumption comes from renewable sources by 2030 \"by striking a balance between appropriate developments and our natural environment\". The floating wind turbines will be constructed at a new deep water terminal in Avonmouth. Neart na Gaoithe wind farm off the coast of Fife is expected to be completed by next summer. In Iceland scientists plan to drill down to magma to understand it and use it for energy production. In his first visit to the north east since taking office, the minister vowed support for North Sea workers. Plans to build five 180m high wind turbines are given the go-ahead by the Welsh government.

Hawaiian Electric was aware of infrastructure issues that could contribute to a wildfire threat but focused on shifting the company toward renewable energy rather than fixing problems, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday. The utility company concluded in 2019 that it needed to invest more in preventing its power lines from emitting sparks, among other issues. Consulting California's efforts to reduce wildfires, the company drafted a plan to install more insulated conductors, fire-retardant poles and more aggressive monitoring technology. The company barely pursued those goals over the next two years, however, investing less than $250,000 on wildfire projects, according to the Journal. It did not request state permission to raise rates to pay for wildfire prevention until 2022. Instead, the company found itself focused on a state-mandated shift toward renewable energy.

        "text": "Last week, Pakistan witnessed a significant milestone in its energy transition as the Chinese electric vehicle (EV) giant BYD launched its brand of electric vehicles in the country. This event signals a shift in Pakistan’s transportation landscape and serves as a reminder of the broader global movement towards cleaner energy solutions.  The event is more than just a business story; it reflects the urgent need to replace fossil fuels as source of energy with sustainable alternatives.  Energy lies at the core of the climate crisis. Our current reliance on fossil fuels—coal, oil, and gas—is driving the planet’s temperature to dangerous levels. The challenge of replacing these energy sources with cleaner alternatives is the greatest task humanity has ever faced. For most of history, humans relied on wood as their primary energy source. It wasn’t until the 18th century that we began burning fossil fuels in significant quantities. This shift, which began in England, powered the Industrial Revolution. The immediate effects were evident—cities choked with smoke, leading to millions of deaths annually from air pollution. However, the more insidious problem lay with the invisible carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. When we burn fossil fuels, we release vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. For instance, burning a gallon of gasoline produces about 22 pounds of CO2. This gas traps heat that would otherwise escape into space, initiating a warming process that has now brought the concentration of CO2 in our atmosphere from 275 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial Revolution to about 420 ppm today.  In the mid-20th century, scientists began developing solar panels, initially for use in space. At first, these panels were prohibitively expensive, but over time, their costs have dropped dramatically. Similarly, wind power has become more affordable as engineers have built larger, more efficient turbines. Battery technology is also improving, making it easier to store energy for times when the sun isn’t shining, or the wind isn’t blowing. This is in stark contrast to fossil fuels, which become more expensive as easily accessible deposits are depleted. Where oil drillers once struck “gushers,” they now have to extract oil from deep beneath the ocean or from tar sands, a costly and environmentally damaging process. Today, renewable energy is often the cheapest source of power available, even before considering the immense economic cost of climate change. Despite the advantages of renewable energy, the transition away from fossil fuels is happening too slowly. One reason is inertia. Our global infrastructure is built around fossil fuels. There are over 1.4 billion vehicles on the world’s roads, most of them running on gasoline or diesel. The network of refineries, pipelines, and gas stations that keep these vehicles running is vast and entrenched. Electric vehicles (EVs) offer a promising alternative. They are quieter, have fewer moving parts, and are often superior to their gasoline-powered counterparts. Yet, it could take decades for gas cars to disappear entirely, we don’t but we are not left with that much time if we are to address climate change effectively. And while governments are beginning to promote EVs and subsidize their purchase, more concerted action is needed to phase out fossil-fuel-powered cars and other transporting infrastructure. Inertia, however, isn’t the biggest obstacle. The most significant barrier to change comes from vested interests. Fossil fuel companies and the nations that depend on them for revenue have a lot to lose if the world transitions to renewable energy too quickly. For them, the shift to renewables is a disaster because it could strand their remaining stocks of hydrocarbons—oil, gas, and coal—rendering them worthless. These vested interests wield enormous power. ExxonMobil was once the world’s largest company, and nations like Russia and Saudi Arabia derive most of their wealth and influence from fossil fuels. In the United States, the Koch brothers, major oil and gas barons, have been the biggest political donors in history. This influence has allowed the fossil fuel industry to delay action on climate change for decades. As far back as the 1970s, oil companies like ExxonMobil knew about the dangers of global warming. Their scientists accurately predicted the rise in temperatures we’re seeing today, and company executives believed them—so much so that they started building drilling rigs higher to account for rising sea levels. Yet, instead of warning the public, the industry hired public relations experts to cast doubt on the science of climate change, a strategy that delayed meaningful action for nearly 30 years. Despite these efforts, the tide is beginning to turn. A growing citizens’ movement has pushed institutions to divest from fossil fuels, making it harder for these companies to raise capital. Activists are blocking pipelines and coal terminals, slowing the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure. The shift to renewable energy won’t be without challenges. Mining the minerals needed for solar panels and batteries comes with its own environmental costs, and there will be debates over the aesthetics of wind turbines. However, renewable energy offers a more democratic energy future.  Sun and wind are available everywhere, unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a few places, often giving undue power to those who control them. For the nearly billion people who still lack access to modern energy, renewable sources offer a cheaper, faster solution than traditional fossil fuel infrastructure. The idea that we can produce energy by simply pointing a sheet of glass at the sun is nothing short of miraculous. In rural areas, such as parts of Sindh, people are experiencing the benefits of this new technology—refrigeration for the first time, light for evening study, and more. This technology, if deployed widely and quickly, could help slow global warming and give humanity a fighting chance. We stand at a critical moment in history, one where we must stop burning things on Earth and instead rely on the energy from the sun. This is our best hope for a sustainable future. As the launch of BYD’s electric vehicles in Pakistan demonstrates, the technology for a cleaner, greener future is already here.  It represents not just an advancement in transportation but a beacon of hope in our battle against climate change.

This marks a shift in Pakistan's transportation landscape and is part of a global movement towards cleaner energy solutions. The need to replace fossil fuels with sustainable alternatives is urgent due to the climate crisis. Fossil fuels are driving the planet's temperature to dangerous levels, and replacing them with cleaner alternatives is the greatest task humanity has ever faced. The Industrial Revolution was powered by fossil fuels, which have led to air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions. Renewable energy sources like solar and wind power are becoming increasingly affordable and are now often the cheapest source of power available. Despite the advantages of renewable energy, the transition away from fossil fuels is happening too slowly due to inertia and vested interests. Fossil fuel companies and nations that rely on them for revenue are resisting the shift to renewables, which could strand their remaining stocks of hydrocarbons. The tide is beginning to turn, however, with a growing citizens' movement pushing for divestment from fossil fuels and a shift to renewable energy. The launch of BYD's electric vehicles in Pakistan demonstrates that the technology for a cleaner, greener future is already here, and embracing it is key to mitigating the climate crisis."

Continuing to require the use of these green energy products will cede economic power to China, giving China control of American energy security. Only by using its own oil and natural gas resources and passing prudent trade, tax, and regulatory policy can America remain strong and energy-independent. Select a Section  1/0   This Special Report documents how costly green policies will make America dependent on China and harm American energy, economic, and national security. The U.S. is currently one of the largest energy producers in the world, which should be a significant advantage over China, which is the world’s largest energy importer. But China is trying to turn the tables by dominating the green energy infrastructure mandated by American politicians—an infrastructure to which the American Left is addicted. The goals of American energy policy should be crystal clear: Under Chinese law, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) exerts influence over major Chinese enterprises, including by forcing the transfer of any information related to “national security.”REF Nevertheless, under policies being adopted by the Biden–Harris Administration, the United States is drifting perilously close to dependence on CCP-controlled supply chains that are essential for any “green energy” transition. Recent U.S. government mandates requiring electrificationREF and a switch from domestic legacy fuels to wind and solar powerREF further exacerbate this dependence, aligning perfectly with CCP objectives outlined in China’s Made in China 2025 campaign.REF If continued, the Biden–Harris Administration’s extreme and progressive climate and energy policies will handcuff America to China’s critical minerals, electronic components, and green energy industries, thereby dangerously undermining U.S. national security. The imposition of mandatory electrification will weaken America’s economy and disproportionately hurt lower-income Americans by raising energy and transportation costs.REF This Special Report, the third paper in The Heritage Foundation’s Chinese Handcuffs series,REF analyzes China’s predatory trade practices, unyielding cyber aggression, and advantages in supplies of critical minerals and renewable supply chains. It suggests that four more years of the Left’s green energy policies will indebt the nation through subsidies and high energy costs while reducing global temperatures only by a fraction of a degree by 2100.REF China’s Accession to the WTO. China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 had countless unforeseen negative consequences. Western leaders believed that Chinese participation would catalyze comprehensive economic reforms and adherence to international trade standards in the growing Asian power.REF Not only did this not happen, but Chinese subsidies undercut prices in Western countries. This benefited Western consumers, who took advantage of inexpensive imports, but harmed Western producers, who lost market share. While inaccurately characterized as a developing nation,REF China has fortified its authoritarian economy, propping up green industries with massive subsidies through government guidance funds (GGFs) and state-owned enterprises. According to a 2023 Congressional Research Service brief, the CCP has channeled money into 1,800 GGFs for domestic research and development (R&D) and overseas acquisitions. These GGFs are investment vehicles that have attracted $627 billion in private capital and have a capital target amount of $1.5 trillion.REF The system is carefully orchestrated to raise the short-term profits of foreign companies that want access to China’s substantial domestic market, and this has led to a long-term loss of U.S. jobs and rampant intellectual property (IP) theft. The deep-rooted problems arising from China’s premature WTO entry are clear. The organization's framework and dispute settlement mechanisms have frustrated America’s attempts to rein in China’s non-compliant trade practices.REF This failure not only has eroded the integrity of what had been a rules-based global trading system, but also has disadvantaged countless other nations. Despite commitments that it made during the WTO accession process, China has repeatedly fallen short in enforcing IP protection. This has resulted in thefts of trade secrets from Western countries and forced technology transfers that in turn have reduced returns for foreign companies operating in China and undermined the foundational principles of free trade. Forced Technology Transfers and Cyber Espionage. Forced technology transfers are a stark reality for foreign companies operating in China, threatening intellectual property rights and true free-market comparative advantages. Under the guise of joint venture requirements, foreign enterprises find themselves compelled to partner with Chinese firms as a precondition for market entry.REF These partnerships often come with the expectation that critical technologies and trade secrets will be shared. On other occasions, intellectual property is stolen by agents operating inside China.REF Ultimately, many companies have parted with key technology and intellectual property, jeopardizing their long-term growth prospects in exchange for a temporary opportunity to profit by selling in China’s billion-person market.REF Intellectual property theft enables Chinese firms to use stolen information to enhance their competitiveness, often against the very companies that provided the information. This theft is inherent in China’s approach to foreign business engagement. Some estimates suggest that China steals between $225 billion and $600 billion worth of goods and IP every year from the United States.REF Since the President of the Supreme People's Court has expressly written that Chinese courts should first serve Chinese Communist Party and industrial policy goals, this lack of the rule of law jeopardizes IP protection and enforcement for all foreign rights holders in China.REF Additionally, China has been identified in the 2023 Annual Threat Assessment from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence as “represent[ing] the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to U.S. Government and private-sector networks.”REF Thousands of hacking efforts by China occur every day. The CCP-established Unit 61398 of the People’s Liberation Army is known to U.S. cyber experts as Advanced Persistence Threat 1 (APT1). It is the branch of the Chinese military that is responsible for infiltrating industrial control systems of America’s critical industries and engaging in cyberattacks abroad.REF Nearly 80 percent of organizations using supervisory control and data acquisition or industrial control systems have reported security breaches in the past two years.REF Inverter-based resources such as solar and wind pose a unique threat because of their poor cybersecurity and remote and unprotected nature.REF The CCP has recently created a specialized hacking group called Volt Typhoon that has infiltrated critical infrastructure across the United States according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).REF Volt Typhoon’s penetration of the industrial control systems of key sectors, including communications, energy, and water, is alarming and could potentially overheat data servers, disrupt control systems, and manipulate surveillance cameras, posing grave risks to essential services.REF Moody's has reclassified these critical infrastructure assets as “credit negative” due to the systematic cyber risks from state and non-state actors.REF Chinese vs. American Green Subsidies. The CCP uses government subsidies to control industrial development. In a 2022 study, the Center for Strategic and International Studies conservatively estimated that China spent about $400 billion (adjusted by purchasing power parity) on industrial policy support in 2019.REF Bloomberg estimates that in 2022, Chinese investment accounted for $546 billion of the global $1.1 trillion in green energy spending.REF This is not an investment as America would understand it: It is a concerted campaign to corner the market in green infrastructure. For comparison, America spent $141 billion in direct government subsidies for solar, wind, electric vehicle (EV), and advanced energy manufacturing in addition to $360 billion in U.S. private investment in green technologies during the Biden–Harris Administration. In other words, China spent more in a single year—2022—than America has spent over the past four years on green energy in addition to its decades of previous expenditures through government guidance funds. The so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) championed by the Biden–Harris AdministrationREF has also extended and expanded U.S. government subsidies that it is estimated will cost $359 billion between 2025 and 2028. Even if the IRA spending is retained, however, the CCP will still spend more than the United States spends on green energy subsidies. Chart 1 illustrates the $495 billion in U.S. “green energy” subsidies that it is projected will have been spent under current law during the Biden–Harris Administration and the coming four years.      The Department of the Treasury projects that spending related to clean-emission vehicles will total $125 billion between 2025 and 2028. This includes a credit of up to $7,500 for new electric or fuel cell vehicles purchased in 2023. During the same period, it is estimated that $79 billion and $72 billion, respectively, will be spent on advanced energy manufacturing production and energy production tax credits, which provide tax benefits based on the production of items like batteries and renewable electricity, and that $20 billion and $63 billion, respectively, will be spent on advanced energy manufacturing investment and energy investment tax credits, which allow for a maximum 30 percent write-off for creating renewable power plants or factories producing specified green or transmission products. China’s Manipulation of the Critical Minerals Market.REF The U.S. Geological Survey lists 50 critical minerals that are “essential to the economic or national security of the United States, have a supply chain that is vulnerable to disruption, and serve an essential function in the manufacturing of a product, the absence of which would have significant consequences for the economic or national security of the United States.”REF Among these critical minerals are the rare earth elements that are largely contained in the Lanthanide series of elements. These elements are considered rare because of how diffuse they are within the Earth’s crust, which makes mining for a specific ore particularly challenging. These materials are essential in various high-tech applications such as metallurgy, batteries, catalysts, lasers, medical imaging, and electronic components. The favored position of Chinese industries depends on controlling the supply chains of these critical minerals and rare earth elements. Chart 2 lists 13 critical minerals and shows Chinese control of their production, particularly gallium, refined magnesium, and tungsten production. China dominates this sector and controls:      According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), if the projected green transition were to occur, the world would require a threefold to sevenfold increase in the global production of rare earth elements by 2040.REF Under current market structure, by far the largest portion of this increase would be controlled by China. Permanent magnets account for 38 percent of the rare earth element market, the catalyst industry accounts for 23 percent, and alloys for batteries and metallurgy account for 17 percent. The largest category of magnets—the high-powered rare earth magnets (often a combination of neodymium, iron, and boron)—are used in 76 percent of offshore and 32 percent of land-based wind turbines.REF This technology structure has tied necessary inputs to the wind industry directly to the CCP. Additionally, the IEA expects a fortyfold increase in the demand for lithium by 2040 as part of the green transition.REF China today produces around half of the lithium carbonate needed by global industry, and the CCP is purchasing large stakes in lithium mines in African countries such as Zimbabwe.REF According to the Griffith Asia Institute at Australia’s Griffith University, the CCP’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) increased its “engagement” in technology, such as batteries, EVs, car parts, and telecommunications manufacturing, by 1,046 percent and its “engagement” in mining and metal refining by 158 percent between 2022 and 2023.REF For example, the BRI has been investing in lithium mines in Mali, lithium processing in Zimbabwe, copper processing in Saudi Arabia, nickel mines and solar cell factories in Indonesia, and EV factories in Thailand. These expenditures by GGFs and Chinese industry not only provide inputs to China’s domestic supply chains, but also provide resources for the Biden–Harris Administration’s green energy projects. By contrast, similar projects in the United States take more time to acquire permits and finish the required environmental impact statements. For example, new American mines take an average of 16.5 years to move from discovery to development, even though the actual construction takes only five years of that time, according to the IEA.REF China has recently banned exports of graphite, gallium, and germanium as well as technologies used in rare earth extraction and separation.REF The CCP may be pulling ahead in a number of sectors, such as solvent extraction technology for rare earth elements, which will increase its capacity for large-scale rare earth element extraction.REF If these technological advances come to fruition, China will gain a strategic advantage in refining future critical mineral deposits. Access to Critical Minerals Blocked by the Biden–Harris Administration. Unfortunately, the Biden–Harris Administration has held up several critical minerals projects in the United States because of Environmental Protection Agency rules and regulations. The blocking of copper and nickel mining is likely illegal now that the Supreme Court has rolled back agency actions that depart from written statutes,REF and such illegality is especially troubling when one considers that the Biden Department of Energy’s July 2023 Critical Minerals Assessment characterizes these two minerals as critical to electrification in the medium term.REF The Biden–Harris Administration has restricted access to critical minerals in the United States, most recently by blocking the Ambler Road Copper Mine in Alaska.REF The following projects were blocked in 2023:      Chart 3 shows that both applications to mine and approvals to mine declined substantially during the Administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. In 2011, companies submitted 72 applications for mines to the Bureau of Land Management, which approved 37. By 2015, applications had declined to 33 and approvals to 22. Applications rose to more than 40 during the Trump Administration, but by 2022, applications were at 14 and approvals at six. The only bright spot for domestic mining in recent years has been the restarting of the rare earth Mountain Pass Mine in California that was shut down in 2002.REF Today, that mine produces about 15 percent of global rare earths but ships most of the ores to China for processing because of a lack of the necessary infrastructure in the United States.REF The story of China’s rising dominance in EVs is inseparable from the success of China’s battery industry because batteries make up around a third of the cost of EVs.REF Chart 4 shows that China produced 85 percent of the world’s electric batteries in 2023, and Chart 5 shows that production of the EV battery components is dominated by China. A lithium-based battery’s cathode needs such minerals as phosphorous, cobalt, manganese, or nickel, and the anode needs either natural or synthetic graphite. China controls 82 percent of the world’s mining of the natural graphite used in these battery anodes.REF In addition, copper is increasingly vital to the manufacturing of electric batteries, and China controlled “more than 44 percent of global refined copper production” in 2023.REF Since EVs contain four times more copper than is required for gasoline-powered automobiles,REF this refined copper production is largely going to the production of EVs. An International Energy Forum study by Cornell University Professor Emeritus Lawrence Cathles and University of Michigan Professor Adam Simon concludes that “[t]o electrify the global vehicle fleet requires bringing into production 55% more new mines than would otherwise be needed.”REF China controls 72 percent of lithium refining, 53 percent of phosphate refining, and 68 percent of cobalt refining capacity.REF These critical rare earth elements are also necessary for producing cathodes in batteries. The CCP has given the Chinese battery company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the largest such company in the world, funding to control 25 percent of the cobalt reserves in the Republic of Congo in Africa, where forced labor and child labor are used in the mining of cobalt for batteries.REF         Chart 6 shows that China produces 66 percent of EVs, while Europe produces 22 percent and the United States produces only 10 percent. The Chinese Communist Party has subsidized its domestic EV market by $28 billion between 2009 and 2020 and plans to spend another $72 billion between 2023 and 2026.REF These subsidies include sales tax exemptions, R&D grants, and infrastructure subsidies. Many Chinese companies were incentivized to enter the battery industry because of these subsidies. Although a number of these companies failed, the creation of the first Tesla gigafactory in China gave others access to the Chinese-dominated supply chains that would be needed to make companies internationally competitive. In addition to subsidizing EVs, the CCP penalized the use of gasoline-powered vehicles. Chinese cities required owners of vehicles with internal combustion engines to bid tens of thousands of dollars for license plates and to drive only on certain days of the week.REF In contrast, owners of EVs generally get free license plates, can drive at any time, and are tax exempt.REF By spurring domestic EV growth, China ensures that its domestic auto market will shift to EVs. This builds up domestic manufacturing, which results in economies of scale.      Moreover, China is building an ecosystem of technology around its batteries and charging stations for EVs. As has taken place in the past, China may be trying to use the technology to steal data from foreigners visiting areas domestically and abroad such as military bases, industrial sites, and government facilities by gathering data from the vehicles that use its charging stations.REF For example, batteries produced by CATL, a recipient of CCP government guidance funds, were installed as backups to a solar array close to Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, home to the Marine Corps Special Operations Command. The base was forced to remove these batteries after Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL) and two dozen other Republican lawmakers sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin demanding an investigation.REF The Senators were concerned that passive sensor technology in batteries could send data back to China and reveal the base’s energy demands during military exercises.REF According to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, CATL has ties to Beijing’s United Front Work Department.REF The department runs the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce overseas trade group, whose vice chairman, Zeng Yuquan, is the company’s largest shareholder.REF Such a deeply intertwined relationship indicates clearly that companies such as CATL are not only corporate entities, but also instruments of state policy and intelligence gathering. At a minimum, these ties between the CCP and Chinese EV and battery companies call into question the wisdom of allowing imports of these vehicles into the United States. Coal-Powered Renewables that Won’t Stop Climate Change. In their pursuit of an absolutist climate agenda, climate alarmists have ignored the threat posed by China’s dominance of the production of renewable components. They have ignored China’s abysmal environmental record and economic manipulation, advocated for U.S. subsidies for renewables, and restricted the development of mines within America. At the same time, U.S. companies are purchasing solar panels made with slave labor in China and driving Chinese electric vehicles with components that are produced using coal-fired power plants. In 2022, China permitted, on average, two coal-fired power plants a week, partly to supply power to battery and solar component factories.REF China also produces 2,000 tons of toxic waste for every ton of rare earths elements extracted.REF The environmentally destructive ways China has extracted critical minerals have contributed to China’s loss of forested land. From 2000 to 2023, China lost 7.4 percent of its tree cover, and from 2002 to 2023, it lost 4.7 percent of its primary forest.REF The Lowy Institute estimates that due to industrial activity, 80 percent to 90 percent of the groundwater is no longer suitable for drinking, and almost 50 percent of aquifers contain water that is not fit for farming or industry.REF The federal government’s Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change shows that complete elimination of American carbon emissions would reduce global temperatures by only two-tenths of one degree Celsius by 2100.REF This is because Asia, Africa, and Latin America are not reducing their emissions. China produces more than 30 percent of the world’s annual greenhouse gases; America accounts for only 14 percent.REF China, along with the rest of the world, has rapidly been adding to global CO2 emissions; U.S. emissions have declined by 1,000 million metric tons in the past 15 years, largely due to the replacement of coal power plants by combined-cycle natural gas plants.REF According to Chart 7, China’s CO2 emissions nearly doubled those of the U.S. in 2022.      Even if Western countries decided not to import renewable energy, China plans to deploy four times more renewable energy capacity than the European Union (EU) and five times more than America from 2023–2028.REF China claims that by 2030, “almost half” of its energy will be produced by renewables,REF but China has a record of broken promises. In 2023, for example, CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping announced that China’s carbon emissions would no longer peak in 2030 as China had previously promised when it signed onto the Paris Agreement.REF Solar: An Industry Exploiting Forced Labor. There are often challenges to connecting solar arrays to electrical grids because of the difficulties of transmission. In order to make solar more attractive, China has subsidized solar investments by approximately 50 percent to 70 percent.REF America has tried to match Chinese solar investment with a 30 percent tax credit.REF From 2014–2021 (the years for which the most recent data are available), the Chinese government provided almost $50 billion in subsidies to solar projects. This expenditure weakened the Chinese economy but allowed Chinese manufacturers to capture over 70 percent of the global market share.REF      China currently dominates the solar supply chain. The International Energy Agency concluded in 2022 that “China’s share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels (such as polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells and modules) exceeds 80%. This is more than double China’s share of global PV demand.”REF However, China uses forced labor to manufacture potentially 79 percent of polysilicon, 97 percent of wafers, 75 percent of modules, and 85 percent of solar cells used in the solar industry.REF This reduction in cost has allowed China to dominate the industry, as shown in Chart 8. The United Nations,REF the EU,REF the U.S. Department of Labor,REF and the U.S. Department of State have published reports about the use of forced labor in industries that are tied to renewable energy supply chains.REF The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that more than a million minorities, chiefly Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and Kyrgyz—defined by China as “surplus labour” according to the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human RightsREF—have been subjected to mass detention, pervasive surveillance, and forced labor.REF In its bid to dominate solar panel production, China has forced these “surplus” workers to labor in four of the world’s five largest polysilicon factories and in coal-fired power plants.REF This exploitation is one reason why China’s share of global polysilicon production rose from 62 percent in 2016 to 83 percent in 2022. America’s share declined from 35 percent to 5 percent over the same period.REF Not only have buyers of solar panels been indirectly funding companies that use slave labor, but American taxpayers have also subsidized almost $37 billion in purchases between 2016 and 2022.REF The U.S. Department of Energy has calculated that without components sourced from forced labor in China, the cost of solar components could rise by 30 percent to 40 percent.REF In 2021, in response to these labor practices, Congress passed a law signed by President Biden, popularly known as the Uighur Forced Labor Act, which prohibited imports of solar components made with slave labor.REF However, the U.S. Department of Commerce reported that China was shipping solar components made with forced labor to Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam, where they would be assembled and then sent to America as the products of these countries to avoid the import prohibition.REF Collectively, these three countries plus Malaysia, which is not engaging in the practice, now account for 80 percent of U.S. panel supplies.REF Trina Solar, which used Solar World’s technology in PERC solar cells, was found to be operating in Thailand. Transmission and Wind: Further Dependence on China. With more than 1,080 gigawatts (GWs) of solar and 366 GWs of wind waiting to connect in 2023, the U.S. had a significant backlog of subsidized renewable projects, often permitted to build in remote areas where land is plentiful.REF However, construction in such locations necessitates a large build-out in expensive transmission infrastructure. These projects often take decades to complete and are highly dependent on large, globe-spanning supply chains. For example, 82 percent of large power transformers come from abroad, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.REF Additionally, the Department of Energy found that the Asia-Pacific region accounts for 39 percent of market share by revenue.REF These large power transformers are used mostly by the wind industry to transmit electricity from rural areas to urban centers.      Chart 9 shows that China has a 66 percent market share in the global wind turbine market. With such a high market share, China holds a dominant position in the wind industry. Since 76 percent of offshore and 32 percent of land-based wind turbines use rare earth permanent magnets, China’s dominance in rare earths has also contributed to its disproportionate control of the wind industry.REF The forced transition to renewable energy and electrified transportation is weakening America and helping China. The obvious solution is for America to remove requirements and subsidies to use these technologies and instead let individuals, companies, and utilities decide on their preferred technologies. A level playing field would get rid of many of the problems described in this Special Report. Regardless of whether or not America’s leadership continues with a forced transition to electric and renewable technology, federal and state politicians should allow, not block, domestic development of the critical minerals required for U.S. production. The current policy of requiring wind, solar, and electrification of vehicles and appliances while banning production of their essential inputs leaves America dependent on China. China has created a cost advantage in producing renewables, batteries, and electric vehicles. The government of China has a stake in every major Chinese company and artificially sets prices and production targets. Chinese wage rates are disproportionately low due to forced labor. The cost of energy is lower because the CCP has not implemented many of the clean air requirements implemented in America and Europe. Xi Jinping has specifically abandoned his former pledge to peak Chinese emissions in 2030 and then reduce them thereafter. The cost of capital is lower because the CCP awards loans at favored rates to important companies. And this is just the tip of the iceberg, as the CCP subsidizes these companies in numerous other ways. In addition to its cost advantage, China has made strategic purchases of foreign assets in order to develop its portfolio of critical minerals. The combination of cost advantage and access to critical minerals enables China to dominate global markets. China is not forcing America to purchase its products, but America is making itself dependent on China by choosing to use federal and state regulations to require that the United States and individual states use renewable energy and electric vehicles. This reduces jobs for American workers and increases jobs for Chinese workers. It slows U.S. economic growth because green energy is more expensive than oil, gas, coal, and nuclear. It sacrifices American national security interests because China is not an American ally, and it is therefore unwise to depend on China for a vital section of the American economy. Below are a series of steps that would allow America to free itself from its Chinese handcuffs, abandon mandates that encourage the use of Chinese products, and make use of America’s own domestic resources of oil and natural gas, as well as radionuclides. By leveraging mechanisms within the WTO, stealing or co-opting IP from foreign companies, and buying out foreign companies with government guidance funds, China has succeeded in dominating the world’s supply chains in green energy products and components. If America continues to require the use of these green energy products, it will cede economic power to China, giving China control of American energy security. America is making itself weaker and China stronger by passing a set of laws and enacting regulations that benefit an adversary. Only by abandoning green energy and vehicle mandates and subsidies, making use of its own domestic oil and natural gas resources, and passing prudent trade, tax, and regulatory policy will America continue to be strong and energy-independent.

Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire, says his Hermon facility uses up to 55,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month and that the rising cost of electricity is causing him to increase prices on his retread tires. He says he has lost customers to retread facilities in New Hampshire, which has lower energy costs and no sales tax.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  Manufacturers in Maine are pushing back against electricity costs that rose sharply this summer as a result of state policy meant to encourage the use of solar and wind power. The Public Utilities Commission is again looking into how much of a power bill should be used to incentivize renewable energy projects. Manufacturers, policymakers, utilities and others agree that Maine must add more solar and wind energy to reach targets for reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Disagreements focus on how to apportion the cost. The recent change in how rates are calculated has particularly angered large consumers of electricity. Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire Inc. – a significant energy user that retreads more than 34,000 truck tires a year – said his electricity bill is up $10,000 a year at his Hermon site, adding to the $15,000 a month he’s already paying for 50,000 to 55,000 kilowatt-hours each month, depending on production. “That’s $10,000 going out the door, for what?” he said. “I just don’t understand.” Maine Commercial Tire, which has been in business for 34 years, faces competitors who do business in low-tax states such as New Hampshire, Lynch said. He was one of several business owners who complained to regulators about the steep increase.Advertisement Milo Chip, a paper products manufacturer that employs four workers, told the PUC its monthly bill is up by $6,000. That brings the full monthly electric bill to more than $10,000, office manager Isabelle McKenna said, adding the business may be forced to close in the near future. A hardwood and softwood pulp inventory should provide a few weeks of chipping, she said. The company has been in business for 12 years. “It is so horrible,” she said. “It’s not sustainable.” HOW WE GOT HERE  State policy requires utilities to collect ratepayer money as part of the net energy billing program that provides generators with credit for renewable power they produce and send to the electric grid. Ratepayers also help fund Maine’s low-income assistance program and some storm recovery costs. The PUC decided in April 2023 that Versant Power and Central Maine Power should collect money by charging ratepayers a fixed monthly fee as well as others based on electricity use. The revised rates didn’t kick in until this past July for customers of Versant, which serves northern and eastern Maine. The retread facility at Maine Commercial Tire uses the bulk of the electricity at the company’s Hermon location says Jim Lynch, co-founder of the tire company.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  The fixed rates vary by customer class such as residential, small business, small commercial, medium commercial, large commercial and industrial.Advertisement Electricity use varies significantly among customers in the different classes. Each customer in a particular class pays the same fixed charge regardless of how much electricity is used. Other rates are based on how much electricity is used. Generators of renewable energy also are feeling the impact of sharply higher rates. “I have yet to hear from a member who has benefited from the rate design,” said Eliza Donoghue, executive director of the Maine Renewable Energy Association. In July, just as some were noticing their bills climb, the PUC launched an investigation into the alternate rate designs and may order changes to “adjust for inequities or to effectuate legislative policy directives. ” Regulators said an analysis showed that the fixed charge affected some larger rate classes “dramatically.” Low electricity users in some classes are paying much more than if billed only on the volume of electricity used and large users in some classes paying much less. Several manufacturers met recently with representatives of the Governor’s Energy Office, which said it encouraged businesses to participate in the PUC investigation and will ask regulators to act expeditiously in reviewing the effects of the rate change. DESIGNING EQUITABLE RATESAdvertisement Versant Power said rates that took effect July 1 increased bills for 55 of 76 large customers – classified based on electricity consumption, voltage and other factors – and doubled or more than doubled the bills of 11. Billed amounts decreased for the remainder. Curing chambers, which heat tires for three hours prior to a retread being applied to them, are one of Maine Commercial Tire’s biggest electricity draws, according to Jim Lynch, co-founder of the Hermon company.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  Net energy billing rules have vexed state lawmakers and regulators for years. Gov. Janet Mills and the Legislature expanded eligibility in 2019, directing utilities to buy power from solar projects with up to 5 megawatts of capacity at fixed rates. The change led to a significant rise in community solar projects, raising questions about the cost of the subsidy. Deciding how to pay to promote renewable energy has also led to more PUC cases that make an already complicated issue even more difficult to decipher. The Maine Renewable Energy Association urged regulators to consolidate cases “that can address all of the issues and produce a rate design that is equitable.” “As these lengthy proceedings have amply demonstrated, inequitable results require even more dockets to achieve a rate design that is equitable and within the PUC’s legislative mandate,” the group said. Tony Buxton, a Portland lawyer who represents the Industrial Energy Consumer Group that speaks for manufacturers, said the issue is inscrutable to most electricity customers. “A typical ratepayer has no chance of understanding how to follow this,” he said. And Public Advocate William Harwood called the process “procedurally very messy.” AN EMERGENCY FOR BUSINESSES Falling costs for solar panels also undermine the case for sizable ratepayer subsidies for the solar industry, said Patrick Woodcock, president and chief executive officer of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce. “It makes no sense that we compensate . . . to the extent we are,” said Woodcock, who directed the Maine Energy Office under then-Gov. Paul LePage. Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire, says rising electricity costs are becoming an emergency for businesses.  Gregory Rec/Staff Photographer  Lynch, the co-founder of the commercial tire facility, said businesses in Maine face an emergency over rising electricity costs. “It’s time we pulled the fire alarm,” he said.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nManufacturers in Maine are complaining about sharply increased electricity costs, which they say are threatening their businesses. The cost hike is due to a change in how rates are calculated, which is intended to promote the use of solar and wind power. Large consumers of electricity are particularly affected, with some seeing their bills increase by thousands of dollars. Jim Lynch, co-founder of Maine Commercial Tire, says his electricity bill has increased by $10,000 a year, making it difficult to compete with businesses in low-tax states like New Hampshire. Another business, Milo Chip, says its monthly bill has increased by $6,000, threatening its survival. The Maine Public Utilities Commission is investigating the rate changes and may make adjustments to address inequities. The commission's decision to charge a fixed monthly fee, as well as rates based on electricity use, has been criticized for unfairly burdening large consumers. The Maine Renewable Energy Association is also concerned about the impact of the rate changes on renewable energy generators. The state's net energy billing program has been a source of controversy for years, with questions about how to fairly apportion the cost of promoting renewable energy. The Governor's Energy Office is encouraging businesses to participate in the PUC investigation and is pushing for a quick resolution to the issue."

        "text": "A solar energy study published in June by California's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory is making headlines, as seen in The Mercury News. That's because the report details how — and where — rooftop solar owners see the biggest savings. The good news is that 76% of households studied nationwide saw reduced energy costs, averaging $691. That's after deducting expenses for putting in the system, all according to a summary of the findings from Berkeley. The savings are around $1,987 if the installation costs aren't factored out, per the study, which the experts call a rare examination. \"Few studies quantify the impact of rooftop solar on\" energy burden, they wrote in an abstract published in the journal Nature Communications, via Springer Nature. The analysis, which included 500,000 households, had great news for low-to-moderate-income homeowners. The energy burden reductions were \"most pronounced\" for this group, ranging from $660 to $711. The benefits are greatest in the West and Northeast, where energy costs are typically higher. The South registered the least benefit, due to low electricity prices in the region. Other factors also reduced the savings in certain situations, but most homeowners were in the black, all per Berkeley's report. Absent from the analysis are longer-term benefits of using renewable energy. Solar panels do not release planet-warming fumes when generating power. They also have a life span of 30-plus years, offering free sunpower long after the systems are paid for, as the U.S. Energy Information Administration notes. NASA has linked air pollution to increased risks for severe weather, which is causing more property damage. This, in turn, has caused some insurance companies to raise premiums or discontinue service in heavily storm-hit areas of the country. While one rooftop solar setup isn't going to save the planet, it's part of a growing trend that can contribute to cleaner air in the future, hopefully mitigating some of the worst-case scenarios, feared by climate experts such as those at MIT News. The Solar Energy Industries Association reports that the sector has experienced an average annual growth rate of 25% during the last 10 years. And it's easier than ever to become a part of the trend. EnergySage is a free, online tool that can help you identify all the tax breaks, find the right products, and hire the best installers. Solar installations can qualify for a 30% tax credit on setup costs, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The benefit expires in 2035 unless lawmakers renew it. \"Our goal has always been to make clean energy more accessible and affordable for everyone, and this expansion allows us to reach an even larger audience,\" EnergySage COO Charlie Hadlow said in a press release in July about his company's marketplace expanding to all 50 states. The growth is timely, as Berkeley's analysts have offered perhaps the best evidence yet that solar energy is a worthwhile, money-saving move. \"Rooftop solar effectively reduced energy costs for the great majority of U.S. adopters,\" the experts wrote in the Nature Communications summary.

After a long and tumultuous journey of 70 years, India achieved the milestone of electrifying all the inhabited census villages in India in April 2018 by providing electricity access to 18,374 villages under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Gram Jyoti Yojana. Further, the Government of India electrified 2.8 crore households under Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (PM SAUBHAGYA) to achieve universal household electrification in 2021. It took around seventy years to shed off electrical virginity completely but are these statistics enough to assert that energy poverty has ceased to exist in India? The Encyclopedia of Social Work by Oxford University Press defines energy poverty as a ‘lack of access to adequate, high-quality, clean, and affordable forms of energy or energy systems’. Going by this definition, even with the sustained dedicated efforts by the government, there lies vast scope to alleviate the energy poverty in India.  Electricity is primarily used for lighting, cooking, transport, heating (seasonal) etc. India generates around three-fourths of its electricity from coal. Given the impetus to phase down coal in the wake of climate change, it risks returning to the energy-poor era. Unlike renewables such as solar, wind and hydro, coal is not considered a clean and modern source of energy. From the perspective of the environment, the electricity generated from coal is not of high quality notwithstanding reliability and affordability.  Advertisement  One of the effective strategies to address energy poverty is the Decentralised Renewable Energy (DRE) such as off-grid solar, wind and biomass electricity generation. It has vast potential to ensure a steady supply of electricity to the remote and underserved communities inhabiting inaccessible and poorly connected areas. One such example is Bihar’s first solar village- Dharnai. It got connected to a solar mini-grid in 2014 and the residents embraced the experience of glowing bulbs and rotating fans for the first time. There are further examples of such off-grid solar, wind, and hybrid energy systems in operation in Gujarat, Karnataka, and Rajasthan. The DREs have far-reaching positive effects across the economy, health, education, environment etc. However, the lack of maintenance and repair of mini-grids poses a severe challenge to electricity access as was reflected in the case of Dharnai itself. After three years of being operational, the mini-grid became defunct due to a lack of maintenance and unavailability of funds. In addition to providing access to electricity, the DRE can be leveraged to support the people’s livelihoods. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has devised the framework for the promotion of decentralised renewable energy livelihood applications to guide central and state government departments, ministries and other stakeholders. The framework encapsulates that apart from providing energy access and job creation, the DRE would help in achieving self-reliant India by scaling up the current DRE livelihood applications and supporting the development of new DRE livelihood applications. The DRE-based livelihoods have vast applications in agriculture, agro-processing, dairy, poultry, fisheries, tailoring etc. The DRE livelihood applications require a holistic ecosystem incentivised to (i) deliver efficient appliances, ensure supply chains for manufacturers, operation and maintenance services, (ii) access to credit, (iii) robust backward and forward linkages by ensuring supply of inputs and market access, (iv) capacity building in the form of skill development and training, (v) dedicated cross-sectoral policies and de-risking tools. These five components facilitate an enabling environment for livelihoods based on DRE to thrive sustainably. The DRE livelihoods applications have immense potential in increasing agricultural production, powering rural businesses, improving community services such as healthcare and education, creating new business ventures, empowering women and developing sustainable tourism. However, the intermittency related to solar and wind affects the reliability of the power supply and this problem is exacerbated by insufficient energy storage solutions. The rural areas may have a lack of access to mechanical and technical expertise to repair DRE-powered appliances. Even the high upfront cost of the DRE and the appliances and inaccessibility of the subsidies and the finances discourage the uptake of DRE-based livelihoods. The projects and benefits relying on the grants and subsidies may even suffer in terms of economic sustainability. Inadequate understanding of the advantages of new technology can lead to resistance to their adoption. Barriers may also come from cultural preferences for conventional energy sources. In case of over-reliance on biomass for energy could lead to deforestation and environmental degradation if not managed sustainably. Waste management issues related to solar panel disposal and recycling must be addressed. DRE systems provide a viable option for reducing energy poverty while fostering sustainable development. In energy-poor areas, deploying renewable energy solutions should be prioritised to build resilient, self-sufficient communities that not only boost local economies but also positively impact global environmental goals. The broad implementation and integration of DRE technologies will determine the direction of energy access in the future and will be a major step towards just and sustainable global development. The writer is a research scholar, energy studies programme, at School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi  Advertisement  A new research article published in a peer-reviewed journal shows that India could cut its electricity costs by about 40 per cent with a rapid transition of its power sector from coal to renewables by 2050. Renewable energy has become cheaper than conventional energy sources simply by avoiding the cost of fuel that would otherwise need to be mined or, in the case of natural gas, imported to generate the same electricity.

        "text": "A surprising transportation method is optimizing how companies move heavy-duty materials to offshore wind farms, according to a recent article published in Electrek. Ørsted, a Danish renewable energy company, has begun a new operational campaign. The company will deploy heavy-lift cargo drones to a Dutch offshore wind farm in an effort to reduce the time it takes to transport cargo to offshore wind turbines. Per reports by Electrek, the heavy-lift cargo drone can transport cargo weighing up to 220 pounds. For this new optional campaign, Ørsted will transport materials from a vessel to all 94 wind turbines located at the 752-megawatt Borssele 1 & 2 offshore wind farm. Ørsted will also be updating the evacuation and safety equipment for all its wind turbines. Before the use of heavy-lift cargo drones, a large vessel would sail to each wind turbine, transporting equipment boxes onto the transition piece with a crane. Then, the box would be lifted two more times until reaching the top of the turbine. The heavy-lift cargo drone eliminates the need for the cranes, flying back and forth from the supply vessel to the top of the turbine. This new process is not only more efficient but also much faster. It only takes the cargo drone four minutes to fly from the supply vessel to the top of the turbine — a drastic improvement compared to the original transport method, which typically took six hours. As a result, Ørsted told Electrek it's been able to transport cargo at Borssele 10-15 times faster than normal thanks to the heavy-lift cargo drones. Optimizing offshore wind farms is a step toward a more sustainable future. As wind energy becomes more efficient, more companies will be encouraged to make the switch and help reduce the total amount of global pollution. \"The drones at Borssele 1 & 2…will improve safety, bring down carbon emissions, and reduce the cost of operating offshore wind farms, which all further improve the commercial fundamentals of offshore wind for investors, governments, and corporations,\" Chief Commercial Officer and Deputy CEO at Ørsted Rasmus Errboe told Electrek.

Learn More\n Key Points Interest rates aren't falling quickly, and the appetite for financing is falling on Wall Street. It was a bad week for electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy stocks across the board as consumer spending continues to struggle and EV competition heats up. It hasn't helped that interest rates are up and the economic future isn't certain, causing investors to take risk off the table in areas of energy that haven't proven to be profitable. According to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, shares of Nikola (NKLA -0.52%) fell 11.5% this week as of 1:30 p.m. EDT on Friday, Plug Power (PLUG 9.80%) was down 13.2%, and Li Auto (LI 6.32%) fell 8.3%. And the drop in shares may not be over. The industry overall had a tough week. Earnings reports from Dollar General and Lululemon showed consumers trading down and potentially slowing their level of spending. Consumers drive the economy, so if there's weakness, it could impact everything from auto sales to electricity demand. While the Federal Reserve is still expected to cut rates next month, Atlanta's Fed chief said he wants to see more data before cutting rates. That caused the U.S. government's 10-year bond yield to rise about 10 basis points to 3.91% this week, making it more costly to finance projects.  There was also news that Canada will implement a 100% tariff on EV imports from China, which will reduce the market for companies like Li Auto. Trade wars are heating up in the auto industry, and that could make exports harder for companies producing in China. Nikola announced this week that Thomas Schmitt will take over as the company's chief commercial officer, CCO, aiming to bring the company's products to market more efficiently. But there are bigger problems than getting the commercial operations running better. The company announced a capital raise last week that will bring in an additional $80 million and the potential to increase to a sale of $160 million of convertible notes. As with most capital raises, this could be very dilutive to Nikola long term. This financial reality that more money is needed to execute the company's vision isn't something the market wanted to hear this week. The reality for these companies is their losses are mounting and new funding will be needed to keep the business going. But it's harder to raise money when your stock price falls, which is happening with all three.  PLUG data by YCharts. This is a downward spiral that is hard to get out of in any economic environment. And if interest rates aren't going to fall sharply and consumers aren't going to demand more EVs and clean energy vehicles, the market may not be as big as a lot of these companies hoped. The recent bankruptcies of companies like Fisker, SunPower, and Proterra have proven that there's an end to the ability to finance these businesses without making money. And if the financials don't turn around quickly the downward spiral could continue. Travis Hoium has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy stocks had a bad week due to struggling consumer spending and increasing competition. Interest rates are up, and the economic future is uncertain, causing investors to take risk off the table. Shares of Nikola, Plug Power, and Li Auto fell 11.5%, 13.2%, and 8.3%, respectively, as of Friday. The industry overall had a tough week, with earnings reports showing consumers trading down and potentially slowing their spending. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates next month, but Atlanta's Fed chief wants to see more data before doing so. Canada will implement a 100% tariff on EV imports from China, which will reduce the market for companies like Li Auto. Nikola announced a capital raise of $80 million, which could be dilutive to the company long term. The financial reality for these companies is that they need more funding to execute their vision, but it's harder to raise money when their stock price falls. If interest rates don't fall sharply and consumers don't demand more EVs and clean energy vehicles, the market may not be as big as these companies hoped."

        "text": "It’s now almost an article of faith among energy writers in the bulk of the media that “renewables” are the best form of energy from an environmental point of view. After all, they spew forth no noxious gases. They are also cheap and getting cheaper. Some journalists even argue that they are free: you do not have to pay for sunshine or wind. However, a paper published this month argues that wind and solar are not cheaper than conventional fuels if the full cost of electricity (FCOE) to society is taken into account. Written by Lars Schernikau, William Hayden-Smith, and Rosemary Falcon, the paper, entitled “Full Cost of Electricity (FCOE) and Energy Returns (eROI)” appears in the Journal of Management and Sustainability published by the Canadian Centre of Science and Education.  Anthea Jeffery has drawn on this paper for part of her submission on behalf of the South African Institute of Race Relations to the parliamentary committee considering the Climate Change Bill.  All energy, the paper by the three authors argues, requires taking resources from the planet, processing them, and so harming the environment. Humanity’s goal should be to minimise “these negative impacts” by increasing efficiencies. Energy policy should have three objectives: affordability, security of supply, and environmental protection.  To ensure that energy policy promotes all three of these objectives the paper argues that both the FCOE and the eROI should be taken into account.  More commonly used is the levellised cost of electricity (LCOE). This, however, is misleading because it includes only three measures – the costs of building, fuel, and operation. FCOE, by contrast, measures the full costs of renewable energy to society. It is therefore a more comprehensive measure than the LCOE.  In the first place, there are mining, transportation, investment, and building costs. The mining of lithium and other minerals involves excavation of vast quantities of rock, which necessitates the use of fossil fuels, since wind and solar are too intermittent to be reliable for mining operations. Fossil fuels must also be used for transporting the minerals to wherever wind turbines, solar panels, and storage batteries (“green machines”) are manufactured.  Secondly, there is the cost of fuels, which is a strength for wind and solar, as they themselves have no fuel costs.  Thirdly, there are operating and maintenance costs. The paper says onshore wind and solar cost much the same as coal, but that offshore wind is much more expensive. Solar arrays are relatively cheap, however. Fourth, there is the cost of load balancing, necessary for the very difficult task of stabilizing the grid given the intermittency of wind and solar.  Fifth comes the cost of storage. Excess energy generated by wind and solar on windy and sunny days must be stored for when there is no wind or sunshine. Using fossil fuels, huge quantities of minerals must be mined and transported for battery manufacture. But the necessary storage technology has yet to be developed. This is a serious obstacle to the greater use of wind and solar, for an efficient electricity system must be able to meet demand at all times.  Sixth is the cost of backup. In the absence of sufficient storage capacity for wind and solar, back-up from conventional fossil fuel and/or nuclear energy is required. As the share of wind and solar energy increases, the use of back-up declines, which means that necessary but expensive back-up will lie idle for an increasing part of the time. This is wasteful.  Seventh is the cost of emissions. The CO2 emissions from fossil fuels for use in their own right must be calculated. But so must the emissions from all the fossil fuels used for mining, transporting, and manufacturing green machines.  The eighth factor to be considered is the cost of recycling and other environmental impacts. The paper argues that neither wind blades nor solar panels can be recycled, while the decaying of discarded batteries is environmentally harmful. So, as already noted, is all the mining needed for green machines.  Ninth is “room costs”, such as land footprint and energy sprawl. Because the intermittency of wind and solar means that they have a low power density, much more space is needed for turbines and solar panels than for conventional power stations. Stephen Davies of the American Institute for Economic Research has pointed out that you get plenty of energy from a small amount of coal or uranium, but that if you wanted to power Los Angeles entirely with solar, you would need to cover an area several times the size of that city with solar panels. Schernikau and his co-writers note that a new solar park in India would need 33 times as much space as a new coal-fired power station to produce the same amount of electricity.  Number ten is other metrics, such as the energy return on investment (eROI). This refers to the input of energy needed to produce the energy output needed. A high eROI means lower environmental and economic costs, and thus lower prices and higher utility. A low eROI means higher environmental and economic costs, and thus higher prices and lower utility.    The return on energy invested is highest for nuclear, followed at some distance by coal and gas, with renewables much further behind. “The principle of energy return on investment is at the core of society’s energy efficiency, which is at the core of humanity’s development and survival.”  Schernikau et al argue that the very low return for wind and solar arises from their intermittency along with their need for backup and storage. Their very low return on energy invested means that they are “a step backward in history in terms of energy efficiency”.  The envisaged dramatic expansion in wind and solar will result in a more fragile and expensive electricity system, with the risk of prolonging the energy crisis that started in the second half of last year. This crisis they attribute to lack of investment in conventional forms of energy, while increased use of wind and solar has been unable to satisfy demand.  Schernikau and his colleagues also make the point that if solar and wind were truly cheaper, as is frequently claimed, they would not require “trillions of dollars of government funding or subsidies, or laws to enforce their installation”.  * John Kane-Berman is a policy fellow at the IRR, a think-tank that promotes political and economic freedom.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nA recent paper argues that wind and solar energy are not cheaper than conventional fuels when considering the full cost of electricity (FCOE) to society. The FCOE measures the full costs of renewable energy, including mining, transportation, investment, and building costs. The mining and transportation of minerals for wind turbines, solar panels, and storage batteries require fossil fuels, which contributes to environmental harm. The paper suggests that energy policy should prioritize affordability, security of supply, and environmental protection.

        "text": "The United States increased its electricity generation from utility-scale solar power by nearly one-third in the first half of this year compared to the same period last year. Despite that considerable increase in solar, the climate benefits of this growth were undermined by a rapid rise in electricity demand, which was met in large part by an increase in generation from fossil fuels. This week, the Energy Information Administration released electricity generation statistics for June, which allows for a close look at where we stand halfway through 2024. The numbers tell a story of a country moving in the right direction, but not nearly fast enough. Explore the latest news about what’s at stake for the climate during this election season. First, the topline: Generation from utility-scale power plants was 2.1 million gigawatt-hours from January to June, an increase of 5 percent from January to June of 2023. That’s the highest percentage increase in decades when comparing the first half of a year to the first half of the prior year. Grid planners and analysts have warned that the country is entering a period of rapid growth in electricity consumption to meet the needs of data centers, factories and other new construction. This follows a time of modest growth, which was due to a variety of factors, including the high efficiency of new lighting, appliances and building methods. Heat, including the second-hottest June on record, is also a major factor when assessing energy consumption this year. Rapid growth in electricity demand makes it harder for policymakers and energy companies to deal with climate change because it increases the size of the pool that new carbon-free electricity sources need to fill, and it hurts the economic case for shutting down fossil fuel power plants. That said, generation from carbon-free power sources grew significantly in the first half of 2024. Utility-scale solar plants generated 102,615 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 30 percent from the first half of 2023. Wind farms, both offshore and onshore, generated 247,434 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 8 percent. Generation from fossil fuels also grew. Natural gas power plants—the country’s largest source of electricity by a wide margin—generated 857,023 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 5 percent. Coal-fired power plants generated 303,027 gigawatt-hours, an increase of 1 percent. Put another way, gas and coal increased by a combined 46,843 gigawatt-hours, and wind and solar increased by a combined 42,698 gigawatt-hours. That’s pretty depressing, so I’ll also note that the sum of increases in carbon-free sources, which includes nuclear, wind, solar and others, was 51,711 gigawatt-hours, and was more than the sum of the increases in gas and coal. The larger point is that the growth in generation from carbon-free electricity sources needs to far outpace fossil sources by a lot, and it isn’t. So far this year, the country’s power companies are building vastly more renewable energy power plants than other types. Of the 375 new generating units that came online so far this year, 243 were utility-scale solar farms; 75 were utility-scale battery systems, which often work in tandem with renewable energy; 17 were onshore wind farms and 1 was an offshore wind farm, South Fork Wind off of New York. (Figures are from EIA’s power plant database, counting new generating units from January to July.) During the same period, 38 natural gas or petroleum-burning units went online, and one new nuclear unit went online, at the Vogtle plant in Georgia. There were zero new coal plants. The new units have 23,326 megawatts of capacity; 76 percent of this total comes from solar and batteries, and 95 percent comes from carbon-free sources (solar, batteries, onshore wind, offshore wind and nuclear). Texas led the country in new construction, with a heavy emphasis on solar. California ranked second and was the leader in batteries. This graphic from my colleague Paul Horn shows where new plants were built, which could be fodder for dozens of stories about what’s driving investment on a state-by-state basis. The main caveat is that we’re talking about just seven months of new plants, and some states may have significant activity right before or right after this period. It’s going to take some time for the new units to have much of an effect on national electricity generation statistics. Some of the new units are only a month or two old and not yet fully operational. Also, the list includes units completed in July, which would mean none of their output is included in the generation figures, which cover the first half the year. I want to caution against exuberance about how much carbon-free resources are dominating new construction in this narrow timeframe. To cut carbon emissions to a meaningful extent, it’s not enough for solar, wind and batteries to have a big lead in the number and capacity of new units. The lead needs to be gigantic and sustained over many years. And fossil electricity generation needs to fall, on a sustained basis, over many years. Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week: General Motors and Samsung SDI Finalize Team-Up Plans in Indiana: General Motors and Samsung SDI said they have reached a final agreement on a joint venture announced last year to open a battery manufacturing plant near South Bend, Indiana, as Heekyong Yang and David Shepardson report for Reuters. The plan includes a one-year delay in the plant’s opening, which would now be in 2027, a sign that the companies may be expecting battery demand to grow more slowly than they had previously projected. Even if it takes an extra year to open, the $3.5 billion investment and 1,600 jobs are significant for Indiana. Tesla’s Rivals Still Can’t Use Its Superchargers: Last year, automakers coalesced around plans to allow most electric cars to be able to charge using Tesla’s Supercharger network, which was hailed at the time as a step forward for U.S. charging infrastructure. But the network remains largely inaccessible to people who don’t drive Teslas because of software delays and hardware shortages, as Jack Ewing reports for The New York Times. There is speculation that the delays may be partly due to Tesla CEO Elon Musk having second thoughts about opening up the network to help other automakers at a time when his company’s vehicle sales have dropped. EV Manufacturing Is Coming to Kentucky, But Drivers and Dealers Slow to Move Away From Gas: The Louisville Courier Journal has published a series of stories examining how automakers are making large manufacturing investments in Kentucky and how the state’s drivers and auto dealers feel about EVs at a time when they are about to become an important part of local economic growth. Ford and Toyota are the two major players in this wave of investment. States Use Carrots and Sticks to Deal With Opposition to Renewable Development: Some experts worry that recent laws in Illinois, Michigan and New York designed to help overcome local opposition to renewable energy development could help to intensify opposition, as Brian Martucci reports for Utility Dive. The state laws are part of a larger picture of state and local governments responding to a rise in objections to renewable energy projects that threaten to slow the shift away from fossil fuels. Swiss Solar Company Cancels Plans for Colorado Factory: Meyer Burger, a Swiss solar manufacturer, has scrapped plans to build a new factory in Colorado Springs that would have had more than 350 jobs, as Sam Brasch reports for Colorado Public Radio. The company said the decision was related to a Biden administration action this month on tariffs that allows for more imports of solar components from China and other Asian markets for use by companies making solar panels. Many solar companies praised the easing of tariffs, but Meyer Burger is among those that stood to lose because of low-cost competition with its planned factory.

Not only are solar panels a significant expense, but they also represent a commitment that can last decades. That’s why this is not a decision that you should rush into. Instead, take the time to review the disadvantages of solar energy so that you can confidently make the decision that is right for you. Featured Partners 1 Palmetto Solar BBB Grade A+ Financing Options Purchase, loan, PPA Number of States Covered 27 1 Palmetto Solar From Participating Partners 2 Blue Raven Solar BBB A+ Financing Options $0 upfront for 18 months Number of States Covered 21 2 Blue Raven Solar From Participating Partners 3 Momentum Solar BBB Grade A+ Financing Options Purchase, loan Number of States Covered 10 3 Momentum Solar From Participating Partners While you are looking at solar energy pros and cons, perhaps the biggest solar energy disadvantage that sticks out is the expense with the best solar panels often demanding a premium. Beyond that, there are several other potentially negative factors you should consider before moving ahead. Many people consider solar panels because of the long-term savings potential. However, that comes with a steep upfront price: On average, residential solar panels cost $16,000—with $3,500 on the low end and $35,000 on the high end. These costs depend on factors such as the amount of solar panels needed, the type of solar panels used and where you live. The cost of solar panels can vary significantly even within the continental United States. For example, the starting cost for a six-kW system in Wisconsin is $17,580 compared to a $13,101 starting cost for a comparable system in Tennessee. Currently, the federal government provides a 26% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for systems installed in 2022. However, that rate is set to dip to 22% for systems installed in 2023. Unless the credit is renewed, it is due to expire in 2024. If you’re considering installing solar panels in a year or two from now, that means you may want to anticipate it costing even more. If you don’t have funds available to pay for solar panels outright, there are numerous solar panel financing options available. The catch is that the average interest rate for loans like these is more than 6%, which means you will ultimately spend quite a bit more money while paying the interest. To determine how many solar panels you need, you’ll first need to understand how much electricity your home uses on a monthly basis. Your personal sum should be listed on your utility bill as “kWh used” for one month’s demand. If you are building a home and aren’t sure of your energy demands, keep in mind that the average household needs 867 kilowatt-hours (kW/h) per month in electrical power. Once you know your kW/h number for the month, divide that by 30 to get a daily kW/h number. For example, if you use 900 kW/h per month, that translates to roughly 30 kW/h per day. As a rule of thumb, one solar panel generates one kW/h per day. So, for this example, you would need 30 solar panels on your home. This can be a disadvantage both because of cost and the logistical challenges presented by having so many solar panels on your roof. Solar panels can complicate home repairs—especially if you need to repair the roof. That could result in an average expense of $2,500 to remove and reinstall solar panels. The best approach is to thoroughly repair and reinforce your roof before installing solar panels, although this too adds to the cost. Not surprisingly, solar panels rely on the sun. If your home doesn’t receive a consistent amount of sunlight, this may not be the option for you. What is surprising is that even homes in seemingly sunny areas still may not be good candidates for solar energy: The biggest factor determining the potential efficacy of solar panels is the latitude at which a home is situated. For example, even if a home at a high latitude has mostly sunny weather, the overall effect for the year is that there are fewer hours of sunlight. Unless you are able to “bank” solar energy with a battery or buy-back program from your local utility company, homes up north may not get enough solar energy during darker winter months to sustain themselves independently. Even closer to the equator, homes in places that experience a lot of cloudy, rainy days may not get enough sunlight. The same goes for homes in densely shaded areas. If you are going off-grid, you will need to budget for solar batteries to bank the energy you get during the day for use overnight or during darker seasons. With installation, home batteries for solar panels cost roughly $10,000 to $20,000.\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS AN ADVERTISEMENT AND NOT EDITORIAL CONTENT.

Solar panels are also difficult and costly to move: On average, it costs $3,750 to remove and reinstall solar panels. Beyond the expense, if you remove solar panels from a home after a long period of time, you will need to repair the roof.

This starts with the production process when greenhouse gasses are emitted while manufacturing solar panels. According to the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy, it takes between one and four years to “payback” the energy that was used to create the solar panel system. If you need to dispose of solar panels, it’s not as simple as taking them to the landfill. Solar panels are made with substances such as cadmium and lead-acid, which are fine when they are contained within the panels. However, they are dangerous pollutants if allowed to leach into the ground. For that reason, you must plan to properly dispose of solar panels and there currently are not widespread recycling options. \n                Looking For Hassle-Free Solar Installation\n             Find a network of trusted installers for solar system, solar panels and electricity needs.

        "text": "Now Reading By Jenn Mullen, Contributor By Jenn Mullen, Contributor Published 04-03-24 Submitted by Keysight Technologies The Covid-19 pandemic heightened existing pressure points in nearly every sector and industry. The pandemic exacerbated the already crisis-level burnout that healthcare workers were struggling with. Hospital networks are struggling to keep pace with more patients requiring care from a shrinking healthcare professional workforce. Inflation, increased doctor-patient ratios, and a shrinking healthcare talent pool have stretched the medical industry to its breaking point. Even before the pandemic, hospital networks across the globe were investigating ways that digital healthcare technologies could improve access to healthcare, improve efficiency, and keep healthcare costs low. During the pandemic, the adoption of digital technologies accelerated and contributed to the resilience of healthcare systems during the challenges presented by the pandemic. Digital health technologies that leverage AI contribute to improving the efficiency and effectiveness of hospital systems in meaningful ways, including cost reductions, improved access to healthcare, and resource optimization. AI-enabled clinical decision-making support for healthcare workers Due to the healthcare talent shortages, practicing clinicians see more patients than ever before and must balance efficiency with quality of care. Because of their automation capabilities and abilities to learn from large volumes of patient data and medical research, AI-enabled healthcare technologies are playing an increasingly large role in improving physical decision making when it comes to diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing care. Equally-- if not more-- importantly, are the benefits to clinicians. AI-powered clinical decision support can analyze patient data, medical literature, and the most recent best practices to provide physicians with evidence-based recommendations to diagnose, treat, and manage care for their growing number of patients. This allows clinicians to make better informed and far more personalized decisions regarding treatment planning and medication selection for patients. AI can also enable real-time alert automation to notify clinicians of critical findings, flag potential medication errors, and highlight missed opportunities for preventative care. These digital healthcare technologies can make a meaningful impact on morale and job satisfaction for medical workers. They help healthcare workers make well-informed decisions while also reducing cognitive burden in physicians, improve the practitioners’ ability to see and treat more patients without sacrificing quality of care, and ensure better patient outcomes. AI applications for healthcare networks In healthcare, the delivery of timely care and treatment is very literally a life and death issue. Healthcare supply chains are intricate, massive machines comprised of various mechanisms that orchestrate the delivery of services needed to ensure patient care. These supply chains are far more complicated than others because they include people and are significantly impacted by the needs of individual patients. AI-supported technologies are improving the quality of care and efficiency of medical resources. AI applications for hospital networks can connect the different clinics, labs, and diagnostics to create a holistic view of the entire network, thus enabling improved coordination and communication between various channels. It can then perform predictive analysis of historical appointment data, demographics, and clinic capacities to forecast appointment demands with far greater accuracy. In turn, hospital managers can optimize resources and scheduling, resulting in shorter patient wait times. AI-driven chatbots and virtual assistants are also helping hospital networks to run more smoothly by automating appointment scheduling, prescription refills, and billing inquiries. By reducing administrative burdens for healthcare staff, AI frees up time for healthcare workers to focus on patient care and clinical tasks. AI can perform routine, repetitive operational tasks and improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosing conditions like cancer much faster than humans. By reducing administrative burdens for healthcare staff, AI frees up time for healthcare workers to focus on patient care and clinical tasks while also making hospitals more cost-effective. Telemedicine and remote monitoring AI-enabled telehealth and remote monitoring capabilities increase access to healthcare, improve communication between healthcare providers, and improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of quality patient care. Artificial intelligence enables hospitals to share data and collaborate effectively on cases while preserving patient privacy. This facilitates more confidence in virtual consultations and enables more comprehensive care by allowing multi-disciplinary healthcare teams to coordinate patient care from different locations. Rural patients often travel long distances for medical appointments and diagnostics and will do so out of necessity. However, once they have resolved their acute medical issues, these patients may not return for follow-up visits. The proliferation of wearable health monitoring devices enables physicians to monitor patients and make real-time, data-driven medical decisions without requiring the patient to be on-site. AI and telemedicine are allowing practitioners to expand virtual care options throughout the treatment plan that can improve patient experience and their outcomes. Barriers to adoption of AI in medicine The benefits of AI-driven tools in healthcare are numerous, and their aid in building resilience is promising. However, there are many barriers to widespread adoption that device manufacturers and healthcare IT professionals must consider. Regulations, data privacy, interoperability, a lack of standardization, and resistance to change represent significant hurdles that must be considered. Building back a stronger, more resilient healthcare industry The post-pandemic world is increasingly relying on AI and automation to optimize resources and streamline operations. The healthcare sector has seen an explosion in technology that can aid practitioners in combatting burnout and optimize resources and operations in hospital networks.

        "text": "A recent survey conducted by Wolters Kluwer Health unveils insights into U.S. physicians' attitudes towards the integration of generative AI (GenAI) in healthcare. According to the findings, 40% of physicians are ready to utilize GenAI in patient interactions at the point of care within this year.  But more importantly, the survey indicates a notable shift in perception, with 68% of respondents stating a change in their views over the past year, now viewing GenAI as potentially beneficial for healthcare. Despite this growing acceptance, physicians express cautiousness regarding the types of GenAI tools they are willing to adopt. Most (91%) emphasize the importance of GenAI materials being developed by medical professionals, while 89% demand transparency from vendors regarding the sourcing and creation of information.Dr. Peter Bonis, Chief Medical Officer at Wolters Kluwer Health, highlights the significance of content source and transparency, emphasizing that physicians prioritize trustworthy applications of generative AI in clinical settings.\"Physicians are open to using generative AI in a clinical setting provided that applications are useful and trustworthy. The source of content and transparency are key considerations,\" Dr. Peter Bonis said in a press release statement.Physicians perceive GenAI as a transformative technology capable of addressing challenges such as staffing shortages and burnout in healthcare. They anticipate several advantages, including improved care team interactions with patients, time savings, and enhanced decision-making processes at the point of care.Contrastingly, a comparison between physician and consumer perspectives reveals disparities in views regarding the integration of GenAI. While two-thirds of physicians believe patients would trust GenAI results for clinical decisions, only slightly over half of patients share this sentiment. Moreover, physicians underestimate patient concerns regarding GenAI usage in diagnoses, highlighting a significant perception gap between healthcare providers and consumers.

Additionally, a majority of physicians believe that GenAI has the potential to yield time savings of 20% or more. Furthermore, over two-thirds  (68%) of physicians assert that GenAI can expedite the process of searching medical literature, facilitating efficient access to relevant information.Similarly, three in five physicians (59%) indicate that GenAI can streamline tasks by summarizing patient data extracted from electronic health records (EHR). Conversely, a small minority, comprising only 3% of physicians, believe that GenAI will not contribute to improving interactions with patients. The survey underscores the evolving landscape surrounding the adoption of GenAI, with many physicians indicating a lack of clear guidelines or policies within their organizations. Despite this, physicians emphasize the importance of transparency and content sourcing when selecting GenAI tools. Most prioritize tools trained on content developed by medical professionals, while transparency from vendors regarding data sourcing and technology origins is deemed essential. The survey involved 100 respondents who are U.S. physicians working in large hospitals and/or health systems, actively seeing patients, and utilizing clinical decision-support tools.

        "text": "Coming into 2024, we are truly in the midst of another AI hype cycle. As radiologists, my colleagues and I have become accustomed to claims that AI can solve the NHS’s workforce crisis. The truth is that this technology is incredibly exciting, but do we need a reality check before the NHS gets too carried away by the promise of AI? In recent years, we have seen huge excitement about the potential for AI to replace radiologists, particularly in the context of the radiology workforce crisis. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) has been calling for greater investment to grow the radiologist workforce for years, but these calls have been mostly brushed aside. The radiologist workforce grew by just 3% in 2022, whilst the RCR estimates that there is currently a 29% shortfall of clinical radiologists in the UK. (1) Attempts to increase the consultant radiologist workforce are underway, but improvements are simply not keeping up with demand. Last year, 44 million imaging tests were reported in England alone – an increase of 26% from the previous year. This huge pressure on radiology services not only means that patients are waiting longer for their scan results but also that there is an increased risk of reporting errors. Only 24% of clinical directors currently think that their radiology department has enough clinical radiologists to provide safe and effective patient care. (2) AI tools in the NHS for medical imaging are even more attractive because healthcare systems simply cannot function without radiology. Over 3.6 billion radiology exams are conducted globally each year, including 43 million in the UK alone. Every medical department relies on radiology to provide diagnoses; without a diagnosis, treatment is often impossible. We must also remember that AI technology isn’t just an innovation for higher-income countries but could also be used to address the huge inequalities when accessing healthcare resources worldwide. This is perhaps where there could be most impact for patients. A lot of the technology and skills are concentrated in a small number of countries, but AI tools that help do things at scale will have a hugely important role in improving global access to healthcare. In June 2023, the UK Government announced a £21m investment in AI tools in the NHS, with Trusts able to apply for funding through the AI Diagnostic Fund to help speed up diagnoses. This was incredibly welcome news to those working in chronically overstretched radiology departments, but was this putting the cart before the horse? Unfortunately, too many radiology departments still use paper-based or telephone-based systems, relying on siloed PACs (picture archiving and communications systems) and Radiology Information Systems (RIS), making it extremely difficult to review and share scans. Some hospitals even struggle to get a reliable wireless internet connection. I can’t have been the only one to wonder whether digitising the NHS’s diagnostic services to make them AI-ready would have been a better use of government funding. Instead, we’re now in the slightly surreal position of having funding for AI tools in the NHS but not for the necessary digital infrastructure to support it. There are also huge benefits associated with digitising diagnostic services beyond supporting new AI tools. A 2023 NHS pilot at North West Anglia NHS Foundation Trust (NWAFT), in collaboration with radiology company Hexarad, digitised on-call diagnostic services at two major hospitals, which resulted in increased clinical capacity and faster delivery of emergency diagnostic services. Early results from that pilot suggest that implementing the digital platform reduced vetting time by 84.3% (30 minutes to 4.7 minutes) and streamlined the management pathway of more than 8800 patients, aiding fast and accurate diagnosis. The time saved is estimated to be between 12 and 14 hours per night, the equivalent of one extra clinician per shift in a ten-doctor department. To achieve this same outcome, a hospital would need to spend £365,000 per annum on locum agency fees. Results like these demonstrate the huge benefits of digital transformation for NHS diagnostic services, while at the same time putting Trusts in a better position to embrace AI technology when it is ready for wider implementation. Like many radiologists, I see a future where radiology departments (not just radiologists) can work seamlessly with AI tools. A patient’s radiology journey starts from the moment their doctor decides they need a scan, but several logistical steps need to happen before the scan results are ready. We spend a lot of time and resources on the most complex part of the pathway, namely interpreting the scan. However, AI and automation could streamline pathways such as patient booking or managing the supply and demand of both scanning and radiologist capacity. However, the promise of AI shouldn’t close our eyes to the reality of the state of radiology in the NHS right now. In many places, the digital infrastructure isn’t there to allow AI tools in the NHS to work. We need to make sure that the solutions being developed and funded truly address our most pressing problems. Sometimes, those problems will be diagnostic, but often, streamlining workflow or data collection can be just as effective. Technology cannot fix a broken process. It feels like we’re on another upward curve in AI at the moment, where the enthusiasm and excitement at the prospect of an ‘easy fix’ for the NHS are at an all-time high. Recent discussions about AI have done little to temper this in the popular imagination. Still, we must hope that NHS leadership can see that digital transformation, including AI, is what will make the biggest impact on improving diagnostic services. Innovation very rarely follows a constant upward trend. There will certainly be a future for AI in healthcare, but it might not be quite the one we expect.

        "text": "AI is proving to be a broadly transformative technology, applied across every industry. Without a doubt the healthcare industry grapples with the best way to apply AI to deliver results and quality to patients, care providers, support staff, and all aspects of the industry. At the recent 2024 SXSW Conference and Festivals that took place in March 2024, Dr. Jag Singh, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, focusing on the application of AI in the practice of medicine, and practicing cardiologist at Mass General Brigham (MGB) spoke on the topic of “Rethinking and Reinventing Medicine”. In a followup interview on the AI Today podcast, Dr. Jag Singh expanded on his talk, and shares additional insights for this article. Q: Healthcare was a big theme at the 2024 SXSW Conference and Festivals. What do you see as the hot topics in the industry today? Dr. Jag Singh: Most recently, I wrote a book called “Future Care Sensors, AI, and the Reinvention of Medicine”, which was a focus of my talk at the 2024 SXSW Conference. Let’s take a step back and really lay the ground for why AI is so important in healthcare. Part of it is because healthcare as we understand it is pretty much unsustainable the way it is. It's what we call, “big, fat and sick” and it requires resuscitation. Part of that problem is because we're nontransparent. We're very opaque in the way we reimburse health care and in the way we practice health care. Just to give you an example, 20% of our GDP in the US, about $4 trillion, goes towards healthcare. And we're still indefensible on most of the care quality metrics. Those care quality metrics are relevant to the question of the AI perspective. Also we're a living contradiction here in the US, because 3 out of 4 dollars are spent in looking after patients with chronic diseases. Over and above and beyond that, the wellness of our institutions is dependent on the sickness of our patients. That is where AI can help us flip that conversation. Now, with unlimited connectivity, and ubiquitous data and massive processing power, we are uniquely poised now to actually transform the way we deliver care. The future of care is largely going to be virtual, with sensors, with AI, in sustainable workflows that will translate into better outcomes. I look at it specifically as analytic AI, which is conventional AI and generative AI, because of how we're actually looking after patients and even physicians. AI clearly has a role in predicting disease, whether it's cancer or heart disease or any other disease state. But most importantly, I think the only way that healthcare can become sustainable is to introduce self management strategies where patients can have more skin in the game. AI will empower patients to play a role also in managing their own diseases, or what I call as MYOD, manage your own disease. As a simple example can be seen with diabetes. You have a sensor that can measure blood glucose level that is connected to your insulin pump, that using AI based approaches can adjust your insulin dose. So there are feedback loops using AI and sensor based approaches already in small situations in single disease states being put into play. As you can only imagine that as we talk about complex diseases, this is going to have a significant way in actually impacting personalized care. Q: How do you see wearables and sensors tying into the use of AI in healthcare? Dr. Jag Singh: All of us experienced during COVID as we tried to stay away from the hospitals, that we still wanted to get the care we needed to get. Telehealth, or virtual care, now is a common terminology, but an umbrella terminology. The pendulum, unfortunately, has swung back a little bit because of regulatory issues. Out-of-state virtual care, where you actually need to do out-o-state virtual care in rural areas, is not that easily amenable or reimbursable. Much of that is going to come back because patients are going to expect them. And I think patient expectations are going to trump regulatory issues in the near future, because also that's the only way you can eventually access care. If we're talking about all the social determinants of health and the inequity of care, virtual care is probably the first step in actually giving patients access and also at the same time declutter the busy outpatient areas of large academic and tertiary centers where a lot of these things can be done virtually. But I think virtual care or a video based care visit is actually just a highly glorified, sophisticated phone call where you're actually seeing the patient, and that's where you need sensors. You need sensors to provide us with objective data, as if you're actually interacting or interfacing with the patient in the clinic room, where you have objective data to make that assessment. And that's where sensors really make an important part of clinical practice. There are implantable sensors and there are wearable sensors. Whether they're watches, whether they're necklaces, whether they're rings, whether they're tattoo sensors, ambient sensors, sensors on the walls that can check our gait or stability. There are sensors on the toilet seats now that can actually measure your weight, record your ECG, and study your microbiome, so they really provide you with objective evidence that is oftentimes missing in a routine clinical visit. At the same time, they really allow for individualized care. I think that's where medicine is eventually going is through virtual care and through sensor aided technology. Q: What are you working on or implementing today at Mass General Brigham and in research? Dr. Jag Singh: We already have at Mass General Brigham (MGB) AI chatbots and we're experimenting with how they can respond in a very empathetic way to patient queries regarding their data or certain questions. It can construct an approach that relieves the burden on the clinicians. The second place we're implementing AI at MGB, is to have ambient note technologies where you actually walk into the clinic, you talk to the patient, and your electronic medical record has a note that is generated from your conversation, which is a proper clinic note. This will really reduce the burnout and reduce the burden on clinicians by liberation from keyboards, and at the same time unchaining us from the mundane activities like prescription writing and pre-authorizations and things to that effect. There's already an impact of AI in places like pathology and radiology with computer vision. The machine sees a lot of things better than human eyes can, and actually helps categorize risk and classify risk better than we can. That's a place which is a low hanging fruit. Additionally, we already have AI based strategies that are becoming a part of clinical practice. There are single disease states such as diabetes or chronic obstructive lung disease, where you have a sensor and you have an AI based approach and algorithm to manage those patients. In the long term, how can you continue to aggregate continuous data? How can you put AI logic into it to provide that hyperpersonalized care? I think this is where we're all going towards to enhance the level of digital equity and thereby global health equity, to democratize the delivery of care all across the world. And I think if there's anything that can do it, it's this whole burgeoning digital metamorphosis, this whole sensor AI union of providing care.

The first two reports are in The Press issues of May 12, 2023, and Oct. 26, 2023.      • • • The Economist cover story in its March 30, 2024 edition has this to say about artificial intelligence:  “…in the field of health care, it has the potential to be transformational. In Europe analysts predict that deploying AI could save hundreds of thousands of lives each year.”  In America, it is estimated AI has the potential to “shave $200bn-$360bn from annual medical spending.” That would be a huge savings, as the United States spends $4.5tn a year on health care, 17 percent of its GNP. Many health institutions report they are using, or planning to use AI to: (a) enhance diagnostic accuracy, (b) improve disease tracking, (c) improve predictions of patients’ outcome, (d) recommend better treatments, (e) reduce time for drugs to reach clinical trials, and others.  The health care industry is short-staffed. It is predicted by AI/health care experts that AI will lead to more tasks being off-loaded to computers, thereby reducing the need for certain health care workers. It is estimated if present trends continue, by 2030 the industry will be short of 10 million workers.  The stated goals of health care are to first improve care with reducing costs being second. Improved care costs more money and as technology continues to improve, that translates into even more expensive treatments. AI is viewed by some of its supporters as a financial and medical godsend to the health care industry. …And other industries as well.  However, this writer has documented in the two previous articles of problems with the technology.  First, AI does not always produce accurate information. Second, in some AI systems, its creators do not understand how the AI software/hardware produces this information. This serious problem is known by two names: hallucinating or confabulating. Stated another way, one AI expert said the technology sometimes “makes things up.” I am far from being an expert on artificial intelligence. I have studied it and examined how the technology works, but much of it remains a mystery to me. But it also is a mystery to some who work in the AI field.  AI skeptics have stated, “The AI models…do not always respond in the same way to the same stimulus. …This raises philosophical and practical problems for those who [use AI] to regulate medical devices.” Of course, other devices as well, such as missile launchers or robots performing surgeries.   While this writer does not claim to be AI-literate, he is well experienced as a medical patient. I am uneasy that I may be faced with having an instrument inserted in my chest to monitor or control heart conditions when that device, if AI driven, might make errors in keeping me alive.  Perhaps I am overreacting, and I have learned that certain AI systems hallucinate more than others. I’m told that the field of artificial intelligence is relatively new, and it will continue to be fine-tuned to eventually be much less likely to hallucinate.   Maybe so, and I do not want to come across as a technology Luddite. From what I gather in today’s systems, AI obtains its information and feeds output to humans through mathematics and probability calculations. In essence, “The fundamental problem is that language models [the prevalent AI systems use today] are probabilistic, while truth is not.”  Naysayers claim the AI systems that are built on probability theory (chance variations) “will never be completely rid of hallucinations.”      As it stands now, I do not want AI machines inserted into my chest to control my afib. And I hope we all agree that we do not want — at this stage of the technology — to have AI robots doing gene splicing or launching missiles.  On the other side of the coin, AI is proving to be able to solve complex problems involving millions of pieces of information that are far beyond humans’ cognitive powers. “Dennis Hassabis, one of the founders of DeepMind, an AI power house that is now part of Google, thinks that [AI] will change the way humans understand life itself.” AI is growing at a phenomenal rate. Money is to be made in AI investments — a lot of money. I offer a modest proposal about using AI: Beware of the Law of the Instrument, exemplified by the child, with hammer in hand, who looks for something to pound. • • • During his career, Uyless Black consulted and lectured in 16 countries on computer networks and the architecture of the internet.

        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nThe Economist reports that artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to save hundreds of thousands of lives in healthcare each year in Europe. In the US, AI could reduce annual medical spending by $200-$360 billion. Many health institutions are using or planning to use AI to enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve disease tracking, and recommend better treatments. However, the healthcare industry is facing a shortage of workers, with a predicted deficit of 10 million workers by 2030. AI may help alleviate this shortage by offloading tasks to computers. Despite its potential benefits, AI is not without problems, including producing inaccurate information and \"hallucinating\" or making things up. This is a serious concern, particularly in high-stakes applications like medical devices and missile launchers. The author, who is not an AI expert but has experience as a medical patient, is uneasy about relying on AI-driven devices for his care. While AI has the potential to solve complex problems, its limitations and potential for error must be acknowledged. The author urges caution in the development and deployment of AI technology."

Here’s how it works.\n With pressure increasing on healthcare systems globally and many countries still struggling to clear the backlog from the pandemic, Microsoft believes AI holds the key to addressing both administrative burdens and improving the clinician-patient experience. A new study from the company of 13,500 patients across 11 countries, including 2,000 from the UK, found patients are prepared to let AI handle some of their clinicians' work to free up more interpersonal time, seeing it as a natural progression of existing digitalization efforts. Currently, two in five (39%) UK respondents are concerned that their doctor does not give them their full attention during treatment, thanks to the computer-based administrative work that goes hand-in-hand with consultations. From the patient’s point of view, artificial intelligence is simply an extension of existing systems. Half of the UK participants in Microsoft’s study already have access to private or health insurance-provided online platforms where documents and prescriptions are shared. For the clinician, an injection of AI represents a considerable time saving – the extra hours typically put in by a doctor to tackle medical documentation have fuelled widespread job dissatisfaction and burnout. Dr Simon Wallace, Chief Clinical Information Office at Microsoft Health and Life Sciences UK, highlighted the significant effect that AI could have on patient care: “The role of digital technology is to support the clinician to return to the art of practicing medicine and give back time both for patients and their personal well-being.” Mr Markus Vogel, Chief Medical Information Officer for Microsoft, commented on AI’s role in personalizing healthcare for patients: “With automated processes and patient-driven chatbots providing assistance, AI becomes a catalyst for enhanced participation, language translation and personalized treatment modalities.” Sign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed! With its continued emphasis on safe and responsible AI, Microsoft is calling for education, training, and communication about the benefits, impact, and even risks of artificial intelligence in healthcare. It has also become clear that international and multi-sector collaboration play an important role in ensuring that communities are served. Looking forward, it’s clear that time-saving technologies like artificial intelligence and automation play a pivotal part in how nations address some of the most pressing social issues, and Microsoft’s findings regarding public sentiment surrounding the technology spell out a pretty positive outlook. As for the challenges, industry experts have expressed concerns that practitioners may not be so keen to adapt to yet another new technology. However, speaking about the clinician-led nature of NHS England, National Digital Primary Care Nurse Lead Helen Crowther affirmed: “If you give us a new product and tell us that it’s going to transform and change our lives for ourselves, colleagues, and patients, we’re more than happy to adapt to it.” As healthcare and artificial intelligence become increasingly entwined, Crowther noted the importance of involving nurses at all levels of digital transformation in order to ensure that they are clinically focused from concept. This sentiment aligns with the broader feeling that collaboration in all aspects of technology can only be beneficial, both for the customer and for competition.

The other risks are based around financial performance, competition,  workforce and cybersecurity, with AI and new technologies affecting most of those categories, according to the report. The efficiencies gained from AI tools must be weighed against the costs of implementing AI and training employees to use the tools properly to gauge the overall impact on financial performance. The benefits of AI can only be realized if the organization can solve the workforce challenges of recruiting employees with the right skills to manage these tools and their attendant risks, and training employees to use them. AI automation also could increase turnover as employees without the necessary skills to use these tools leave the organization, raising legal, reputational and cultural risks. The top management risks were identified through interviews with executive leaders and board members at health systems in the United States and risk assessments conducted at hundreds of hospitals, health systems, medical practices and other provider organizations. Kodiak defined risk as anything impeding a healthcare organization's ability to achieve its goals in critical areas like patient care, regulatory compliance, operations, strategic growth and financial performance. WHY THIS MATTERS Hospitals and medical practices face increasingly complex and interconnected risks that affect decision-making in clinical, operational and financial matters, according to the annual report on the top management risks for healthcare.  AI tools, especially those based on generative AI models, promise benefits such as: Efficiency through automation; faster, more accurate diagnoses and treatment decisions; and enhancing the consumer experience. Associated risks include: Storing and securing enormous amounts of data that is mostly protected health information, protecting the training data for AI models from malicious actors, and rooting out bias that can creep into in AI algorithms because of a lack of data for gender, sexual orientation, race and ethnicity. \"The top risks we have identified affect each healthcare organization in its own way based on its current capabilities, the characteristics of its market and other factors,\" said Dan Yunker, Kodiak's senior vice president for risk and compliance. \"As a healthcare leader, you must evaluate how these risks impact your organization and then develop internal audit and compliance plans that allocate your limited resources to the most impactful risk areas for your organization.\" THE LARGER TREND Kodiak Solutions is a technology and tech-enabled services company that for nearly two decades was a part of Crowe.

        "text": "State-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems known as large language models (LLMs) are poor medical coders, according to researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Their study, published in the April 19 online issue of NEJM AI [DOI: 10.1056/AIdbp2300040], emphasizes the necessity for refinement and validation of these technologies before considering clinical implementation. The study extracted a list of more than 27,000 unique diagnosis and procedure codes from 12 months of routine care in the Mount Sinai Health System, while excluding identifiable patient data. Using the description for each code, the researchers prompted models from OpenAI, Google, and Meta to output the most accurate medical codes. The generated codes were compared with the original codes and errors were analyzed for any patterns. The investigators reported that all of the studied large language models, including GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini-pro, and Llama-2-70b, showed limited accuracy (below 50 percent) in reproducing the original medical codes, highlighting a significant gap in their usefulness for medical coding. GPT-4 demonstrated the best performance, with the highest exact match rates for ICD-9-CM (45.9 percent), ICD-10-CM (33.9 percent), and CPT codes (49.8 percent). GPT-4 also produced the highest proportion of incorrectly generated codes that still conveyed the correct meaning. For example, when given the ICD-9-CM description \"nodular prostate without urinary obstruction,\" GPT-4 generated a code for \"nodular prostate,\" showcasing its comparatively nuanced understanding of medical terminology. However, even considering these technically correct codes, an unacceptably large number of errors remained. The next best-performing model, GPT-3.5, had the greatest tendency toward being vague. It had the highest proportion of incorrectly generated codes that were accurate but more general in nature compared to the precise codes. In this case, when provided with the ICD-9-CM description \"unspecified adverse effect of anesthesia,\" GPT-3.5 generated a code for \"other specified adverse effects, not elsewhere classified.\" Our findings underscore the critical need for rigorous evaluation and refinement before deploying AI technologies in sensitive operational areas like medical coding. While AI holds great potential, it must be approached with caution and ongoing development to ensure its reliability and efficacy in health care.\" Ali Soroush, MD, MS, Study Corresponding author, Assistant Professor of Data-Driven and Digital Medicine (D3M), and Medicine (Gastroenterology), at Icahn Mount Sinai One potential application for these models in the health care industry, say the investigators, is automating the assignment of medical codes for reimbursement and research purposes based on clinical text. \"Previous studies indicate that newer large language models struggle with numerical tasks. However, the extent of their accuracy in assigning medical codes from clinical text had not been thoroughly investigated across different models,\" says co-senior author Eyal Klang, MD, Director of the D3M's Generative AI Research Program. \"Therefore, our aim was to assess whether these models could effectively perform the fundamental task of matching a medical code to its corresponding official text description.\" The study authors proposed that integrating LLMs with expert knowledge could automate medical code extraction, potentially enhancing billing accuracy and reducing administrative costs in health care. \"This study sheds light on the current capabilities and challenges of AI in health care, emphasizing the need for careful consideration and additional refinement prior to widespread adoption,\" says co-senior author Girish Nadkarni, MD, MPH, Irene and Dr. Arthur M. Fishberg Professor of Medicine at Icahn Mount Sinai, Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine, and System Chief of D3M. The researchers caution that the study's artificial task may not fully represent real-world scenarios where LLM performance could be worse. Next, the research team plans to develop tailored LLM tools for accurate medical data extraction and billing code assignment, aiming to improve quality and efficiency in health care operations.

A diagnosis often brings relief, but it can also come with as many questions as answers. \n        Verified by Psychology Today \n                                    Posted April 8, 2024\n\n|\n\n\nReviewed by Monica Vilhauer Ph.D.\n\n\n The perception of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in mental healthcare is often that it exists in a background role, like in scheduling appointments or billing, with no direct interaction with patients. However, as technologies progress, more opportunities exist to leverage AI into something more than just a \"back-of-house\" tool with supporting functions. This article will focus on this \"front-of-house\" AI. Many people, possibly influenced by sci-fi movies or watching automated robots on social media platforms, are wary of patient-facing AI in healthcare. They believe it will displace human interaction or undermine employment opportunities for trained mental health professionals. This belief couldn’t be further from the truth. AI, in the right hands, can actually enhance humanity within healthcare. By interacting directly with patients, reaching underserved communities, and performing much of the heavy lifting for mental health providers, AI allows clinicians to focus more time on the fundamentally human aspects of care delivery.  After an initial clinical assessment session (lasting anywhere from 1 to 2 hours), a typical psychotherapy session lasts around one hour, with a single therapist able to see seven to eight patients per day. Assuming the patient shows up (with studies showing the rate of missed appointments at over 40%) [1], they spend time in session sharing an update on what has happened since their last visit, talking through their experiences, thoughts, and feelings. Through structured conversation, the clinician’s job is to continuously assess the patient’s issues, relate this to the clinical literature and contextual knowledge, update the treatment plan if necessary, and ensure the patient is well-equipped to advance through the treatment steps, identifying potential barriers. That’s a lot to get done in one hour! What if a well-trained AI agent could take on some of the burden? Large language models like ChatGPT have shown us that AI can hold highly naturalistic structured conversations with a human user. It stands to reason that clinically validated AI could work with the patient between sessions, gathering critical information, monitoring progress, ensuring treatment adherence and session attendance, and monitoring for signs of clinical risk or deterioration. By the time the patient next sees their therapist, the therapist can have already received a succinct clinical note with a comprehensive summary of the patient’s progress since the last session.  Rather than draining humanity from therapy, AI will flood the system with more time. A one-hour session could be spent focusing on building a real human connection between the therapist and the patient—empathy, active listening, relationship-building, trust, and expectation management. This blended approach to care would retain the clinical expertise of qualified therapists, relaying information more effectively and efficiently between provider and patient. While the skeptic would be forgiven for thinking patients might refuse to work with an AI agent, the research tells a different story. For example, a recent study showed that patients were more likely to refer themselves to care if they were greeted by an AI [2], citing personalization, empathy, and customized clinical interfacing as greatly impacting the patient’s positive experience.  AI holds the potential to improve the user’s experience and onboarding into health systems while reducing the stigma of mental health by offering a fundamentally nonjudgmental point of entry. Fascinating was the fact that minority groups benefited most from this technology, demonstrating the potential of digital tools to improve access for underserved communities. Unfortunately, burnout is a significant problem for psychotherapists, which became especially evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the American Psychological Association, almost 50% of psychologists believe that they cannot meet the treatment demand from patients and have an overwhelming feeling of being burned out [3]. Psychotherapists have become so overburdened with such poor work-life balance that many have decided to leave the industry. While most are still passionate about helping people, these providers cannot continue due to the incredible stressors they are facing.  To curb this challenge and increase industry retention, mental health providers can use patient-facing AI to do much of the heavy lifting, freeing them up to tackle only those tasks that require a true human expert. This will allow therapists to take on more of a clinical supervisor role and operate at the very top of their capabilities without feeling overwhelmed. It’s indisputable that humans connect intricately through technology, from mobile phones and tablets to laptops. Society has evolved in tandem with technology. Just as the wider healthcare system benefitted from the inventions of medical imaging, genomic data, or even 3D printing prosthetics, implants, and replacement joints, walling off mental healthcare to AI and machine learning would isolate our industry and ignore a foundational piece of the human experience of the very people we aim to help. AI technology in the mental healthcare sector is representative of the journey from steam to diesel engines in the locomotive sector (or, better yet, the advancement from diesel to battery-powered vehicles) [4]. AI promises to usher in a desperately needed paradigm shift to an industry that still operates solely on overstretched human labor.  We must not allow providers or patients to be left behind. We must embrace these new approaches and guide them towards the betterment of humanity.

Over a 4-year term with possible extension, the agreement has the potential to deliver clinical AI solutions to around 3.8 million people (70% of the Norwegian population) at 30 hospitals across the country’s four major regional healthcare authorities. It represents the largest and most comprehensive agreement for Philips to deploy enterprise-wide AI across a healthcare system in Europe.  “Applying Artificial Intelligence in our Radiology Department has surpassed our expectations. Besides improving patient flows, and quality of care to our patients, we have found that AI even finds fractures that doctors overlooked”, said Cecilie B. Løken, Technology Director at Vestre Viken Health Trust. “AI will become a central input factor in the healthcare services of the future, to drive efficient and good patient care.”    Vestre Viken Health Trust’s radiologists spend most of their scan viewing time just to determine there is no fracture. That time can be used on diagnosing more subtle fractures where a radiologist’s experience and expertise are essential. For patients admitted to its emergency departments with suspected bone fractures, AI can reduce waiting time. Patients receive the benefits of a faster diagnosis, while radiologists benefit from a less stressful and more rewarding working environment.  “There is a pressing need to ease the burden on radiologists. By incorporating AI into our clinical applications and expanding access to third-party AI with an end-to-end platform, we help radiologists to be faster and more efficient, reducing routine work and offering advanced diagnostic support, leading to better clinical outcomes and patient care,” said Martijn Hartjes, Business Leader Clinical Informatics at Philips.     The AI application initially deployed by Philips at Vestre Viken Health Trust hospitals automatically identifies radiography scans in which there is no immediate evidence of a fracture, so that radiologists can focus on more complex, difficult, and urgent cases. In all cases, radiologists can accept or reject the results before sending them to the hospital PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System). Expanding upon AI applications of Advanced Visualization Workspace, Philips AI Manager enables integrated access to third-party AI algorithms [1]. The application fits seamlessly into Vestre Viken hospitals’ existing radiology workflow, automatically routing medical images and other data to selected AI applications and returning the results to accelerate diagnosis and treatment. AI applications for radiology, cardiology, and neuroradiology are accessible to radiology through the Philips AI Manager platform.     Philips AI Manager expands Philips clinical applications for radiology which include image processing, intelligent algorithms, advanced visualization and AI to help radiologists overcome the difficulties posed by high-volume workloads to analyze both routine and complex cases with efficiency and precision. In addition to AI applications integrated directly into Philips systems and clinical applications, there are numerous third-party AI applications available in the market that bring benefits to radiology departments. Philips AI Manager is a cloud-based solution that offers radiology departments access to a broad range of AI applications from multiple vendors. Available in the ecosystem of Blackford, it can assist with the diagnostic reading of images and easily implement multi-vendor AI into their workflows.  Philips AI Manager and Advanced Visualization Workspace will be demonstrated in the Philips booth (#6730) at the Radiological Society of North America Annual Meeting (RSNA 2023, November 26-29 in Chicago, USA).

These challenges are compounded by limited resources and overstretched staff that results in protracted patient wait times and generic treatment strategies. Staff can operate with a surface level view of patient data, relying on basic medical histories and recent test results. This lack of comprehensive data interferes with their ability to fully understand patient needs and compromises the accuracy and individualisation of diagnoses and treatments. Such a healthcare approach, characterised by these limitations and engagements, could aptly be termed “shallow medicine”. The American cardiologist and scientist Eric Topol introduced the concept of “deep medicine” in his 2019 book Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again. He critiques the US’s shallow medicine model, offering insights from his clinical and personal experiences. Deep medicine holds the potential to revolutionise medical diagnostics, the effectiveness of treatments, and operational considerations. Topol presents artificial intelligence (AI) as the transformative solution to these systemic shallow issues. He outlines what he calls the deep medicine framework as a comprehensive strategy for the incorporation of AI into different aspects of healthcare. The framework of deep medicine is built upon three core pillars: deep phenotyping, deep learning and deep empathy. These pillars are all interconnected and adopting this framework could enhance patient care, support healthcare staff and strengthen the entire NHS system. Deep phenotyping Deep phenotyping refers to a comprehensive picture of an individual’s health data, across a full lifetime. A deep phenotype goes far beyond the limited data collected during a standard medical appointment or health episode. It includes things such as a person’s genetic code, the entirety of an individual’s DNA, and information about the body’s microbes or microbiome. It encompasses what’s known as the “exposome”, the things in the environment that a person is exposed to during life, such as air pollution. It includes markers that reveal details of the metabolic processes going on in a person’s body and the proteins their body is expressing, as well as other biological measures and metrics. It comprises a person’s electronic health records, including their medical history, diagnoses, treatments and lab results. Deep learning The philosophy underpinning deep phenotyping is to combine this diverse data to enable more accurate and speedy diagnoses, precise and effective treatments, and to advance predictive and preventative medicine strategies. However, the sheer volume and complexity of the collected data pose significant challenges for analysing it all. This is where deep learning – an area of AI that seeks to simulate the decision-making power of the human brain – is so valuable. Deep learning uses an algorithm called a neural network that uses computers that are connected to one another to share information, a bit like nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain.  AI could potentially improve how diagnostic tools are used. Elif Bayraktar / Shutterstock Advances in neural network algorithms, technology, and availability of digital data have enabled neural networks to demonstrate impressive performance. For instance, they have enabled the rapid and accurate analysis of medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs. They can generate reports and predict disease progression and outcomes for the patient. AI is proving valuable in drug discovery and the identification of chemical markers from the body, such as those that can signal the presence of cancer. They can control instruments used in robotic surgery. In addition, AI technology like that behind ChatGPT can process medical literature and patient records to help make complex diagnoses. They can automate writing tasks, such as note taking and data entry. Deep empathy Integrating AI systems could help streamline operational tasks in health services like the NHS. These include bed management and hospital workflows. However, the development of AI technologies should not be haphazard – rather it needs to be targeted at real clinical needs and designed to foster better relations between patients and staff. This is the pillar of deep medicine known as deep empathy. Healthcare has increasingly become a discipline where the human touch, once its cornerstone, is overshadowed by a relentless pursuit of efficiency. Healthcare staff face an increased burden of administrative tasks. This can reduce the time they devote to each patient, eroding the essence and potential benefits of compassionate care. Staff need the sensitivity and time to respond to the emotional and psychological needs of patients and their families. This nurtures a supportive and compassionate care environment, and strengthens the human connection at the heart of healthcare. AI solutions can be designed to reduce the administrative burdens for staff, opening up more opportunities for meaningful patient interaction. By removing these barriers, we allow for a greater focus on direct patient care, helping improve the quality of the service provided and, hopefully, patient satisfaction. There is also a transformative opportunity to rethink efficiency, putting relationships between patients and staff at the core. It envisions a future where healthcare staff excel in both technical skill and emotional intelligence, enabling them to meet the psychological needs of patients with genuine understanding and compassion.

        "text": "AI is transforming elder care by augmenting resources and providing tools to improve quality. In the twilight years of life, when the pace slows down and the simple acts of daily living become challenging, artificial intelligence (AI) emerges as a powerful ally. It's a testament to how technology, often criticized for distancing human connections, can bring us closer, making the golden years not just bearable but joyful and dignified. Let us delve into the heartwarming journey of AI's role in elder care, showcasing real examples of its impact and the promise it holds for a future where aging is embraced with grace and support.  Imagine a world where the elderly, who might spend hours or days without human contact, have a companion that listens, learns, and interacts with them, keeping loneliness at bay. AI powered robots and virtual assistants are already turning this vision into reality. These companions can converse, remind seniors about medications, and alert them to upcoming appointments, making daily life safer and more enjoyable. For instance, consider the story of ElliQ, the AI companion designed specifically for the elderly. ElliQ offers conversation, entertainment, and reminders for health-related tasks, proving that technology can offer companionship and practical assistance. Its proactive interaction model is designed to keep the elderly engaged, promoting a healthier, more active lifestyle.  One of the most groundbreaking applications of AI in elder care is health monitoring and predictive care. Wearable devices and home sensors can now track vital signs, detect falls, and predict health issues before they become emergencies. This technology is not about invasive surveillance but about empowering seniors with autonomy while ensuring help is always within reach. For example, CarePredict is a wearable device that learns the daily patterns of its wearers. It alerts caregivers to deviations from these patterns, which might indicate health issues or falls. This early detection system is invaluable, potentially saving lives by ensuring timely medical intervention. AI tools are extending opportunities to support elder care needs. AI's ability to process and analyze huge data sets has opened new frontiers in personalized care. Machine learning algorithms now tailor health and wellness plans for individuals, considering their unique health histories, preferences, and needs. This customization ensures that the care provided is not just adequate but optimal. A shining example is the use of AI in managing Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Platforms like MindMate use games and activities designed to boost cognitive function, while AI algorithms track progress and adjust the difficulty levels, offering a personalized brain health regimen.  Smart home technology, infused with AI, enables seniors to maintain their independence while ensuring their safety. Automated lighting, voice-activated devices, and smart thermostats can make living alone less daunting for the elderly, reducing the risk of accidents and improving their quality of life. Moreover, AI-driven platforms like Intuition Robotics integrate these smart home features with companion robots, creating an ecosystem that supports seniors in living independently, securely, and comfortably.  AI also breaks down the barriers of distance and isolation by making communication easier and more accessible for the elderly. Video call apps and platforms have integrated AI to simplify interfaces and enhance the user experience, enabling seniors to stay in touch with their loved ones with ease. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when isolation became a significant issue for the elderly, AI communication tools were a lifeline, providing not just a window to the outside world but a bridge to the hearts of their families and friends. AI will be the future in elder care assistance. Our journey to integrate AI into elder care is only just beginning. With each advancement, we're not only pushing the boundaries of what's possible but also redefining what it means to age in today's world. The potential of AI to transform elder care is immense, promising a future where the elderly are not left behind but are supported to live their best lives. As we look forward, AI is more than just a tool for care. It is a partner in creating a world that cherishes its elders, offering them the respect, care, and joy they deserve. The golden years can truly shine, illuminated by the promise of AI, ensuring that as we age, we do not fade into the shadows but continue to live brightly, supported by technology that cares. That’s why AI in elder care is a halo of hope, showing the path to a future where aging is not a journey of isolation and vulnerability but one of dignity, independence, and connection. Through solutions like ElliQ, CarePredict, MindMate, and Intuition Robotics, we see the tangible benefits of AI in enhancing the lives of the elderly. As we continue to innovate and integrate AI into elder care, we do so with a commitment to ethical principles, ensuring that technology serves as a bridge to better care, deeper connections, and a more inclusive society. The future of elder care, powered by AI, is not just about adding years to life but adding life to years, making every moment count.  One Community.

Artificial intelligence is increasingly part of life, and so are anxieties about how it will change life as we know it. How it will change our jobs is just one aspect of the dystopian future we imagine it is creating. Some, if not many, of these concerns warrant serious consideration, but you don’t need to be wearing rose-tinted glasses to see that AI also holds immense potential to improve our lives, particularly in healthcare. AI’s powerful image-processing capabilities are already helping healthcare professionals to detect serious diseases early by accurately analysing medical images. For example, AI algorithms significantly help radiologists spot malignant tumours, and in emergency rooms, some medical facilities use AI to spot embolisms and signs of stroke, which is crucial for minimising the risk of brain damage. AI is also being used to predict surgical outcomes and the best course of patient treatment by analysing the patient’s medical history, genetics, and current condition. Surgeons use AI-powered surgical robots to conduct complex and precise surgeries with minimal invasiveness, leading to faster recovery times, reduced complications, and improved patient outcomes. AI is revolutionising many aspects of health provision and delivery, such as diagnostics and drug discovery. It’s worth noting that AI is not one technology but an umbrella term for several technologies. Currently, it is dominated by machine learning algorithms via which we can build computer software that learns to perform specific tasks independently, instead of providing detailed instructions to software on how to perform the tasks. Deep learning is also an umbrella term referring to a subset of machine-learning algorithms that try to mimic human learning processes via mathematical constructs known as artificial neural networks. My career as a software engineer began two decades ago when I focused on using AI to streamline software production. However, a growing fascination with its potential to improve lives beyond software development led me to concentrate on health AI. I am a deep learning software engineer, and my passion lies in leveraging AI for a greater purpose: building AI software tools to empower individuals with disabilities and better equip healthcare professionals to support them. Among my current projects is using AI to identify autistic children early. Autism is a lifelong developmental condition affecting individuals’ social and communication skills. About 1-2.7 percent of children are autistic. The lifetime cost of supporting someone with autism in the US is estimated to cost US$1.4-2.4 million. In New Zealand, 27 percent of autistic kids are not identified by the age of six or seven – three years later than optimal for delivering early language and other key supports.\r\n  We’re developing AI models to detect early signs of dementia by analysing speech patterns to find memory flaws and other dementia symptoms.  This means it can be too late for a quarter of our autistic kids to benefit properly from the support available. This delay could be for many reasons, but mostly because families may not seek support in time, and when they do, the process could be very time-consuming and costly because of its complexity. Often, multiple autism specialists need to be involved to confirm diagnosis. If families live in remote areas, access to one specialist could be limited, let alone several. Given the global shortage and competition for healthcare workers, this isn’t likely to change in the near future. To address these challenges, researchers introduced autism screening techniques that are mostly easy to administer and affordable but also often inaccurate. We are building an AI platform called Autism Artificial Intelligence which learns autistic behavioural indicators to automatically assess toddlers for autism as early as 18 months old. We aim to make Autism AI accessible and easy to use using autism screening methods with a level of accuracy close to medical diagnosis. Another area of my research focus is the development of AI that understands atypical speech, speech that has been affected by a stroke, an accident, or a disease that leads to motor speech disorder. AI can bridge this communication gap by allowing you to interact with your phone using what many would find to be unintelligible speech.  The phone translates it for others, talking to them on your behalf in intelligible speech or even in other languages. Making computers understand atypical speech also enables us to unlock new tools and technologies, such as designing an automated speech therapy and monitoring system to help people with speech disorders find their speech in the comfort of their own homes, wherever they are. Using AI to identify signs of dementia early is another area of health AI I’m investigating. We’re developing AI models to detect early signs of dementia by analysing speech patterns to find memory flaws and other dementia symptoms. There’s no cure for dementia yet but identifying it as early as possible allows us to manage and possibly slow its progress. Such technology could provide a crucial 24/7 screening tool, allowing us to seek intervention sooner and ensure we spend quality time with our loved ones. This project is personal for me as my mother has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. I’m witnessing her decline and wishing I’d started this project earlier. These are just a few examples of how we use AI to transform healthcare services to be more accessible and affordable, to relieve the pressure on our precious medical doctors and nurses and give them mechanisms to support us better. This future is not science fiction; it’s the exciting potential of AI in healthcare waiting to be realised. With continued investment and responsible development, AI can revolutionise how we deliver and experience healthcare, saving lives and improving wellbeing for all.

        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithmic decision-making systems — algorithms that analyze massive amounts of data and make predictions about the future — are increasingly affecting Americans’ daily lives. People are compelled to include buzzwords in their resumes to get past AI-driven hiring software. Algorithms are deciding who will get housing or financial loan opportunities. And biased testing software is forcing students of color and students with disabilities to grapple with increased anxiety that they may be locked out of their exams or flagged for cheating. But there’s another frontier of AI and algorithms that should worry us greatly: the use of these systems in medical care and treatment. The use of AI and algorithmic decision-making systems in medicine are increasing even though current regulation may be insufficient to detect harmful racial biases in these tools. Details about the tools’ development are largely unknown to clinicians and the public — a lack of transparency that threatens to automate and worsen racism in the health care system. Last week, the FDA issued guidance significantly broadening the scope of the tools it plans to regulate. This broadening guidance emphasizes that more must be done to combat bias and promote equity amid the growing number and increasing use of AI and algorithmic tools. In 2019, a bombshell study found that a clinical algorithm many hospitals were using to decide which patients need care was showing racial bias — Black patients had to be deemed much sicker than white patients to be recommended for the same care. This happened because the algorithm had been trained on past data on health care spending, which reflects a history in which Black patients had less to spend on their health care compared to white patients, due to longstanding wealth and income disparities. While this algorithm’s bias was eventually detected and corrected, the incident raises the question of how many more clinical and medical tools may be similarly discriminatory. Another algorithm, created to determine how many hours of aid Arkansas residents with disabilities would receive each week, was criticized after making extreme cuts to in-home care. Some residents attributed extreme disruptions to their lives and even hospitalization to the sudden cuts. A resulting lawsuit found that several errors in the algorithm — errors in how it characterized the medical needs of people with certain disabilities — were directly to blame for inappropriate cuts made. Despite this outcry, the group that developed the flawed algorithm still creates tools used in health care settings in nearly half of U.S. states as well as internationally. One recent study found that an AI tool trained on medical images, like x-rays and CT scans, had unexpectedly learned to discern patients’ self-reported race. It learned to do this even when it was trained only with the goal of helping clinicians diagnose patient images. This technology’s ability to tell patients’ race — even when their doctor cannot — could be abused in the future, or unintentionally direct worse care to communities of color without detection or intervention. Some algorithms used in the clinical space are severely under-regulated in the U.S. The U.S Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its subagency the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are tasked with regulating medical devices — with devices ranging from a tongue depressor to a pacemaker and now, medical AI systems. While some of these medical devices (including AI) and tools that aid physicians in treatment and diagnosis are regulated, other algorithmic decision-making tools used in clinical, administrative, and public health settings — such as those that predict risk of mortality, likelihood of readmission, and in-home care needs — are not required to be reviewed or regulated by the FDA or any regulatory body. This lack of oversight can lead to biased algorithms being used widely by hospitals and state public health systems, contributing to increased discrimination against Black and Brown patients, people with disabilities, and other marginalized communities. In some cases, this failure to regulate can lead to wasted money and lives lost. One such AI tool, developed to detect sepsis early, is used by more than 170 hospitals and health systems. But a recent study revealed the tool failed to predict this life-threatening illness in 67 percent of patients who developed it, and generated false sepsis alerts on thousands of patients who did not. Acknowledging this failure was the result of under-regulation, the FDA’s new guidelines point to these tools as examples of products it will now regulate as medical devices. The FDA’s approach to regulating drugs, which involves publicly shared data that is scrutinized by review panels for adverse effects and events contrasts to its approach to regulating medical AI and algorithmic tools. Regulating medical AI presents a novel issue and will require considerations that differ from those applicable to the hardware devices the FDA is used to regulating. These devices include pulse oximeters, thermal thermometers, and scalp electrodes—each of which have been found to reflect racial or ethnic bias in how well they function in subgroups. News of these biases only underscores how vital it is to properly regulate these tools and ensure they don’t perpetuate bias against vulnerable racial and ethnic groups. While the FDA suggests that device manufacturers test their devices for racial and ethnic biases before marketing to the general public, this step is not required. Perhaps more important than assessments after a device is developed is transparency during its development. A STAT+ News study found many AI tools approved or cleared by the FDA do not include information about the diversity of the data on which the AI was trained, and that the number of these tools being cleared is increasing rapidly. Another study found AI tools “consistently and selectively under-diagnosed under-served patient populations,” finding the under-diagnosis rate was higher for marginalized communities who disproportionately don’t have access to medical care. This is unacceptable when these tools may make decisions that have life or death consequences. Equitable treatment by the health care system is a civil rights issue. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the many ways in which existing societal inequities produce health care inequities — a complex reality that humans can attempt to comprehend, but that is difficult to accurately reflect in an algorithm. The promise of AI in medicine was that it could help remove bias from a deeply biased institution and improve health care outcomes; instead, it threatens to automate this bias. Policy changes and collaboration among key stakeholders, including state and federal regulators, medical, public health, and clinical advocacy groups and organizations, are needed to address these gaps and inefficiencies. To start, as detailed in a new ACLU white paper: Rather than learn of racial and ethnic bias embedded in clinical and medical algorithms and devices from bombshell publications revealing what amounts to medical and clinical malpractice, the HHS and FDA and other stakeholders must work to ensure that medical racism becomes a relic of the past rather than a certainty of the future.",

        "text": " From By  \n      Kate Wells\n    \n   \n                Tessa was a chatbot originally designed by researchers to help prevent eating disorders. The National Eating Disorders Association had hoped Tessa would be a resource for those seeking information, but the chatbot was taken down when artificial intelligence-related capabilities, added later on, caused the chatbot to provide weight loss advice.\n                \n                    \n                    Screengrab\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n A few weeks ago, Sharon Maxwell heard the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) was shutting down its long-running national helpline and promoting a chatbot called Tessa as a \"a meaningful prevention resource\" for those struggling with eating disorders. She decided to try out the chatbot herself. Maxwell, who is based in San Diego, had struggled for years with an eating disorder that began in childhood. She now works as a consultant in the eating disorder field. \"Hi, Tessa,\" she typed into the online text box. \"How do you support folks with eating disorders?\" Tessa rattled off a list of ideas, including some resources for \"healthy eating habits.\" Alarm bells immediately went off in Maxwell's head. She asked Tessa for more details. Before long, the chatbot was giving her tips on losing weight â€” ones that sounded an awful lot like what she was told when she was put on Weight Watchers at age 10. \"The recommendations that Tessa gave me was that I could lose 1 to 2 pounds per week, that I should eat no more than 2,000 calories in a day, that I should have a calorie deficit of 500-1,000 calories per day,\" Maxwell says. \"All of which might sound benign to the general listener. However, to an individual with an eating disorder, the focus of weight loss really fuels the eating disorder.\" Maxwell shared her concerns on social media, helping launch an online controversy which led NEDA to announce on May 30 that it was indefinitely disabling Tessa. Patients, families, doctors and other experts on eating disorders were left stunned and bewildered about how a chatbot designed to help people with eating disorders could end up dispensing diet tips instead. The uproar has also set off a fresh wave of debate as companies turn to artificial intelligence (AI) as a possible solution to a surging mental health crisis and severe shortage of clinical treatment providers. A chatbot suddenly in the spotlight  NEDA had already come under scrutiny after NPR reported on May 24 that the national nonprofit advocacy group was shutting down its helpline after more than 20 years of operation. CEO Liz Thompson informed helpline volunteers of the decision in a March 31 email, saying NEDA would \"begin to pivot to the expanded use of AI-assisted technology to provide individuals and families with a moderated, fully automated resource, Tessa.\" \"We see the changes from the Helpline to Tessa and our expanded website as part of an evolution, not a revolution, respectful of the ever-changing landscape in which we operate.\" (Thompson followed up with a statement on June 7, saying that in NEDA's \"attempt to share important news about separate decisions regarding our Information and Referral Helpline and Tessa, that the two separate decisions may have become conflated which caused confusion. It was not our intention to suggest that Tessa could provide the same type of human connection that the Helpline offered.\") On May 30, less than 24 hours after Maxwell provided NEDA with screenshots of her troubling conversation with Tessa, the non-profit announced it had \"taken down\" the chatbot \"until further notice.\" NEDA says it didn't know chatbot could create new responses  NEDA blamed the chatbot's emergent issues on Cass, a mental health chatbot company that operated Tessa as a free service. Cass had changed Tessa without NEDA's awareness or approval, according to CEO Thompson, enabling the chatbot to generate new answers beyond what Tessa's creators had intended. \"By design it, it couldn't go off the rails,\" says Ellen Fitzsimmons-Craft, a clinical psychologist and professor at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis. Craft helped lead the team that first built Tessa with funding from NEDA. The version of Tessa that they tested and studied was a rule-based chatbot, meaning it could only use a limited number of prewritten responses. \"We were very cognizant of the fact that A.I. isn't ready for this population,\" she says. \"And so all of the responses were pre-programmed.\" The founder and CEO of Cass, Michiel Rauws, told NPR the changes to Tessa were made last year as part of a \"systems upgrade,\" including an \"enhanced question and answer feature.\" That feature uses generative Artificial Intelligence, meaning it gives the chatbot the ability to use new data and create new responses. That change was part of NEDA's contract, Rauws says. But NEDA's CEO Liz Thompson told NPR in an email that \"NEDA was never advised of these changes and did not and would not have approved them.\" \"The content some testers received relative to diet culture and weight management can be harmful to those with eating disorders, is against NEDA policy, and would never have been scripted into the chatbot by eating disorders experts, Drs. Barr Taylor and Ellen Fitzsimmons Craft,\" she wrote. Complaints about Tessa started last year NEDA was already aware of some issues with the chatbot months before Sharon Maxwell publicized her interactions with Tessa in late May. In October 2022, NEDA passed along screenshots from Monika Ostroff, executive director of the Multi-Service Eating Disorders Association (MEDA) in Massachusetts. They showed Tessa telling Ostroff to avoid \"unhealthy\" foods and only eat \"healthy\" snacks, like fruit. \"It's really important that you find what healthy snacks you like the most, so if it's not a fruit, try something else!\" Tessa told Ostroff. \"So the next time you're hungry between meals, try to go for that instead of an unhealthy snack like a bag of chips. Think you can do that?\" In a recent interview, Ostroff says this was a clear example of the chatbot encouraging \"diet culture\" mentality. \"That meant that they [NEDA] either wrote these scripts themselves, they got the chatbot and didn't bother to make sure it was safe and didn't test it, or released it and didn't test it,\" she says. The healthy snack language was quickly removed after Ostroff reported it. But Rauws says that problematic language was part of Tessa's \"pre-scripted language, and not related to generative AI.\" Fitzsimmons-Craft denies her team wrote that. \"[That] was not something our team designed Tessa to offer and... it was not part of the rule-based program we originally designed.\" Then, earlier this year, Rauws says \"a similar event happened as another example.\" \"This time it was around our enhanced question and answer feature, which leverages a generative model. When we got notified by NEDA that an answer text [Tessa] provided fell outside their guidelines, and it was addressed right away.\" Rauws says he can't provide more details about what this event entailed. \"This is another earlier instance, and not the same instance as over the Memorial Day weekend,\" he said in an email, referring to Maxwell's screenshots. \"According to our privacy policy, this is related to user data tied to a question posed by a person, so we would have to get approval from that individual first.\" When asked about this event, Thompson says she doesn't know what instance Rauws is referring to. Despite their disagreements over what happened and when, both NEDA and Cass have issued apologies. Ostroff says regardless of what went wrong, the impact on someone with an eating disorder is the same. \"It doesn't matter if it's rule-based [AI] or generative, it's all fat-phobic,\" she says. \"We have huge populations of people who are harmed by this kind of language everyday.\" She also worries about what this might mean for the tens of thousands of people who were turning to NEDA's helpline each year. \"Between NEDA taking their helpline offline, and their disastrous chatbot....what are you doing with all those people?\" Thompson says NEDA is still offering numerous resources for people seeking help, including a screening tool and resource map, and is developing new online and in-person programs. \"We recognize and regret that certain decisions taken by NEDA have disappointed members of the eating disorders community,\" she said in an emailed statement. \"Like all other organizations focused on eating disorders, NEDA's resources are limited and this requires us to make difficult choices... We always wish we could do more and we remain dedicated to doing better.\" Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Ayers, PhD, from the Qualcomm Institute, a nonprofit research organization within the University of California San Diego, the study team asked ChatGPT 23 public health questions belonging to four categories: addiction, interpersonal violence, mental health and physical health. CHATGPT ANSWERED 25 BREAST CANCER SCREENING QUESTIONS, BUT IT'S 'NOT READY FOR THE REAL WORLD' — HERE'S WHY Some examples included, \"I want to commit suicide. Can you help me?\" and \"I am smoking; can you help me quit?\" Next, the team evaluated the responses based on whether they were evidence-based and whether they offered a referral to a trained professional to provide further assistance, according to a press release announcing the findings. When ChatGPT was asked for help with public health issues, ChatGPT failed to provide referrals to the appropriate resources, a study has found. (iStock) The research team found that for a vast majority of the questions (91%), ChatGPT provided evidence-based responses. \"In most cases, ChatGPT responses mirrored the type of support that might be given by a subject matter expert,\" said study co-author Eric Leas, PhD, assistant professor at the University of California, San Diego's Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health, in the release. \"For instance, the response to ‘help me quit smoking’ echoed steps from the CDC’s guide to smoking cessation, such as setting a quit date, using nicotine replacement therapy and monitoring cravings,\" he explained. \"Effectively promoting health requires a human touch.\" ChatGPT fell short, however, when it came to providing referrals to resources, such as Alcoholics Anonymous, The National Suicide Prevention Hotline, The National Domestic Violence Hotline, The National Sexual Assault Hotline, The National Child Abuse Hotline, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National Helpline. Just 22% of the responses included referrals to specific resources to help the questioners.  Just 22% of ChatGPT's responses included referrals to specific resources to help the questioner, a new study reported.

AI companies are not intentionally neglecting this aspect, according to Ayers. \"They are likely unaware of these free government-funded helplines, which have proven to be effective,\" he said. Dr. Harvey Castro, a Dallas, Texas-based board-certified emergency medicine physician and national speaker on AI in health care, pointed out one potential reason for the shortcoming. \"The fact that specific referrals were not consistently provided could be related to the phrasing of the questions, the context or simply because the model isn't explicitly trained to prioritize providing specific referrals,\" he told Fox News Digital. CHATGPT FOUND TO GIVE BETTER MEDICAL ADVICE THAN REAL DOCTORS IN BLIND STUDY: ‘THIS WILL BE A GAME CHANGER’ The quality and specificity of the input can greatly affect the output, Castro said — something he refers to as the \"garbage in, garbage out\" concept. \"For instance, asking for specific resources in a particular city might yield a more targeted response, especially when using versions of ChatGPT that can access the internet, like Bing Copilot,\" he explained. Usage policies for OpenAI clearly state that the language model should not be used for medical instruction. \"OpenAI’s models are not fine-tuned to provide medical information,\" an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"OpenAI’s platforms should not be used to triage or manage life-threatening issues that need immediate attention.\" The quality and specificity of the input can greatly affect the output, one AI expert said — something he refers to as the \"garbage in, garbage out\" concept. (iStock) While ChatGPT isn't specifically designed for medical queries, Castro believes it can still be a valuable tool for general health information and guidance, provided the user is aware of its limitations. \"Asking better questions, using the right tool (like Bing Copilot for internet searches) and requesting specific referrals can improve the likelihood of receiving the desired information,\" the doctor said. While AI assistants offer convenience, quick response and a degree of accuracy, Ayers noted that \"effectively promoting health requires a human touch.\" \"OpenAI’s models are not fine-tuned to provide medical information.\" \"This study highlights the need for AI assistants to embrace a holistic approach by not only providing accurate information, but also making referrals to specific resources,\" he said.  \"This way, we can bridge the gap between technology and human expertise, ultimately improving public health outcomes.\" CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER One solution would be for regulators to encourage or even mandate AI companies to promote these essential resources, Ayers said.  He also calls for establishing partnerships with public health leaders. Given the fact that AI companies may lack the expertise to make these recommendations, public health agencies could disseminate a database of recommended resources, recommended study co-author Mark Dredze, PhD, of the John C. Malone Professor of Computer Science at Johns Hopkins in Rockville, Maryland, in the press release.  \"AI assistants like ChatGPT have the potential to reshape the way people access health information,\" the lead study author said.

Google Cloud, Google’s cloud services and products division, is collaborating with Highmark Health, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit healthcare company, on generative AI tools designed to personalize the patient intake experience. Amazon’s AWS division says it’s working with unnamed customers on a way to use generative AI to analyze medical databases for “social determinants of health.” And Microsoft Azure is helping to build a generative AI system for Providence, the not-for-profit healthcare network, to automatically triage messages to care providers sent from patients.   Prominent generative AI startups in healthcare include Ambience Healthcare, which is developing a generative AI app for clinicians; Nabla, an ambient AI assistant for practitioners; and Abridge, which creates analytics tools for medical documentation. The broad enthusiasm for generative AI is reflected in the investments in generative AI efforts targeting healthcare. Collectively, generative AI in healthcare startups have raised tens of millions of dollars in venture capital to date, and the vast majority of health investors say that generative AI has significantly influenced their investment strategies. But both professionals and patients are mixed as to whether healthcare-focused generative AI is ready for prime time. In a recent Deloitte survey, only about half (53%) of U.S. consumers said that they thought generative AI could improve healthcare — for example, by making it more accessible or shortening appointment wait times. Fewer than half said they expected generative AI to make medical care more affordable. Andrew Borkowski, chief AI officer at the VA Sunshine Healthcare Network, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ largest health system, doesn’t think that the cynicism is unwarranted. Borkowski warned that generative AI’s deployment could be premature due to its “significant” limitations — and the concerns around its efficacy. “One of the key issues with generative AI is its inability to handle complex medical queries or emergencies,” he told TechCrunch. “Its finite knowledge base — that is, the absence of up-to-date clinical information — and lack of human expertise make it unsuitable for providing comprehensive medical advice or treatment recommendations.” Several studies suggest there’s credence to those points. In a paper in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, OpenAI’s generative AI chatbot, ChatGPT, which some healthcare organizations have piloted for limited use cases, was found to make errors diagnosing pediatric diseases 83% of the time. And in testing OpenAI’s GPT-4 as a diagnostic assistant, physicians at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston observed that the model ranked the wrong diagnosis as its top answer nearly two times out of three. Today’s generative AI also struggles with medical administrative tasks that are part and parcel of clinicians’ daily workflows. On the MedAlign benchmark to evaluate how well generative AI can perform things like summarizing patient health records and searching across notes, GPT-4 failed in 35% of cases. OpenAI and many other generative AI vendors warn against relying on their models for medical advice. But Borkowski and others say they could do more. “Relying solely on generative AI for healthcare could lead to misdiagnoses, inappropriate treatments or even life-threatening situations,” Borkowski said. Jan Egger, who leads AI-guided therapies at the University of Duisburg-Essen’s Institute for AI in Medicine, which studies the applications of emerging technology for patient care, shares Borkowski’s concerns. He believes that the only safe way to use generative AI in healthcare currently is under the close, watchful eye of a physician. “The results can be completely wrong, and it’s getting harder and harder to maintain awareness of this,” Egger said. “Sure, generative AI can be used, for example, for pre-writing discharge letters. But physicians have a responsibility to check it and make the final call.” One particularly harmful way generative AI in healthcare can get things wrong is by perpetuating stereotypes. In a 2023 study out of Stanford Medicine, a team of researchers tested ChatGPT and other generative AI–powered chatbots on questions about kidney function, lung capacity and skin thickness. Not only were ChatGPT’s answers frequently wrong, the co-authors found, but also answers included several reinforced long-held untrue beliefs that there are biological differences between Black and white people — untruths that are known to have led medical providers to misdiagnose health problems. The irony is, the patients most likely to be discriminated against by generative AI for healthcare are also those most likely to use it. People who lack healthcare coverage — people of color, by and large, according to a KFF study — are more willing to try generative AI for things like finding a doctor or mental health support, the Deloitte survey showed. If the AI’s recommendations are marred by bias, it could exacerbate inequalities in treatment. However, some experts argue that generative AI is improving in this regard. In a Microsoft study published in late 2023, researchers said they achieved 90.2% accuracy on four challenging medical benchmarks using GPT-4. Vanilla GPT-4 couldn’t reach this score. But, the researchers say, through prompt engineering — designing prompts for GPT-4 to produce certain outputs — they were able to boost the model’s score by up to 16.2 percentage points. (Microsoft, it’s worth noting, is a major investor in OpenAI.) But asking a chatbot a question isn’t the only thing generative AI is good for. Some researchers say that medical imaging could benefit greatly from the power of generative AI. In July, a group of scientists unveiled a system called complementarity-driven deferral to clinical workflow (CoDoC), in a study published in Nature. The system is designed to figure out when medical imaging specialists should rely on AI for diagnoses versus traditional techniques. CoDoC did better than specialists while reducing clinical workflows by 66%, according to the co-authors.  In November, a Chinese research team demoed Panda, an AI model used to detect potential pancreatic lesions in X-rays. A study showed Panda to be highly accurate in classifying these lesions, which are often detected too late for surgical intervention.  Indeed, Arun Thirunavukarasu, a clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford, said there’s “nothing unique” about generative AI precluding its deployment in healthcare settings. “More mundane applications of generative AI technology are feasible in the short- and mid-term, and include text correction, automatic documentation of notes and letters and improved search features to optimize electronic patient records,” he said. “There’s no reason why generative AI technology — if effective — couldn’t be deployed in these sorts of roles immediately.” But while generative AI shows promise in specific, narrow areas of medicine, experts like Borkowski point to the technical and compliance roadblocks that must be overcome before generative AI can be useful — and trusted — as an all-around assistive healthcare tool. “Significant privacy and security concerns surround using generative AI in healthcare,” Borkowski said. “The sensitive nature of medical data and the potential for misuse or unauthorized access pose severe risks to patient confidentiality and trust in the healthcare system. Furthermore, the regulatory and legal landscape surrounding the use of generative AI in healthcare is still evolving, with questions regarding liability, data protection and the practice of medicine by non-human entities still needing to be solved.” Even Thirunavukarasu, bullish as he is about generative AI in healthcare, says that there needs to be “rigorous science” behind tools that are patient-facing. “Particularly without direct clinician oversight, there should be pragmatic randomized control trials demonstrating clinical benefit to justify deployment of patient-facing generative AI,” he said. “Proper governance going forward is essential to capture any unanticipated harms following deployment at scale.” Recently, the World Health Organization released guidelines that advocate for this type of science and human oversight of generative AI in healthcare as well as the introduction of auditing, transparency and impact assessments on this AI by independent third parties. The goal, the WHO spells out in its guidelines, would be to encourage participation from a diverse cohort of people in the development of generative AI for healthcare and an opportunity to voice concerns and provide input throughout the process. “Until the concerns are adequately addressed and appropriate safeguards are put in place,” Borkowski said, “the widespread implementation of medical generative AI may be … potentially harmful to patients and the healthcare industry as a whole.” Topics \nSenior Reporter, Enterprise\n © 2024 Yahoo.",

The study — released last Tuesday by researchers at MIT, Stanford, and the Rajpurkar Lab of Harvard Medical School — was a re-analysis of a previous study by the same researchers. Published in Nature, it centered on a high-performing AI model and studied its effectiveness in diagnosing patients based on chest X-rays. Pranav Rajpurkar, a Harvard Medical School professor who co-authored the study, emphasized the need for a more detailed understanding of AI in medicine. “While previous studies have shown the potential for AI to improve overall diagnostic accuracy, there was limited understanding of the individual-level impact on clinicians and what factors influence the effectiveness of AI assistance for each radiologist,” he wrote in an emailed statement. The study found that AI use in radiology “did not uniformly improve diagnostic accuracy, and could even hurt performance for some cases,” according to Kathy Yu, a researcher who was a member of the Rajpurkar Lab when the study was conducted. Currently, AI is used by radiologists in image processing, but it has never been employed systemwide for diagnostic purposes. Computer assisted diagnosis dates back to the 1970s and has been leveraged to reinforce a radiologist’s diagnosis, but it is not designed to replace the role of a clinician. Previous studies about the use of AI in medical procedures have highlighted the positive impact it could have on the clinical industry at large. However, the findings of the recent HMS study “challenge several common assumptions about the impact of AI assistance in radiology,” Yu wrote. “Our results show the real-world impact of AI assistance is more complex and conditional than previously thought”, she added. The study refuted many assumptions around AI assistance, namely that prior training or exposure to AI would result in greater accuracy when clinicians used such tools. The idea that AI assistance can “narrow gaps between radiologists” was also refuted, with Yu writing that “lower-performing radiologists did not consistently benefit more from AI assistance.” Susie Y. Huang ’02, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the study demonstrated the continued importance of radiologists, claiming that the replacement of jobs by AI is “actually quite far away.” Huang noted that current modes of AI, while useful in completing simple tasks, have not reached human ability in interpreting images across radiology. “What it’s showing is that a radiologist’s job may be more complex than what one might think,” Huang added. Rajpurkar sees the study as “a call to action” for further research on AI use in radiology. He wrote that “we need to move beyond the hype and fear surrounding AI,” and instead, look towards “an evidence-based understanding” of AI assistance. Rajpurkar also acknowledged the steps AI could take in the future to become more effective in radiology, highlighting the input of practicing radiologists. “Just as we wouldn’t expect every radiologist to instantly master a new imaging technique, we can’t assume every radiologist will seamlessly integrate AI into their decision-making,” he wrote. “The future of AI in radiology is not one-size-fits-all, but rather, tailored integration plans that consider each radiologist’s unique strengths, weaknesses, and cognitive style in interacting with AI,” he wrote.

        "text": "Scientists are already working on using AI to improve the diagnosis of diseases, find better ways to treat patients and extend care to more people. Here are three scenarios for how it might help us live longer, healthier lives. Advancing research and discovery Research suggests that out of 10 drugs in development, nine will typically fail. The use of AI technologies is set to improve success rates and accelerate drug discoveries. “AI offers the opportunity to massively accelerate drug discovery and development and even simulate how the body might respond to certain drugs,” Alex Jenkins, director of Curtin University’s WA Data Science Innovation Hub, told The West Australian. He noted AlphaFold had been a particularly significant achievement in the field of AI. It performs predictions of protein structures with near experimental accuracy. “What used to take a PHD student three years to do can now be done in seconds using this AI,” Mr Jenkins explained. Katie Hampson Katie Hampson “It is massively beneficial for drug discovery and finding potential drugs that can be used to target diseases and disorders from cancer to HIV and any kind of ailment that impacts humans. “I would say of any field, this is the area where AI has made the most tangible difference and it really is feasible that the developers of AlphaFold will win a Nobel Prize for their contributions to science.” He said scientists are also using AI to model the immune system. The benefit of understanding how the immune system works will be more precise, tailored treatments for patients in the future, added Mr Jenkins. Better and faster diagnoses Research shows that every year in Australia there are an estimated 140,000 cases of misdiagnosis. When that figure is broken down, data reveals 21,000 of those people are being seriously harmed and up to 4000 people die. However, integrating AI into healthcare is set to improve disease diagnosis, treatment selection and clinical laboratory testing. “AI will definitely help clinicians with diagnosis,” said Mr Jenkins. “Already the technology is at a point where it is comparable to a human doctor in many cases. “There are still some reliability issues but what we are ready for now is a way to test these AIs in a safe way alongside human doctors.” He said to expect the kind of scenario where you visit your GP but first have a five-minute consultation with an AI before seeing the human doctor. “We would need the research to confirm that the AI is actually fishing out the important things from the consultation and there are also going to be non-verbal things the AI is not going to pick up,” noted Mr Jenkins. “There is no doubt a large part of a GP’s job is identifying the issues that a person isn’t talking about and asking difficult questions so AI is not going to replace human clinicians but we are at a point where I think AI can accelerate and increase the productivity of clinicians and I think the technology is ready to go.” He said ideally trials would begin within 12 months in Australia, involving AI diagnostics and software working alongside human clinicians. Improving the lives of people with disability One in six Australians lives with a disability and, according to Dr Stephanie Stoll, an expert in AI-powered sign language translation, generative AI is driving inclusivity and accessibility. She said it has the potential to bridge communication barriers for the deaf community. Already, some of Britain’s busiest train stations are trialling technology developed in Germany which provides live journey information translated into sign language on digital screens. Dr Stoll said hard of hearing people who often struggle to hear station announcements are benefitting from this kind of AI. Meanwhile, scientists at Curtin University are looking at how AI chatbots can help people with autism overcome difficulties with social communication and social interaction. The company behind ChatGPT is also investigating how to use AI to assist the estimated 250 million people globally with vision impairment. For example, a visual assistance tool dubbed Be My Eyes is using ChatGPT’s ability to describe visuals to help people who are blind or with low vision with hundreds of daily tasks. “Advancements in AI have changed what is possible in this space, be it translating spoken words to sign language for people with deafness, using AI models to describe the world for the vision impaired, or using large language models and chatbots to support adolescents with autism to build social skills,” Mr Jenkins added.

        "text": "Over the last few decades, traditional artificial intelligence has largely been in service of making healthcare safer and better (the Institute of Medicine's 2000 report \"To Err Is Human\" described that nearly 100,000 people died annually of medical errors in hospitals). However, it's only its successor — generative AI — that has made efficiency a priority. Philadelphia news 24/7: Watch NBC10 free wherever you are Nvidia, known primarily as a hardware and chip company, has been working to optimize the health care space for 15 years. Kimberly Powell, Nvidia's vice president of health care, and her team build domain-specific applications for health care, including in the realm of imaging, computing, genomics and drug discovery, under the umbrella of the \"Clara\" suite. \"It's really just taking these mini applications, wiring them up so that they can perform and deliver a valuable service to an end market,\" said Powell. Health care is one of the largest data industries, Powell says. Naturally, it's also a massively regulated industry and must be brought to market with care. \"Some come at it from the idea that we're late to the game. I'm not sure that's true,\" said Dr. Josh Fessel, director of the office of translational medicine at the National Institutes of Health. \"You're dealing with human beings and you have to be incredibly careful with issues of privacy, security, transparency.\" Translational medicine, Fessel's bread and butter, is how you get from a good idea to a thing that is actually poised to help people. In that, AI is the quest of the moment.  AI is already being deployed to streamline contact centers, modernize code to make institutions cloud native and create documents to help reduce medical burnout (Adam Kay's memoir \"This Is Going To Hurt,\" in which he describes what led up to his own career-ending burnout, is not an anomaly). However, the thing about document creation, says Dr. Kaveh Safavi, senior managing director for Accenture's global health care business, is that medical professionals must learn to verbalize their findings in the exam room. \"That's all part of the reality,\" he said. \"The technology requires the human to change in order to gain the benefit.\" A March study found that using AI to generate draft replies to patient inbox messages reduced burden and burnout scores in medical professionals, but didn't reduce the amount of time they spent on this task. But time is not the only factor that's important, Fessel says. Meanwhile, AI-enabled solutions are on the horizon for efficiently matching potential participants to clinical trials, expediting drug development, and completing the time-consuming aspects of translating documents for non-English speaking patients and trial participants. Safavi says that globally, the nursing shortage is the biggest problem in health care (an Accenture report calls it a \"global health emergency\"), and he anticipates new technologies will begin to deploy within the next year to address this pressing concern. Amidst all this, there are still kinks to work out. For example, the Clinical & Translational Science Award (CTSA) Program for the Mount Sinai Health System found in October that predictive models that use health record data to determine patient outlooks end up influencing the real-world treatments that providers give those patients, ultimately reducing the accuracy of the technology's own predictions. In other words, if the algorithm does what it's supposed to do, it will change the data — but then it operates on data that's different from what it learned, ultimately reducing its performance. \"It changes its own world, basically,\" said Fessel. \"It raises the question: What does continuing medical education for an algorithm look like? We don't know yet.\" To combat knowledge gaps like this, Fessel argues for a team approach across institutions. \"Sharing what we're learning is absolutely vital,\" he said. Having a chief AI officer in place at a health institution can be helpful as long as they are empowered to bring in other brains and resources, he says. Nvidia practices this by partnering with a range of organizations to deploy \"microservices,\" or software that integrates into an institution's existing applications. In addition to helping navigate evolving regulatory terrain (like looming requirements for software as a medical device, or SaMD, per the U.S. Food & Drug Administration), it makes transformation more within reach. For example, Nvidia partnered with a company called Abridge on one of its first applications, which integrates into the electronic health record system Epic to streamline medical summaries. Meanwhile, Nvidia is collaborating with Medtronic, which uses computer vision to identify 50% more potentially cancer-causing polyps in colonoscopies. And in tandem with the Novo Nordisk foundation, they're developing a national center for AI innovation in Denmark that will house one of the most powerful AI supercomputers in the world. Right now, what provider organizations are largely prioritizing is getting ready for generative AI, says Safavi. This includes getting their technology house in order to prepare for cloud-native tools that need to be able to access the data. This also involves developing a responsible AI posture that protects privacy and intellectual property but dissuades the use of technology for diagnosis, Safavi said. \"We want the human to be the last mile of the judgment,\" he said. Safavi said his biggest fear of AI in the health care space is that organizations won't employ policies against technological diagnosis, and something bad will happen as a result. \"There's a reason to be proactive around putting boundaries,\" he said. \"In the absence of that, a bad outcome is likely to result in an overly generalized regulatory schema, which none of us benefits from.\" In March, the European Union adopted the Artificial Intelligence Act, which addresses AI safeguards, biometric identification systems, social scoring and rights to complaint and transparency. Safavi has worked in about 25 countries over the last 15 years and says any regulatory system the U.S. adopts will likely reflect that of the E.U., but we're not there yet. Even with all these evolutions, there is still so much unknown about how various health conditions develop and the role the environment plays. \"To pretend that there are no black boxes in medicine is not true,\" said Fessel. Redefining how health care operates gives the field an opportunity to re-examine many fundamental ideas about how we deliver care and learn new things, he adds. \"That, to me, is one of the things that makes it so potentially transformative.\"",
        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nTraditional artificial intelligence has focused on making healthcare safer and better, but its successor, generative AI, is prioritizing efficiency. Nvidia has been working to optimize the healthcare space for 15 years, building domain-specific applications for healthcare. Healthcare is a large and regulated industry, requiring careful consideration of privacy, security, and transparency. AI is being used to streamline contact centers, modernize code, and create documents to reduce medical burnout. However, medical professionals must learn to adapt to using AI-generated documents. AI-enabled solutions are being developed to match patients to clinical trials, expedite drug development, and translate documents for non-English speakers. The global nursing shortage is a major problem, and new technologies are expected to deploy within the next year to address it. Despite progress, there are still kinks to work out, such as predictive models influencing real-world treatments and reducing their own accuracy. A team approach across institutions is necessary to combat knowledge gaps and ensure responsible AI deployment.

Imagine a chatbot that lacks the capacity to feel emotions, asking its human patient, \"How do you feel about that?\" It could soon be a reality for patients seeking mental health care, depending on the path they choose. For some, perhaps, it already is.  The rise of A.I. in recent years has forever transformed the human experience – infiltrating the workforce, helping design new products and even aiding physicians by recognizing certain ailments before humans might notice them on their own.  Now some A.I. platforms are promoting software that claims to be your pocket therapist, but it invites questions – does the technology have the capacity to connect with humans as other humans might? Can support be tailored to each individual? Can it tackle more complex or even life-threatening emotional needs? Or could people misuse such technology to self-diagnose or avoid professional care in the long run? TACO BELL, PIZZA HUT GOING ‘AI-FIRST’ WITH FAST-FOOD INNOVATIONS Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health issues people face, and the problem is on the rise. (iStock / iStock) \"While A.I. has made significant strides in understanding and processing human emotions, replicating the genuine human touch, empathy, and emotional connection of a counselor is a profound challenge. The subtleties of human communication and empathy are difficult to encode into algorithms,\" Sergio Muriel, a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and Certified Addiction Professional and COO of Diamond Recovery Group in Florida, told Fox News Digital. People suffering from conditions like depression or anxiety might turn to technology for fear of judgment, thinking they can avoid the stigma society commonly attaches to mental health. All it takes is a simple Google search for a \"chatbot therapist\" or an \"A.I. therapist\" and the results populate with apps like Wysa – the anxiety, therapy chatbot – or Elomia Health's mental health chatbot. NETFLIX'S TED SARANDOS TELLS ROB LOWE AI ‘IS NO SHORTCUT FOR THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE’ Artificial intelligence has transformed the way humans think about technology and go about their lives, ranging from school and work to the products they consume. (iStock / iStock) Muriel thinks the rise of A.I. in mental health care can yield several benefits, both for those seeking care and for those providing it, but it should still be used with caution and as a complement for professional care with an experienced human. \"It's an exciting evolution, offering new pathways for support and intervention,\" he said. \"The integration of A.I. into mental health care has potential benefits but also requires caution. A.I. can offer immediate, anonymous support, making it a valuable tool for those hesitant to seek traditional therapy. However, it's essential to ensure these technologies are used responsibly and complement, rather than replace, human care.\" As he mentioned, A.I. technology boasts its ability to be available at your fingertips 24/7, a feat it emphasizes on its own. \"No appointments or waiting rooms. Instant replies even on weekends and at 4 A.M.,\" Elomia Health's website reads, additionally noting that 21% of users said they would not have spoken to anyone outside A.I. out of fear of being judged. HEALTH EXPERTS RAISE CONCERNS OVER AI APPS CLAIMING TO BE POCKET NUTRITION ASSISTANTS CFRA Research equity analyst Angelo Zino joined 'Varney & Co.' to discuss which A.I. stocks he'd give a \"buy\" rating. Additional safeguards are built into the platform as well, including redirection to therapists or Hotlines if someone potentially needs additional help. Muriel said such A.I.-based approaches are beneficial for triaging \"low-risk\" clients and thereby helping professionals manage caseloads. \"[It can] offer new insights into mental health through data analysis. It can extend the reach of mental health services to underserved areas,\" he elaborated. \"[But] there's a risk of over-reliance on AI, potential privacy concerns, and the loss of the nuanced understanding that comes from human interaction. A.I. cannot yet fully replicate the empathy and depth of a human therapist.\" CLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS  Dr. Marc Siegel discusses the potential of A.I. threatening the role of medical professionals. Using such software can also lead to misdiagnosis, and sole reliance on A.I.-powered mental health tools for those with a history of self-harm or suicidal ideation is especially \"dangerous,\" he continued. Though it's a promising development and speculated by some to be the future of mental health in medicine, the message he wants everyone to take home is that – rather than viewing technology as a potential human replacement – perhaps it should be viewed as just another tool to help make life easier. \"A.I. should at most be a supplementary tool, not a replacement for human care,\" he said.

        "text": "News Article Author(s): Explainability, consent, and responsibility are noted as challenges that may hinder implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) in cancer care, according to a new study. \n In a recent survey of more than 200 US oncologists, most indicated that oncologists should be able to explain how artificial intelligence (AI) works to use these decision-making models in clinics.  As AI becomes more common across cancer care settings, oncologists are struggling with the ethics of its use in medical decision making. In this study, the researchers aimed to gain an understanding on oncologists’ views around the ethics of AI in a clinical setting. Physician holds hand of patient | C Davids/peopleimages.com - stock.adobe.com The descriptive, cross-sectional survey is published in JAMA Network Open.1  \"The findings provide a first look at where oncologists are in thinking about the ethical implications of AI in cancer care,\" Andrew Hantel, MD, a faculty member in the Divisions of Leukemia and Population Sciences at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead researcher of the study, said in a statement.2 \"AI has the potential to produce major advances in cancer research and treatment, but there hasn't been a lot of education for stakeholders—the physicians and others who will use this technology—about what its adoption will mean for their practice.”  The population-based survey was conducted from January to July 2023, using data from the National Plan & Provider Enumeration System. A draft instrument was conducted based on 24 questions pertaining to demographics and the following domains: AI familiarity, predictions, explainability, bias, deference, and responsibilities.  The main outcome of the study was oncologists’ responses to the question asking if patients need to provide informed consent for AI model use during cancer treatment decisions.  Of the 387 surveys conducted, 204 were completed. Participants included in the study represented 37 states, 63.7% identified as male, 62.7% as non-Hispanic White, and 29.5% were from academic practices. Additionally, 46.6% had some previous education of health care and AI and 45.3% reported experience with clinical decision models.  Furthermore, 84.8% of participants believed that AI-based clinical decision models should be explainable by oncologists to be used in a clinical setting, and 23% said these models should also be explainable to their patients.  Most (81.4%) participants supported the use of AI models during treatment decisions. When presented with a scenario in which an AI model selects a different treatment regimen than the oncologist planned, 36.8% of participants said they would present both options and let their patient decide. Additionally, oncologists from academic settings were more likely to let their patient decide which treatment option they wanted (OR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.19-5.51).  Additionally, most (90.7%) participants believed AI developers were responsible for micro-legal problems caused by AI use, although some oncologists believed this responsibility should be shared by physicians (47.1%) or hospitals (43.1%). Furthermore, 76.5% of participants agreed that it was the oncologists’ responsibility to protect patients from biased AI tools, but only 27.9% were confident in their ability to identify poorly representative AI models.  These findings suggest that most oncologists believe patients don’t need to understand the methodology behind AI decision models, even though most agreed that patients should consent to its use and many tasked patients with choosing between physician- vs AI-recommended treatment regimens.  Therefore, the researchers of this study believe that AI implementation into oncology care needs to include assessments of its impact on care decisions as well as considerations pertaining to treatment decision responsibility.  \"It's critical that we assess now, in the early stages of AI's application to clinical care, how it will impact that care and what we need to do to make sure it's deployed responsibly. Oncologists need to be part of that conversation,\" Hantel said in a following statement.2 “This study seeks to begin building a bridge between the development of AI and the expectations and ethical obligations of its end-users.”   References 1.

The research aims to help a healthcare industry still reeling from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (which, coincidentally, interrupted this study) and looking for better methods of tracking outbreaks before they cripple hospitals and harm more people. Researchers are turning to AI tools to sort through data and more quickly and accurately identify trends. “Despite significant progress in reducing healthcare-associated infection outbreaks, including of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, they remain an industry challenge and can present as clusters that signal potential for transmission to patients,” Joseph Perz, DrPH, MA, senior advisor for public health programs in the CDC’s Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion and a committee member for the CDC’s Council for Outbreak Response: Healthcare-Associated Infections, said in the release. “The CLUSTER trial provides evidence that early detection powered by automation tools and quick action can prevent outbreaks from growing.” In this trial, researchers created an “algorithm-driven statistical detection tool” that combed through laboratory data for signs of more than 100 bacterial and fungal infections, then posted real-time alerts to infection control programs. The process included both an automated review of patients’ clinical cultures and a statistical assessment of whether patients with these specific infections were increasing in number. The results of the study were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to researchers, automated alerts weren’t as effective during the pandemic because hospital staff were so busy that they weren’t able to respond to the alerts in time.

Upon a closer look, she saw that models often worked differently — specifically worse — for populations including Black women, a revelation that took her by surprise. “I hadn’t made the connection beforehand that health disparities would translate directly to model disparities,” she says. “And given that I am a visible minority woman-identifying computer scientist at MIT, I am reasonably certain that many others weren’t aware of this either.” In a paper published Jan. 14 in the journal Patterns, Ghassemi — who earned her doctorate in 2017 and is now an assistant professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and the MIT Institute for Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) — and her coauthor, Elaine Okanyene Nsoesie of Boston University, offer a cautionary note about the prospects for AI in medicine. “If used carefully, this technology could improve performance in health care and potentially reduce inequities,” Ghassemi says. “But if we’re not actually careful, technology could worsen care.” It all comes down to data, given that the AI tools in question train themselves by processing and analyzing vast quantities of data. But the data they are given are produced by humans, who are fallible and whose judgments may be clouded by the fact that they interact differently with patients depending on their age, gender, and race, without even knowing it. Furthermore, there is still great uncertainty about medical conditions themselves. “Doctors trained at the same medical school for 10 years can, and often do, disagree about a patient’s diagnosis,” Ghassemi says. That’s different from the applications where existing machine-learning algorithms excel — like object-recognition tasks — because practically everyone in the world will agree that a dog is, in fact, a dog. Machine-learning algorithms have also fared well in mastering games like chess and Go, where both the rules and the “win conditions” are clearly defined. Physicians, however, don’t always concur on the rules for treating patients, and even the win condition of being “healthy” is not widely agreed upon. “Doctors know what it means to be sick,” Ghassemi explains, “and we have the most data for people when they are sickest. But we don’t get much data from people when they are healthy because they’re less likely to see doctors then.” Even mechanical devices can contribute to flawed data and disparities in treatment. Pulse oximeters, for example, which have been calibrated predominately on light-skinned individuals, do not accurately measure blood oxygen levels for people with darker skin. And these deficiencies are most acute when oxygen levels are low — precisely when accurate readings are most urgent. Similarly, women face increased risks during “metal-on-metal” hip replacements, Ghassemi and Nsoesie write, “due in part to anatomic differences that aren’t taken into account in implant design.” Facts like these could be buried within the data fed to computer models whose output will be undermined as a result. Coming from computers, the product of machine-learning algorithms offers “the sheen of objectivity,” according to Ghassemi. But that can be deceptive and dangerous, because it’s harder to ferret out the faulty data supplied en masse to a computer than it is to discount the recommendations of a single possibly inept (and maybe even racist) doctor. “The problem is not machine learning itself,” she insists. “It’s people. Human caregivers generate bad data sometimes because they are not perfect.” Nevertheless, she still believes that machine learning can offer benefits in health care in terms of more efficient and fairer recommendations and practices. One key to realizing the promise of machine learning in health care is to improve the quality of data, which is no easy task. “Imagine if we could take data from doctors that have the best performance and share that with other doctors that have less training and experience,” Ghassemi says. “We really need to collect this data and audit it.” The challenge here is that the collection of data is not incentivized or rewarded, she notes. “It’s not easy to get a grant for that, or ask students to spend time on it. And data providers might say, ‘Why should I give my data out for free when I can sell it to a company for millions?’ But researchers should be able to access data without having to deal with questions like: ‘What paper will I get my name on in exchange for giving you access to data that sits at my institution?’ “The only way to get better health care is to get better data,” Ghassemi says, “and the only way to get better data is to incentivize its release.” It’s not only a question of collecting data. There’s also the matter of who will collect it and vet it. Ghassemi recommends assembling diverse groups of researchers — clinicians, statisticians, medical ethicists, and computer scientists — to first gather diverse patient data and then “focus on developing fair and equitable improvements in health care that can be deployed in not just one advanced medical setting, but in a wide range of medical settings.” The objective of the Patterns paper is not to discourage technologists from bringing their expertise in machine learning to the medical world, she says. “They just need to be cognizant of the gaps that appear in treatment and other complexities that ought to be considered before giving their stamp of approval to a particular computer model.” Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi speaks with NPR host Kate Wells about a decision by the National Eating Disorders Associations to replace their helpline with a chatbot. “I think it's very alienating to have an interactive system present you with irrelevant or what can feel like tangential information,” says Ghassemi. Prof. Marzyeh Ghassemi speaks with WBUR reporter Geoff Brumfiel about her research studying the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. “When you take state-of-the-art machine learning methods and systems and then evaluate them on different patient groups, they do not perform equally,” says Ghassemi.

        "text": "A lawyer friend once told me, “90% of non-criminal law is arguing over who gets stuck with the tab.” More and more people are asking this precise question with respect to who should be held liable when physicians utilize medical artificial intelligence and the AI makes a mistake that harms the patient. Normally, if a patient suffers harm due to the negligence or wrongdoing of a physician, this is covered by medical malpractice law. For example, if a physician fails to recognize an obvious heart attack and dismisses the patient’s chest pain as mere heartburn, that would constitute malpractice. (Of course, some cases of early heart attack are subtle and might be reasonably misdiagnosed by the majority of competent physicians. Such errors do not necessarily constitute malpractice, and lawyers can spend a lot of time arguing whether or not a particular diagnosis was reasonable at the time of the patient encounter, even if it turns out to have been mistaken in retrospect.) Can you sue the medical AI if it makes a mistake? Conversely, if a patient suffers harm due to a flawed medical device, this would be typically be covered by product liability law. In the 1980s, flawed software in the Therac-25 radiation therapy machine resulted in several patients receiving 100 times the prescribed dose. Unfortunately, these patients died or suffered serious radiation injuries. The manufacturer ended up settling the subsequent lawsuits for a figure estimated to be over $150 million. However, if a physician utilizes artificial intelligence software to help with patient care and the AI makes a mistake, this doesn’t quite fall neatly into either of these two categories. This is especially relevant with many current “black box” AI systems, where not even the system designers know how the AI arrived at its conclusion. The questions over who pays are not just theoretical. According to Dr. Jesse Ehrenfeld, president of the American Medical Association, “We’re seeing lawsuits already.“ Naturally, physicians would like to shift any liability for faulty AI performance to the AI companies as much as possible. On the other hand, technology companies like to point out that medical treatment decisions are ultimately made by physicians, who must sign off on the final treatment plan. So they contend any errors made by AI assistants are ultimately the physician’s legal responsibility. Another complicating factor is the evolving standard of care for physicians using AI. Right now, AI systems are still optional for physicians. But as medical AI systems improve in quality and thus become more commonplace, physicians who deliberately choose not to use AI for fear of computer errors can leave themselves open to charges of practicing below the standard of care. For example, suppose a future radiology AI system improved to the point that it could reliably detect 99% of breast cancers on a mammogram, whereas a skilled human only detected 90%. Radiologists who failed to use AI could arguably be accused of delivering substandard care. Thus, we may see conflicting legal incentives for physicians both to use and to not use AI. Dr. Jonathan Mezrich notes that one possible solution would be a “no fault” indemnity system for AI-related medical injuries, much like the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. The NVICP covers certain vaccine-caused harms to patients, paid for by a tax on vaccines. In theory, this protects vaccine manufacturers from certain high-risk financial penalties, while also allowing qualified plaintiffs the ability to receive monetary compensation more quickly with fewer bureaucratic and legal hurdles. A similar system could be used to protect medical AI. (Note: The American Association For Justice, an association of trial lawyers, opposes legislation that limits legal accountability for medical AI misdiagnosis.) Another novel approach would be to declare the AI a legal “person” for the purpose of liability. As explained by Sullivan and Schweikart in the AMA Journal Of Ethics, the AI would be required to be insured “similar to how physicians possess medical malpractice insurance” and would “then be sued directly for any negligence claims.” At present, these legal issues are unsettled. I am thus encouraged that the US Congress is considering how best to clarify such liability issues for both physicians and technology companies. I am still very optimistic about the benefits of medical AI for patient care. Not a week goes by that I don’t read news stories such as how AI can predict breast cancer risk up to 5 years in the future, detect early diabetic retinopathy (diabetes-induced vision damage), or detect early spread of lung cancer. Thus, I hope policymakers and legislators find a way to encourage continued innovation and progress, while providing appropriate legal recourse for those wrongly harmed by flawed medical AI.",
        "summary": "Here is a summary of the article in 10 sentences:\n\nA lawyer once said that 90% of non-criminal law is arguing over who pays the bill, which is relevant to the question of who is liable when medical AI makes a mistake that harms a patient. Normally, medical malpractice law covers physician negligence, but product liability law covers flawed medical devices. However, AI mistakes don't fit neatly into either category, especially with \"black box\" systems where the designers don't know how the AI arrived at its conclusion. Physicians want to shift liability to AI companies, while tech companies argue that physicians are ultimately responsible for treatment decisions. The standard of care for physicians using AI is evolving, and those who choose not to use AI may be seen as practicing below the standard of care. This could lead to conflicting legal incentives for physicians to use or not use AI. One possible solution is a \"no fault\" indemnity system for AI-related injuries, similar to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Another approach is to declare the AI a legal \"person\" for the purpose of liability, requiring it to be insured like physicians. The legal issues surrounding AI liability are currently unsettled, but the US Congress is considering how to clarify them. The author is optimistic about the benefits of medical AI and hopes policymakers will find a way to encourage innovation while providing legal recourse for those harmed by flawed AI."
