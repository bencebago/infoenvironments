We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Yet another downside to fossil fuel dependence. It\u2019s a mundane day for errands: you run out to the store to pick up some groceries, some drugstore supplies, and fill up the gas tank. Afterward, you cook up some lunch on the gas stove. For all this, you\u2019d be spending roughly 8.5 percent more than you were a year ago, based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 July report on prices for consumer goods and services \u2014 over the course of the month, that translates into roughly $500 more for most households than last year. Economists have pointed to energy prices as the main reason for high inflation. Americans have had to spend more on gasoline, on natural gas for stoves, water heaters, and furnaces, and on any electricity derived from oil and gas. But the impact from fossil fuels is bigger than that \u2014 energy prices indirectly affect virtually every part of the economy. The impact of higher energy prices is especially evident in food prices, because most of the cost of food is based on how expensive it is to get from the farm to the shelf. But it\u2019s also affecting other consumer goods. For example, Amazon recently hiked its Amazon Prime rates in European countries, citing rising costs for fuel and transportation. Mark Zandi, Moody\u2019s chief economist, said fossil fuels were a major cause of every period of inflation since World War II. \u201cInvariably, it\u2019s the high cost of oil and fossil fuels in general that drive big fluctuations and overall inflation,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cEvery recession since World War II has been preceded by a jump in oil prices.\u201d Higher oil and gas prices are responsible for about 40 percent of the price increases across the economy (or 3.8 percentage points of the 8.5 percent inflation from July, according to calculations from Moody\u2019s). One big reason that inflation cooled down this month could be that energy prices are falling; natural gas and gasoline are cheaper than they were earlier in the year. But even though prices have decreased, they are still higher than a year ago. In general, the consumer can still expect to be paying a lot more for goods and services in the near future. The interplay between the price of fuel and the price of everything else over the last year shows what a tight hold fossil fuels have on the economy. The US is trapped in a cycle where oil and gas prices go up, and political leaders try to do everything they can to bring them down again to lessen the burden on inflation. It pits renewable energy sources against the economy. Breaking free of this means shifting to more electricity that\u2019s powered by solar and wind to fuel cars, homes, and businesses. Reducing reliance on fossil fuels \u201cwill significantly reduce its grip on inflation in the broader economy,\u201d said Zandi. It\u2019s the reason why economists eventually expect the Inflation Reduction Act to live up to the bill\u2019s name. A complicated set of factors is driving inflation right now \u2014 including but not limited to supply chain problems, insufficient labor, and anticipated gas shortages in Europe \u2014 but dig a bit deeper, and a common element is reliance on fossil fuels. Inflation isn\u2019t just an issue in the US or because of federal spending in the pandemic. It\u2019s doubled in the last year in 37 advanced economies. In some circles, economists have preferred to use \u201cfossilflation\u201d as the more accurate description of current inflation woes. European Central Bank executive board member Isabel Schnabel used the term in a March speech on the new age of inflation. \u201cFossilflation reflects the legacy cost of the dependency on fossil energy sources,\u201d she said. Volatility is always a feature of relying heavily on fuels to drive the economy. These are commodities that have to be stored, refined, and transported; as Gernot Wagner, a climate economist at Columbia Business School, explained, \u201ccommodities always fluctuate.\u201d This was especially true in the 1970s and \u201980s when the economy suffered under even higher inflation. The circumstances driving higher prices today are different, of course. The oil industry has had a tumultuous few years during the pandemic: it is now drilling fewer wells and struggling with limited available refinery capacity that hasn\u2019t matched the sharp rise in demand. And Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting global sanctions have lowered available supplies of oil and gas, and prices are higher accordingly in anticipation of winter shortages in Europe. \u201cA hundred years into the oil age it shouldn\u2019t surprise us anymore that every decade or so something happens somewhere and prices go up,\u201d Wagner said. BLS\u2019s July report actually showed no growth in inflation last month. The reason is the same: fossil fuel prices. Zandi explained that June\u2019s high numbers reflected Europe\u2019s decision to sanction Russian oil and gas. But investors seemed to have overestimated the impact on actual global oil and gas supplies, which is why prices came down a bit in the following weeks. It\u2019s not ideal to be this tethered to oil\u2019s ups and downs. The oil industry is reaping rewards while consumers suffer higher prices. The 50 biggest oil and gas companies raked in $113 billion in profit so far in 2022, because of high prices, according to one calculation. And they\u2019re still getting billions in subsidies, with the entire US oil and gas industry receiving more than $20 billion in tax breaks, according to a 2017 analysis from Oil Change International. The solutions for climate change perform double duty and help consumers break free from this cycle. Green tech isn\u2019t a panacea for the economy; in fact, \u201cgreenflation\u201d is the term coined for higher demand for copper, lithium, and cobalt needed for clean technology. But moving off of fossil fuels does help in one major way. Rather than rely on fuel, a commodity, Wagner argues that the US adopting renewables will mean a switch to technological solutions. \u201cTechnologies, by definition, get better and get cheaper,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way to get off the unfortunate cycle of fossilflation.\u201d What Congress\u2019s investments could do, if they truly help to move the American economy off of its fossil fuel reliance, is to break the economy free from the volatility of oil markets. The Inflation Reduction Act promises to help because it does a few simultaneous things. It invests in solutions that help to reduce consumer demand for fossil fuels, and incentivizes manufacturers and businesses to do the same. It also raises taxes on corporations, another way of curbing inflation, \u201cnot dissimilar to the Fed raising [interest] rates,\u201d said Energy Innovation\u2019s Robbie Orvis, an economic modeler who has studied the impact of the bill. The IRA\u2019s nearly $370 billion in climate measures aren\u2019t going to make a dent in current inflation. But as the decade goes on, economists like Zandi expect that Americans may start to feel some difference. Moody\u2019s estimates that by 2030, the bill could reduce the typical American household\u2019s spending on energy by more than $300 each year, in today\u2019s dollars. It also may help with insurance rates for home and business properties because of its investments slashing emissions (which worsen climate change) and in physical climate adaptation. Another report from Rewiring America finds even greater gains when tallying up the bill\u2019s total tax credits for electric vehicles, rooftop solar, and electric appliances like heat pumps. Rewiring America found a household would save $1,800 annually if it adopted all this clean tech. Of course, doing all this in your household costs a lot of money up front. There are still some policies in the bill that target low-income households specifically, like expanding a low-income home rebate that covers the full cost of heat pump installation, with a cap of $8,000. \u201cThat could go a long way to mitigating the ups and downs in the broader economy and our standard of living,\u201d Zandi said. These policies are too late to help with high prices in the immediate future, but they will stem the impact of the next major crisis.

        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we\u2019re committed to clarity, truth, and depth \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard. That kind of journalism isn\u2019t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Coal, oil, and natural gas producers have found their vision for a low-carbon world. HOUSTON, Texas \u2014 In a video message projected onto massive screens in a packed conference hall, Sultan al-Jaber, the president of the COP28 climate conference held in the United Arab Emirates last year, graciously accepted a leadership award from one of the world\u2019s biggest energy industry conventions.  Al-Jaber, who when not running UN climate summits is also the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, faced criticism from environmental groups for inviting major oil and gas companies to participate in the international climate negotiations. He also faced scrutiny for his comments that it\u2019s not necessary to eliminate fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. But here in Houston, before a much friendlier crowd, he remained defiant.  \u201cIf the world is going to meet its climate goals, every stakeholder has to act,\u201d al-Jaber said, with a model of a wind turbine on his desk. \u201cEveryone had a seat at the table, everyone was invited to contribute, and everyone did contribute.\u201d  CERAWeek by S&P Global \u2014 an annual conference of oil, gas, coal, renewable, and nuclear energy industries \u2014 returned the invitation, putting the once taboo topic of climate change in its headline.  \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that [al-Jaber] helped the global community chart pathways to a sustainable future,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil history The Prize and the founder of CERAWeek. The conference isn\u2019t meant to produce any formal agreements or treaties, but what attendees say on stage and behind closed doors often ripple through the global energy industry.  While only a sliver of the size of the last climate meeting \u2014 more than 8,000 delegates were at CERAWeek compared to more than 80,000 attendees at COP28 \u2014 the conference represents some of the most powerful companies in the world with trillions of dollars at their disposal to shape the future of global energy and the climate. The theme this year was \u201cMultidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, climate, technology and geopolitics.\u201d The unwieldy title is an example of how the convention has grown in scope since it started in 1981 and how the industries it represents have begun to redefine their roles in a world constrained by rising average temperatures, yet still primarily dependent on fossil fuels. What was once a low-key meeting of oil and gas executives and analysts to talk frankly and cut deals has become a slick news-making tech conference where attendees are well fed and, after hours, well lubricated by sponsors. Think of it as Davos for the oil and gas set, hosted in the energy capital of the US. \u201cTwenty years ago you could not have a conversation here about climate change. Full stop,\u201d Mark Brownstein, senior vice president for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who has attended the conference for decades, told Vox.  By now everyone at CERAWeek has gotten the memo on global warming and understood the assignment, at least in rhetoric. The world\u2019s largest energy firms have come to a general consensus that the world is shifting toward clean energy \u2014 but that fossil fuels are still going to be necessary for the foreseeable future. \u201cThese truths are not in conflict,\u201d said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. \u201cThe momentum of the clean energy transition is undeniable, even as we are the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.\u201d  Every talk and panel discussion nodded to the energy transition, toward carbon management, efficiency, and clean tech. When it comes to energy sources \u2014 wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, oil, hydrogen, coal, nuclear, geothermal, and even fusion \u2014 CERAWeek has truly embraced diversity, equity, and inclusion.  But even with greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reaching levels not seen in eons and after the hottest year humans have ever measured, the fossil fuel industry whose products are driving climate change sees a bright future for itself. After all, despite the extraordinary expansion of clean energy generation, fossil fuels have only lost a small share of the global energy mix and are still expecting more growth.  The majors believe that technologies like carbon capture and storage will allow them to continue selling their wares as emissions regulations ratchet down, and that power-devouring technologies like artificial intelligence and growing markets in developing countries will continue to raise demand. By some estimates, data center electricity use is on track to more than double by 2026. Coal, oil, and natural gas consumption are at or near record highs in many parts of the world and their emissions are currently on track to grow through 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. The world is hungry for BTUs and watts, and the energy industry is eager to serve them.  \u201cI\u2019m actually more optimistic today than I\u2019ve ever been in this job,\u201d ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told attendees, noting that COP28 was the first climate conference he has ever attended. But that optimism hasn\u2019t been matched with urgency on climate change, and the industry has a long history of slowing progress. While the language has changed more recently, the oil and gas industry has spent decades thwarting action on climate change, with lobbying, litigation, and misinformation. Exxon\u2019s own scientists produced accurate internal forecasts of rising average temperatures as early as the 1970s while the company published full-page ads in newspapers casting doubt on warming into the late 1990s.  Russia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has also put energy security back on the front burner. For some countries, energy security today matters more than climate change tomorrow, leading them to prioritize secure sources, including fossil fuels in some cases. (Energy security wasn\u2019t the only echo of the war \u2014 CERAWeek also helpfully reminded participants in its registration form not to attend if they are subject to sanctions.)  So while appetites for cleaner energy sources are growing, the stalwarts of the global energy industry have made it clear they aren\u2019t letting go of the fuels that powered their rise. As these companies have grudgingly come to acknowledge climate change, many concerned about global warming have also begun to grapple with the likelihood that fossil fuels aren\u2019t fading away anytime soon. And while most energy companies do envision reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, the current pace is nowhere near fast enough to bend the curve to meet climate goals. The future for the global energy industry is not just brighter, but hotter.  Across the skybridge from the hotel in the neighboring convention center, CERAWeek hosts what it calls Innovation Agora, where tech entrepreneurs and energy startups pitch their solutions to climate change in glass-walled booths under purple lights. It was once the kids\u2019 table of the conference when it launched in 2017 but has since evolved into a parallel production, a clear reflection of clean energy\u2019s massive growth and immense potential.  \u201cGlobally, clean energy investment has overtaken fossil fuel investment every year since 2016, according to the IEA,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cIn the US, clean energy investment has tripled since 2018.\u201d The fossil fuel industry talks less about competition between conventional sources and renewables and more about collaboration between the \u201cmolecule\u201d and the \u201celectron\u201d solution set, as Exxon\u2019s Woods described it. The molecules are the hydrocarbons of coal, oil, and gas and increasingly, hydrogen, while the electrons are those generated by solar panels and wind turbines.  \u201cI\u2019m not suggesting one\u2019s better than the other one,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting is, we need both, and you need companies who have our scale, our capabilities.\u201d  Unsurprisingly, the \u201cmolecule\u201d companies have their eyes set on the technologies that play to their strengths. Hydrogen, a gas most commonly produced by reforming methane, fits well into the fossil fuel industry\u2019s existing refining, pipeline, storage, and retail infrastructure. Geothermal, which harnesses heat from beneath the Earth\u2019s surface, draws on the sector\u2019s expertise in geology and drilling. Carbon capture \u2014 from smokestacks, from the ocean, from the air \u2014 gives fossil fuels a way to zero out their emissions, at least on paper, extending them a lifeline in a world where emissions must ratchet down. In the US, the Biden administration has set a target of cutting national greenhouse gas emissions in half compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  US government incentives are sweetening the deal for cleaner energy technologies. The trio of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have mobilized billions of dollars to research, build, and deploy low-emissions energy systems and the products that enable them. Unlike past legislative attempts to tackle climate change, these laws are almost all incentives, with no restrictions or caps on greenhouse gases baked in.  \u201cI am very supportive of the IRA, because, as legislated, the IRA focuses on carbon intensity and in theory, [is] technology agnostic,\u201d Woods said. As for the villains, the energy industry as well as environmental groups found a common adversary in methane. It\u2019s about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. It\u2019s the dominant component of natural gas, so producers do have an incentive to limit its leaks since it\u2019s a salable product. At COP28, dozens of oil and gas firms committed to ending their methane pollution by 2050. Simply reducing methane output by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 could avert 0.2\u00b0C of warming (0.36\u00b0F) by 2050. But methane is colorless and odorless, making it hard to detect where it\u2019s escaping, and estimates of its emissions vary widely.  These concerns have fertilized the growth of the carbon accounting and verification business. Context Labs, one of the companies presenting at the Agora, has developed software so companies can track emissions across their facilities, sometimes down to individual pieces of hardware like generators or furnaces. The goal is to give companies actionable information about where they need to cut pollution, how they can route their operations to be more carbon efficient, and what assets will be at risk when emissions regulations get stricter.  Not everyone is ready to take these companies at their word, though. The Environmental Defense Fund launched a satellite to track global methane emissions just a few days before CERAWeek began and advertised it on the streets of Houston. EDF plans to publish its findings publicly to spur polluters to act.  There were still points of friction at the oil-soaked conference, as explained by Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco. It\u2019s not just the world\u2019s largest oil company, with nearly four times the market capitalization of ExxonMobil; it\u2019s the fourth-mightiest of all companies, shaping economies around the world. And as a mostly state-run enterprise under an autocratic regime, Saudi Aramco isn\u2019t as swayed by activists or shareholders as a fully investor-owned company like Exxon.  Nasser laid out what he called five \u201chard realities\u201d for the energy transition.  The first is that alternatives to hydrocarbons like wind and solar energy have received decades of research and development and billions of dollars in investment, but still hold single-digit market shares. Second, reducing the carbon intensity of fossil fuels \u2014 particularly through energy efficiency and switching from coal and oil to natural gas \u2014 has delivered greater greenhouse gas emissions reductions than the rise of clean energy. Third is that many alternative energy strategies like electric vehicles are unaffordable for a majority of people around the world. That ties into the fourth point, that most of global energy demand growth in the coming years will occur in developing countries. But despite representing 85 percent of the world\u2019s population, these countries receive a tiny fraction of clean energy investment.  Nasser concluded with his fifth point: that the energy transition strategy of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy needs a reset. \u201cWe should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions,\u201d Nasser said to widespread applause. \u201cWe should ramp up our effort to reduce carbon emissions, improve efficiency and introduce lower carbon solutions. And we should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically competitive, and with the right infrastructure.\u201d  Many activists and other in the energy industry disagree with Nasser\u2019s assessment. However, his comments echo the ongoing rifts at COP meetings between major fossil fuel-producing countries that became rich off oil and those often poorer countries facing the immediate effects of climate change like sea level rise, who want to see fossil fuel consumption zeroed out. It\u2019s led to long, tortuous negotiations over language like \u201cphase down\u201d versus \u201cphase out\u201d and \u201cunabated\u201d emissions from fossil fuels.  But while many zero-carbon technologies are still expensive, so too are the systems required to keep burning coal, oil, and gas in a world where emissions must halt by the middle of the century to meet climate targets. Some of the cheapest carbon capture technologies to date still cost about $40 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, adding up to billions of dollars to capture any meaningful share of the 37.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year.  The US, now the world\u2019s largest oil producer and natural gas exporter, is also in an awkward spot. While pledging to reduce its own emissions, the US is anticipating more fossil fuel exports and financing import facilities in other countries. That includes a doubling of liquefied natural gas shipments abroad by 2030, despite the White House\u2019s pause on new export terminals. \u201cThe whole world needs to transition away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime, we still have to support our friends and allies in their energy needs,\u201d John Podesta, the White House climate adviser who also leads climate diplomacy, told reporters.  Now in an election year, the Biden administration is trying to walk the line between taking credit for low gasoline prices and facilitating more fossil fuel extraction as it faces a challenger who wants to ramp up coal, oil, and natural gas, potentially adding another 4 billion metric tons by 2030 to the US\u2019s already massive greenhouse gas emissions tally.  All the while, the era of low interest rates that drove the massive expansion of both renewables and natural gas in the US in the past decade is ending just as the country needs a massive new buildout of energy production and infrastructure. Financing expenses are getting higher while permitting time and costs remain an obstacle, slowing down the shift to cleaner energy. So while the threats from climate change are more apparent than ever, it\u2019s getting harder to wield the tools to keep it in check, and that means the fuels of the industrial revolution will continue to light the road ahead, for a while at least.

        "onlytext": "Coal, oil, and natural gas producers have found their vision for a low-carbon world. \n\nHOUSTON, Texas \u2014 In a video message projected onto massive screens in a packed conference hall, Sultan al-Jaber, the president of the COP28 climate conference held in the United Arab Emirates last year, graciously accepted a leadership award from one of the world\u2019s biggest energy industry conventions.  Al-Jaber, who when not running UN climate summits is also the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, faced criticism from environmental groups for inviting major oil and gas companies to participate in the international climate negotiations. He also faced scrutiny for his comments that it\u2019s not necessary to eliminate fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century.\n\nBut here in Houston, before a much friendlier crowd, he remained defiant.  \u201cIf the world is going to meet its climate goals, every stakeholder has to act,\u201d al-Jaber said, with a model of a wind turbine on his desk. \u201cEveryone had a seat at the table, everyone was invited to contribute, and everyone did contribute.\u201d \n\nCERAWeek by S&P Global \u2014 an annual conference of oil, gas, coal, renewable, and nuclear energy industries \u2014 returned the invitation, putting the once taboo topic of climate change in its headline.  \u201cIt is no exaggeration to say that [al-Jaber] helped the global community chart pathways to a sustainable future,\u201d said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil history The Prize and the founder of CERAWeek.\n\nThe conference isn\u2019t meant to produce any formal agreements or treaties, but what attendees say on stage and behind closed doors often ripple through the global energy industry.  While only a sliver of the size of the last climate meeting \u2014 more than 8,000 delegates were at CERAWeek compared to more than 80,000 attendees at COP28 \u2014 the conference represents some of the most powerful companies in the world with trillions of dollars at their disposal to shape the future of global energy and the climate.\n\nThe theme this year was \u201cMultidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, climate, technology and geopolitics.\u201d The unwieldy title is an example of how the convention has grown in scope since it started in 1981 and how the industries it represents have begun to redefine their roles in a world constrained by rising average temperatures, yet still primarily dependent on fossil fuels.\n\nWhat was once a low-key meeting of oil and gas executives and analysts to talk frankly and cut deals has become a slick news-making tech conference where attendees are well fed and, after hours, well lubricated by sponsors. Think of it as Davos for the oil and gas set, hosted in the energy capital of the US.\n\n\u201cTwenty years ago you could not have a conversation here about climate change. Full stop,\u201d Mark Brownstein, senior vice president for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who has attended the conference for decades, told Vox.  By now everyone at CERAWeek has gotten the memo on global warming and understood the assignment, at least in rhetoric.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest energy firms have come to a general consensus that the world is shifting toward clean energy \u2014 but that fossil fuels are still going to be necessary for the foreseeable future. \u201cThese truths are not in conflict,\u201d said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. \u201cThe momentum of the clean energy transition is undeniable, even as we are the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.\u201d \n\nEvery talk and panel discussion nodded to the energy transition, toward carbon management, efficiency, and clean tech. When it comes to energy sources \u2014 wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, oil, hydrogen, coal, nuclear, geothermal, and even fusion \u2014 CERAWeek has truly embraced diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nBut even with greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reaching levels not seen in eons and after the hottest year humans have ever measured, the fossil fuel industry whose products are driving climate change sees a bright future for itself. After all, despite the extraordinary expansion of clean energy generation, fossil fuels have only lost a small share of the global energy mix and are still expecting more growth.\n\nThe majors believe that technologies like carbon capture and storage will allow them to continue selling their wares as emissions regulations ratchet down, and that power-devouring technologies like artificial intelligence and growing markets in developing countries will continue to raise demand. By some estimates, data center electricity use is on track to more than double by 2026.\n\nCoal, oil, and natural gas consumption are at or near record highs in many parts of the world and their emissions are currently on track to grow through 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. The world is hungry for BTUs and watts, and the energy industry is eager to serve them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m actually more optimistic today than I\u2019ve ever been in this job,\u201d ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told attendees, noting that COP28 was the first climate conference he has ever attended. But that optimism hasn\u2019t been matched with urgency on climate change, and the industry has a long history of slowing progress.\n\nWhile the language has changed more recently, the oil and gas industry has spent decades thwarting action on climate change, with lobbying, litigation, and misinformation. Exxon\u2019s own scientists produced accurate internal forecasts of rising average temperatures as early as the 1970s while the company published full-page ads in newspapers casting doubt on warming into the late 1990s.\n\nRussia\u2019s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has also put energy security back on the front burner. For some countries, energy security today matters more than climate change tomorrow, leading them to prioritize secure sources, including fossil fuels in some cases. (Energy security wasn\u2019t the only echo of the war \u2014 CERAWeek also helpfully reminded participants in its registration form not to attend if they are subject to sanctions.)\n\nSo while appetites for cleaner energy sources are growing, the stalwarts of the global energy industry have made it clear they aren\u2019t letting go of the fuels that powered their rise. As these companies have grudgingly come to acknowledge climate change, many concerned about global warming have also begun to grapple with the likelihood that fossil fuels aren\u2019t fading away anytime soon.\n\nAnd while most energy companies do envision reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, the current pace is nowhere near fast enough to bend the curve to meet climate goals. The future for the global energy industry is not just brighter, but hotter.\n\nAcross the skybridge from the hotel in the neighboring convention center, CERAWeek hosts what it calls Innovation Agora, where tech entrepreneurs and energy startups pitch their solutions to climate change in glass-walled booths under purple lights. It was once the kids\u2019 table of the conference when it launched in 2017 but has since evolved into a parallel production, a clear reflection of clean energy\u2019s massive growth and immense potential.\n\n\u201cGlobally, clean energy investment has overtaken fossil fuel investment every year since 2016, according to the IEA,\u201d Granholm said. \u201cIn the US, clean energy investment has tripled since 2018.\u201d \n\nThe fossil fuel industry talks less about competition between conventional sources and renewables and more about collaboration between the \u201cmolecule\u201d and the \u201celectron\u201d solution set, as Exxon\u2019s Woods described it. The molecules are the hydrocarbons of coal, oil, and gas and increasingly, hydrogen, while the electrons are those generated by solar panels and wind turbines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not suggesting one\u2019s better than the other one,\u201d Woods said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m suggesting is, we need both, and you need companies who have our scale, our capabilities.\u201d \n\nUnsurprisingly, the \u201cmolecule\u201d companies have their eyes set on the technologies that play to their strengths. Hydrogen, a gas most commonly produced by reforming methane, fits well into the fossil fuel industry\u2019s existing refining, pipeline, storage, and retail infrastructure.\n\nGeothermal, which harnesses heat from beneath the Earth\u2019s surface, draws on the sector\u2019s expertise in geology and drilling. Carbon capture \u2014 from smokestacks, from the ocean, from the air \u2014 gives fossil fuels a way to zero out their emissions, at least on paper, extending them a lifeline in a world where emissions must ratchet down.\n\nIn the US, the Biden administration has set a target of cutting national greenhouse gas emissions in half compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.\n\nUS government incentives are sweetening the deal for cleaner energy technologies. The trio of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have mobilized billions of dollars to research, build, and deploy low-emissions energy systems and the products that enable them.\n\nUnlike past legislative attempts to tackle climate change, these laws are almost all incentives, with no restrictions or caps on greenhouse gases baked in.\n\n\u201cI am very supportive of the IRA, because, as legislated, the IRA focuses on carbon intensity and in theory, [is] technology agnostic,\u201d Woods said.\n\nAs for the villains, the energy industry as well as environmental groups found a common adversary in methane.

        "title": "ExxonMobil wants you to feel responsible for climate change so it doesn\u2019t have to",
        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we\u2019re committed to clarity, truth, and depth \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard. That kind of journalism isn\u2019t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? A new study reveals how the oil company used \u201ccutting-edge propaganda\u201d to focus on fossil fuel consumption. To understand why ExxonMobil has been so effective at shaping the US narrative about climate change in the US for some 40 years, look no further than the words of one of the company\u2019s communications strategists, Mobil Vice President of Public Affairs Herbert Schmertz: \u201dYour objective is to wrap yourself in the good phrases while sticking your opponents with the bad ones,\u201d he wrote in 1986.  From the 1970s through the 1990s, most of the company\u2019s PR efforts focused on casting doubt on the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels was warming the planet. But by the mid-2000s, it was taking a more sophisticated, nuanced approach. \u201cEnergy-saving consumers can make a real difference,\u201d it said in 2007, listing ways consumers can \u201cBe smart about electricity use,\u201d \u201cHeat and cool your home efficiently,\u201d and \u201cImprove your gas mileage\u201d to address climate change. Another ad in 2008 looks to the auto industry: \u201cIt is important we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, too. Improving the efficiency of the vehicles people drive is one way to do so.\u201d There are many examples in ExxonMobil\u2019s advertising materials and other documents right up to 2019, all doing the same thing: Deflecting attention away from the oil company\u2019s role in fueling climate change by supplying fossil fuels and turning attention toward consumer demand for, and dependency on, its products. We now have a comprehensive view of this strategy, thanks to a new peer-reviewed study by Harvard research associate Geoffrey Supran and Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes in the journal One Earth. In a painstaking analysis, they show how hard the oil giant has worked to keep the conversation about climate solutions focused on the consumer, effectively individualizing responsibility for the problem. \u201cNever before has it been proven that fossil fuel propaganda is demonstrably one source of where this [consumer- and demand-focused] mindset has originated from,\u201d Supran told Vox. Blaming the individual user, rather than the producers, is a well-worn tactic of other industries with dangerous products, including tobacco and firearms. In the case of fossil fuel products, individualizing the responsibility for climate change obfuscates the responsibility of companies like Exxon \u2014 one of 20 companies responsible for one-third of energy-related global carbon emissions since 1965 \u2014 to extract fewer fossil fuels and shift to cleaner technologies. And according to Oreskes and Supran, not only has this messaging strategy allowed Exxon to \u201cdownplay its role in the climate crisis,\u201d it also continues to be used \u201cto undermine climate litigation, regulation, and activism.\u201d Supran and Oreskes use a trove of documents that they have combed through in past research, namely a 2017 paper that found ExxonMobil internally acknowledging its products\u2019 role in climate change, while publicly casting doubt on the science. Starting in the late 1970s, the company ran regular advertisements in the New York Times. The researchers looked at those ads as well as more recent reports aimed at investors through 2019 for a total of 212 documents that provide a solid chronology of how the oil company has communicated with the public on climate science. The early ads took a skeptical stance on climate science, but in the 2000s they started to emphasize the uncertainty of risks, rather than the consensus of manmade warming. When ExxonMobil did acknowledge the need to reduce pollution, it disproportionately talked about how much it was doing to address the demand-side of the equation, rather than addressing the obvious other half: the increasing supply. When Supran ran his algorithm to pick up the most frequently used terms and topics in the papers, he was surprised at what they found: The company\u2019s messaging was largely consistent in the advertisements up to 2009 and in reports up to 2019, statistically overusing certain language, like \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cdemand,\u201d to hammer home these themes. In 1997, the company touted helping \u201ccustomers scale back their emissions of carbon dioxide,\u201d while the next year it encouraged the public to \u201cshow a little voluntary \u2018can do.\u2019\u201d A decade later, in 2008, an ad suggested the \u2018\u2018cars and trucks we drive aren\u2019t just vehicles, they\u2019re opportunities to solve the world\u2019s energy and environmental challenges.\u2019\u2019 Throughout this time, ExxonMobil discussed growing fossil fuel demand as an inevitability, saying things like, \u201cOil and gas will be essential to meeting demand through 2030\u201d and \u201cfossil fuels must be relied upon to meet society\u2019s immediate and near-term needs.\u201d The company only acknowledges its own culpability in obscure academic journals and internal memos. One 1982 internal memo writes what the company never admits publicly, that \u201cthe connection between Exxon\u2019s major businesses and the role of fossil fuel combustion in contributing to the increase of atmospheric CO2.\u201d The other trend the Harvard researchers note is how the company shifted to a \u201cFossil Fuel Savior\u201d frame in the mid-2000s. A 2007 company ad notes the \u201cincreasing prosperity in the developing world [will be] the main driver of greater energy demand (and consequently rising CO2 emissions),\u201d which positions the company as another passive bystander in global warming. Asked for comment on the study, Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton called it a conflict of interest, alleging that Oreskes is on retainer for Sher Edling, one of the law firms that has sued Exxon, and that the research was partially funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund, which is also involved in litigation against oil companies. \u201cThis research is clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies,\u201d Norton said. \u201cExxonMobil supports the Paris climate agreement, and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies.\u201d (Supran and Oreskes, in response, said Sher Edling \u201cplayed no role in the paper we published today, nor in any other academic work we have done,\u201d charging that ExxonMobil\u2019s statement was purposely misleading.) Shaming individuals has pretty much always been a part of the climate discourse. Political leaders focus on recycling and consumption of plastics, rather than banning production, and now \u201cflight shame\u201d has taken off as a way to discourage plane travel to tackle the rising footprint of transportation emissions. But shame has a dark side: It can be a distraction that lets key perpetrators of climate change off the hook. Supran and Oreskes don\u2019t have a precise measure of the impact ExxonMobil\u2019s marketing has had on the public discourse \u2014 their methodology doesn\u2019t go that far \u2014 but there\u2019s plenty of anecdotal evidence that policymakers and the media overemphasize personal responsibility instead of systemic political and economic change. \u201cAt the grassroots level, people get accused of being hypocrites all the time,\u201d for flying, driving, or using plastics, also derived from fossil fuels, Supran said. And research from Georgia State University shows how shame messaging can backfire: In a 2020 paper, they showed that in some cases, being told to drive less or change your diet can make people less willing to want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ExxonMobil wasn\u2019t the first oil company to push these narratives. \u201cThe very notion of a personal \u2018carbon footprint,\u2019 for example, was first popularized in 2004-2006 by oil firm BP as part of its $100+ million per year \u2018beyond petroleum\u2019 US media campaign,\u201d Supran and Oreskes write. But ultimately these narratives \u201chamstring us, and they put blinders on us, to the systemic nature of the climate crisis and the importance of taking collective action to address the problem,\u201d Supran said. It\u2019s useful to have some statistical rigor backing up the observations of many academics, activists, and journalists, that by emphasizing demand, oil companies can play the part of innocent bystanders feeding a global hunger for their products. But the more consequential implications for this research may be in the courts. Major oil companies like ExxonMobil are currently facing an onslaught of lawsuits around the world charging that they have broken the law by pushing misinformation and thwarting climate action. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School counted 884 climate cases in 2017 had doubled to 1,550 cases by 2020 in 38 countries (Exxon is not the only subject of all these lawsuits). Just recently, New York City filed a new lawsuit against ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and the American Petroleum Institute for violating the city\u2019s consumer protection laws, another sign the wave of litigation is not slowing down. Supran and Oreskes\u2019s study may be relevant to these lawsuits for a couple of reasons. First, the researchers note that ExxonMobil may be mounting a clever defense against these lawsuits with its greenwashing. One of its defenses actually cited the same logic that appears again and again in its advertising, that climate risks are common knowledge and the company bears no control over how people choose to live. Supran and Oreskes note the example: In 2018, arguing in defense of five oil companies (including ExxonMobil Corp) against a lawsuit brought by California cities seeking climate damages, Chevron lawyer Theodore Boutrous Jr. offered his interpretation of the IPCC\u2019s latest report: \u2018\u2018I think the IPCC does not say it\u2019s the production and extraction of oil that is driving these emissions. It\u2019s the energy use. It\u2019s economic activity that creates demand for energy.\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2018It\u2019s the way people are living their lives.\u2019\u2019 The judge\u2019s dismissal of the case accepted this framing: \u2018\u2018[W]ould it really be fair to now ignore our own responsibility in the use of fossil fuels and place the blame for global warming on those who supplied what we demanded?\u2019\u2019 Even if plaintiffs prove their case, fossil fuel companies can invoke \u2018\u2018affirmative defenses\u2019\u2019\u2014as tobacco companies often have\u2014such as \u2018\u2018common knowledge\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2018assumption of the risk.\u2019\u2019 These respectively argue (1) \u2018\u2018that the plaintiff had engaged in an activity [such as smoking] that involved obvious or widely known risks,\u2019\u2019 and (2) \u2018\u2018that the plaintiff knew about and voluntarily undertook the risk.\u2019\u2019 As Brandt explains it, \u2018\u2018If there was a risk, even though \u2018unproven,\u2019 it nonetheless must be the smoker\u2019s risk, since the smoker had been fully informed of the \u2018controversy.\u2019 The industry had secured the best of both worlds.\u2019\u2019  The second implication is how their research can become a useful tool for climate activists and policymakers looking to hold ExxonMobil responsible. What Supran and Oreskes do in their paper, according to Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law, is \u201cprove quantitatively what has been qualitatively evident for years. ... Oil and gas companies insulated themselves from public scrutiny and regulatory action even as the climate crisis accelerated.\u201d And any proof that oil companies were insulating themselves from climate policies while misleading the public is likely to become useful fodder in the courtroom. \u201cThis evidence will matter not only in the court of public opinion, but in courts of justice around the world faced with questions of industry accountability, culpability, and potential liability for mounting climate impacts,\u201d Muffett said. The message Supran hopes people take from his work isn\u2019t that your actions don\u2019t matter. But governments need to take responsibility and hold the major polluters accountable \u2014 and those policies include a broader mix of solutions that limit the fuels Exxon can extract, axing pipeline projects for transportation, limiting its opportunity to export around the world, and even make companies pay for the damages caused to vulnerable communities. \u201cThis is cutting-edge propaganda coming from an industry with 100 years of experience in pioneering the art of public relations,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people should be aware of what they\u2019re subject to, because otherwise it gets into our bones without us even knowing where it came from.\u201d Update, May 13, 5:54 pm: The story has been updated to include comment from ExxonMobil spokesperson Casey Norton, and Supran\u2019s response to it.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA new study reveals how the oil company used \u201ccutting-edge propaganda\u201d to focus on fossil fuel consumption. To understand why ExxonMobil has been so effective at shaping the US narrative about climate change in the US for some 40 years, look no further than the words of one of the company\u2019s communications strategists, Mobil Vice President of Public Affairs Herbert Schmertz: \u201dYour objective is to wrap yourself in the good phrases while sticking your opponents with the bad ones,\u201d he wrote in 1986.\n\nFrom the 1970s through the 1990s, most of the company\u2019s PR efforts focused on casting doubt on the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels was warming the planet. But by the mid-2000s, it was taking a more sophisticated, nuanced approach. \u201cEnergy-saving consumers can make a real difference,\u201d it said in 2007, listing ways consumers can \u201cBe smart about electricity use,\u201d \u201cHeat and cool your home efficiently,\u201d and \u201cImprove your gas mileage\u201d to address climate change. Another ad in 2008 looks to the auto industry: \u201cIt is important we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, too. Improving the efficiency of the vehicles people drive is one way to do so.\u201d\n\nThere are many examples in ExxonMobil\u2019s advertising materials and other documents right up to 2019, all doing the same thing: Deflecting attention away from the oil company\u2019s role in fueling climate change by supplying fossil fuels and turning attention toward consumer demand for, and dependency on, its products.\n\nWe now have a comprehensive view of this strategy, thanks to a new peer-reviewed study by Harvard research associate Geoffrey Supran and Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes in the journal One Earth. In a painstaking analysis, they show how hard the oil giant has worked to keep the conversation about climate solutions focused on the consumer, effectively individualizing responsibility for the problem.\n\n\u201cNever before has it been proven that fossil fuel propaganda is demonstrably one source of where this [consumer- and demand-focused] mindset has originated from,\u201d Supran told Vox. Blaming the individual user, rather than the producers, is a well-worn tactic of other industries with dangerous products, including tobacco and firearms.\n\nIn the case of fossil fuel products, individualizing the responsibility for climate change obfuscates the responsibility of companies like Exxon \u2014 one of 20 companies responsible for one-third of energy-related global carbon emissions since 1965 \u2014 to extract fewer fossil fuels and shift to cleaner technologies.\n\nAnd according to Oreskes and Supran, not only has this messaging strategy allowed Exxon to \u201cdownplay its role in the climate crisis,\u201d it also continues to be used \u201cto undermine climate litigation, regulation, and activism.\u201d\n\nSupran and Oreskes use a trove of documents that they have combed through in past research, namely a 2017 paper that found ExxonMobil internally acknowledging its products\u2019 role in climate change, while publicly casting doubt on the science. Starting in the late 1970s, the company ran regular advertisements in the New York Times. The researchers looked at those ads as well as more recent reports aimed at investors through 2019 for a total of 212 documents that provide a solid chronology of how the oil company has communicated with the public on climate science.\n\nThe early ads took a skeptical stance on climate science, but in the 2000s they started to emphasize the uncertainty of risks, rather than the consensus of manmade warming. When ExxonMobil did acknowledge the need to reduce pollution, it disproportionately talked about how much it was doing to address the demand-side of the equation, rather than addressing the obvious other half: the increasing supply.\n\nWhen Supran ran his algorithm to pick up the most frequently used terms and topics in the papers, he was surprised at what they found: The company\u2019s messaging was largely consistent in the advertisements up to 2009 and in reports up to 2019, statistically overusing certain language, like \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cdemand,\u201d to hammer home these themes.\n\nIn 1997, the company touted helping \u201ccustomers scale back their emissions of carbon dioxide,\u201d while the next year it encouraged the public to \u201cshow a little voluntary \u2018can do.\u2019\u201d A decade later, in 2008, an ad suggested the \u2018\u2018cars and trucks we drive aren\u2019t just vehicles, they\u2019re opportunities to solve the world\u2019s energy and environmental challenges.\u2019\u2019\n\nThroughout this time, ExxonMobil discussed growing fossil fuel demand as an inevitability, saying things like, \u201cOil and gas will be essential to meeting demand through 2030\u201d and \u201cfossil fuels must be relied upon to meet society\u2019s immediate and near-term needs.\u201d\n\nThe company only acknowledges its own culpability in obscure academic journals and internal memos.

        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we\u2019re committed to clarity, truth, and depth \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard. That kind of journalism isn\u2019t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? More than 30 countries have already broken the link between emissions and economic growth. There\u2019s a common intuition that says we can either have a healthy climate, or a growing economy, but not both. Economic activity, so long as it\u2019s powered by fossil fuels \u2014 which still provides about 80 percent of the world\u2019s energy \u2014 creates greenhouse gas emissions. So it seems to follow that if we want to emit fewer greenhouse gasses, we\u2019re going to have to sacrifice some economic growth, even though raising average income levels is a key part of reducing poverty.  This creates a horrible dilemma, because fighting climate change and fighting poverty are both hugely important goals. As developing countries are making clear at the ongoing COP27 climate summit in Egypt, we really don\u2019t want to shortchange either one. Fortunately, we may not have to.  The evidence comes from more than 30 countries that have already achieved what\u2019s known as \u201cabsolute decoupling.\u201d That means they\u2019ve figured out how to reduce carbon emissions while continuing to grow economically, so those goals are not incompatible. Note that these are not just per capita measures; we\u2019re talking about total emissions and total economies here.  Over at Our World in Data, the researcher Max Roser created a great chart that shows 25 of the countries that have pulled off this feat over the past couple decades. As you look at it, you might be thinking: What about the fact that lots of countries outsource carbon-intensive industries to other, often poorer countries, then import the goods? Surely this chart isn\u2019t taking all that outsourced production into account! In fact, it is. What the chart shows are consumption-based emissions, meaning they account for the emissions caused by stuff that was produced outside a country but consumed inside it.  The obvious question here is: How were these countries able to decarbonize as much as they did without lowering economic growth?  Many factors have made this possible, including technological progress on cheaper renewables and new regulations on air pollution, which enable countries to reduce the greenhouse gas intensity of their economy \u2014 the amount of carbon embedded in each economic buck. Another key part of the picture has been putting a price on carbon, so that those who cause emissions have to pay for them. Carbon pricing is based on a simple idea \u2014 if the price of a product goes up, consumption goes down \u2014 and it\u2019s turned out to be very effective in countries like Sweden, Germany, and the UK. The countries in the chart show that there doesn\u2019t have to be a tradeoff between reducing emissions and growing the economy, as many economists and laypeople once assumed. And it\u2019s not just that emissions-reducing policies are not fundamentally hostile to the economy. In fact, these policies can actually boost economic growth in the coming decades. Investing in climate change mitigation now means we\u2019ll have to spend less in the future \u2014 on rebuilding after fires and floods, on coping with premature deaths and the lost productivity that results from them, and more.  That means, as Roser put it over at Our World in Data, \u201cFighting climate change is not just compatible with fighting poverty, the two goals \u2014 to reduce emissions and to increase economic growth \u2014 actually strengthen each other.\u201d Or at least, they can, with the right policies in place.  Although we know decoupling is possible, a big question remains: Will it be enough to reduce emissions as fast as we need to \u2014 meaning, fast enough to stave off the climate emergency? After all, while some relatively wealthy countries are decoupling, other countries are increasing their emissions.  Notably, most carbon emissions in the coming decades will be coming from emerging economies \u2014 like India or China \u2014 which will have mounting energy needs as they develop into middle-income countries. You don\u2019t see those countries on the chart above, and you might ask whether it\u2019s even possible for them to achieve decoupling anytime soon if they want to improve standards of living for their populations. (Despite the sheer size of its economy, China\u2019s per-capita GDP is around $21,000 \u2014 less than a third that of the US \u2014 while India\u2019s is just around $8,000.)  But there\u2019s some room for optimism here, too.  Let\u2019s look at India. According to research from the World Resources Institute, India doesn\u2019t have to choose between climate action and its economy. By putting in place the right policies \u2014 for instance, phasing in a carbon tax \u2014 it could cut its projected emissions to one-third and achieve a GDP that\u2019s 1.5 percent higher compared to business-as-usual by 2050. Along the way it would also create 40 million new jobs and avert 9.4 million premature deaths, as reducing the use of fossil fuels would lead to a drop in harmful air pollutants.  This wouldn\u2019t happen overnight. There are some short-term costs associated with moving away from fossil fuels and building clean-energy technologies. But it\u2019s an investment worth making, since it would soon lead to net savings for the country. In fact, the researchers\u2019 analysis finds that the savings from avoiding fossil fuel use would start to outweigh the cost of clean technologies within this decade. By 2050, India could be looking at net savings of $965 billion!  India\u2019s clean energy transformation is already underway. Some experts say that the low-carbon development pathway it creates for itself can serve as a blueprint for other developing economies.  Meanwhile, in China, emissions are expected to peak before 2030, thanks to the gigantic build-out of clean energy there. The country is rapidly adopting wind and solar power and embracing electric vehicles. \u201cChina looks like it\u2019s going to be the first big middle-income country to absolutely decouple \u2014 in the next five or six years, hopefully,\u201d Zeke Hausfather, the climate research lead at Stripe and a research scientist at Berkeley Earth, told me. Some developing countries \u2014 say, in sub-Saharan Africa \u2014 will probably need to keep relying on fossil fuels for certain sectors of their economies over the next few decades. But there\u2019s promise there, too. As climate and energy experts from the Breakthrough Institute note in Foreign Policy: Africa, where the majority of the world\u2019s population growth will occur over the rest of this century, has abundant natural gas and hydroelectric resources. That could allow Africa to leapfrog coal, the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel, even while it uses oil and gas in key sectors of its economy. All of this explains why, for the first time, the International Energy Agency recently announced that it expects total fossil fuel use to peak and then decline around 2027. That\u2019s just five years away. In its annual World Energy Outlook, it emphasizes just how momentous this is: \u201cGlobal fossil fuel use has risen alongside GDP since the start of the industrial revolution in the 18th century: putting this rise into reverse while continuing to expand the global economy will be a pivotal moment in energy history.\u201d Likewise, Hausfather says that even though we currently have few examples of decoupling among low- or middle-income countries (which tend to focus more on energy-intensive manufacturing), it\u2019s just a matter of time before decoupling becomes the norm worldwide.  But how much time? Will that moment come fast enough to avoid extremely dangerous levels of warming? There is no preordained answer. \u201cIt depends on how quickly we make [clean energy] technology cheap,\u201d Hausfather told me. \u201cAnd political will certainly matters a lot, both in terms of making the technology cheap \u2014 it\u2019s government investments that scale these things \u2014 and in speeding up the transition and pushing back against vested interests that might slow it down.\u201d It should go without saying that the billions of people living in the world\u2019s poorest countries deserve a shot at escaping poverty. They deserve to see their incomes increase to a decent level, so they can access things like medicine, childcare, and education.  As Roser explains, there are two ways people\u2019s income can increase:  average income can increase over time, that is called economic growth and inequality can decline so that the poorest people get closer to the average income in that country When thinking about any country\u2019s path to decoupling, it makes sense to look at both of these. In rich countries like the US, where the size of the economic pie is huge, a lot could be achieved by just slicing it up more equally. Whether these countries should also keep treating economic growth as a policy priority \u2014 or whether they should slow, stop, or even shrink their economies \u2014 is a question at the heart of the fiery \u201cdegrowth\u201d debate. Whatever you think about that question, it\u2019s important to realize that it\u2019s a totally separate question from what the world\u2019s poorest countries need to do. The key thing to understand here is that for low-income countries, tackling inequality alone will not be enough to address poverty. In a country like Madagascar, say, or Zambia, the economic pie is so small that it won\u2019t be enough to meet everyone\u2019s needs, no matter how equally you slice it.  One way to solve this would be a redistribution of incomes from richer countries to poorer countries. Directly transferring money to poorer countries is a great thing to do, and there are organizations that make it possible for us, as individuals, to do that very effectively. But large-scale global redistribution seems, unfortunately, very unlikely to happen anytime soon. After all, data shows that most wealthy countries aren\u2019t even willing to spend 0.7 percent of their GDP on aid. So we shouldn\u2019t hold our breath for them to agree to give up even bigger shares of their wealth. And while climate reparations to developing countries are a major topic at the ongoing COP27 climate summit, that topic is being carefully avoided by some richer countries like the US, which has failed to even make good on its earlier climate finance promises. There\u2019s no way around it, then: The poorest countries need to grow economically. And it would be monumentally unjust for the richest countries \u2014 which got the world into the climate crisis to begin with \u2014 to expect the poorest countries to forgo that growth.  So, the hope is not that the poorest countries won\u2019t grow. The hope is that they will grow and keep emissions down, and that before long they\u2019ll feature on a new chart showing all the countries that have achieved decoupling.

        "onlytext": "More than 30 countries have already broken the link between emissions and economic growth. There\u2019s a common intuition that says we can either have a healthy climate, or a growing economy, but not both. Economic activity, so long as it\u2019s powered by fossil fuels \u2014 which still provides about 80 percent of the world\u2019s energy \u2014 creates greenhouse gas emissions. So it seems to follow that if we want to emit fewer greenhouse gasses, we\u2019re going to have to sacrifice some economic growth, even though raising average income levels is a key part of reducing poverty.\n\nThis creates a horrible dilemma, because fighting climate change and fighting poverty are both hugely important goals. As developing countries are making clear at the ongoing COP27 climate summit in Egypt, we really don\u2019t want to shortchange either one.\n\nFortunately, we may not have to.\n\nThe evidence comes from more than 30 countries that have already achieved what\u2019s known as \u201cabsolute decoupling.\u201d That means they\u2019ve figured out how to reduce carbon emissions while continuing to grow economically, so those goals are not incompatible.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The fossil fuel industry\u2019s carbon capture bamboozle, explained. This story was published in partnership with Drilled, a global multimedia reporting project focused on climate accountability, and was supported by the Pulitzer Center. This spring, Democrats wrapped up a nearly three-year investigation into the fossil fuel industry\u2019s role in climate disinformation, and asked the Department of Justice to pick up where they left off. In House and Senate Democrats\u2019 final report and hearing, investigators concluded that major oil companies had not only misled the public on climate change for decades, but also were continuing to misinform them about the industry\u2019s preferred climate \u201csolutions\u201d\u2014 particularly biofuels and carbon capture.  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who spearheaded the investigation, also accused oil companies of \u201cobstructing\u201d the investigation, submitting few documents, and redacting much of what they did send. One ExxonMobil employee who spoke with Drilled and Vox under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described what the company sent as \u201ca truly random assortment of unimportant documents.\u201d  But there was at least one notable exception in the form of a report detailing the company\u2019s projections for the future of carbon capture technology.  If you\u2019ve read the New York Times recently, or seen this ad on Politico\u2019s website or heard it on one of its podcasts, or listened to the Planet Money podcast, you may have noticed the industry\u2019s relentlessly positive marketing of carbon capture, which aims to collect and store CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial and fossil fuel extraction facilities, so they don\u2019t add to global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said carbon capture might be necessary to reduce the emissions of certain \u201chard to abate\u201d sectors like steel, concrete, and some chemical manufacturing, but noted that in the best-case scenario, with carbon capture technology working flawlessly and deployed at large scale, it could only account for a little over 2 percent of global carbon emissions reductions by 2030. That hasn\u2019t stopped major oil companies from claiming that carbon capture and storage \u201cwill be essential for helping society achieve net-zero emissions,\u201d that they are delivering \u201ccarbon capture for American industry,\u201d working on reducing emissions in their own businesses (also referred to as \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d), and delivering \u201cheavy industry with low emissions.\u201d But internal documents obtained during the federal investigation, as well as information that industry whistleblowers shared with Drilled and Vox, reveal an industry that is decidedly more realistic about the emissions-reduction potential of carbon capture and storage technology, or CCS, than it presents publicly.  In 2018, the oil and gas company Shell released an updated energy scenario, a forecast that served as a standard for the rest of the oil industry, in which it laid out what the Washington Post called a \u201cradical\u201d new approach on climate. Beginning in 1965, Shell pioneered the now-common practice of \u201cscenario planning\u201d for oil companies: mapping out what the industry and the world are likely to look like in the future; other oil companies will still often compare their scenarios to Shell\u2019s.  Exxon\u2019s own internal 2018 scenario comparison was included in the most recent batch of documents handed over to Senate and House investigators. In it, ExxonMobil compared its future projections with Shell\u2019s rosiest forecast for the energy transition. Buried in a chart in that projection is ExxonMobil\u2019s belief about the global potential for CCS.  Even without the massive stamp on this page marking it as part of a set of documents obtained by congressional subpoena, these graphs would be difficult to read. The one above compares the projected number of CCS units in Shell\u2019s scenario versus the number projected by ExxonMobil, while the graph on the right compares the two companies\u2019 forecasts for future CO2 emissions.  While Shell\u2019s optimistic projection envisions 10,000 large-scale CCS facilities operational by 2070, with more than 2,500 facilities by 2050, Exxon predicts somewhere between 250 and 500 facilities by 2050. Elsewhere in the scenario, Exxon also envisions that \u201cglobal scale is limited\u201d for CCS and hydrogen tech by 2050.  Exxon\u2019s past projections were much more in line with what critics of CCS have been saying for years. The IPCC, for example, has said that even if realized at its full announced potential, CCS would only account for about 2.4 percent of the world\u2019s carbon mitigation by 2030. In its fact sheet on CCS, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Ohio that produces market-based research on the energy transition, states: \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that not one single CCS project has ever reached its target CO2 capture rate.\u201d  Stanford University researcher Mark Jacobson said that because it also requires energy and materials to function, CCS attached to a fossil-fueled power plant is still worse for the climate than replacing fossil energy with renewables. \u201cThey actually increase carbon dioxide emissions by doing this, in addition to increasing air pollution,\u201d he said, referencing a study he conducted in 2019 quantifying the lifecycle CO2 emissions of various carbon capture scenarios. Even when CCS is powered by wind, Jacobson said it\u2019s not worth doing, from a climate perspective. \u201cIf you just used wind to replace coal in the first place, you\u2019d get a higher reduction in CO2 emissions,\u201d he said.  And oil giants themselves have been hedging on the technology for years, despite marketing its potential. When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed requiring that power plants install CCS in its rules for power plants, for example, both fossil fuel companies and utilities expressed far less faith in the technology in their public comments on the rule than they have in their ads about carbon capture. In Exxon\u2019s public comment, the company encouraged the agency to reduce its requirements around capture efficiency from 95 percent to 75 percent, which is more in line with the actual performance of existing CCS projects.  \u201cLast year, when the first EPA power plant rule was released, it was going to mandate either using CCS on a power plant in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to take some action that would be equivalent to adding CCS, and the response from industry was \u2018Hey, the tech is really not proven,\u2019\u201d said David Schlissel, director of resource planning analysis for IEEFA. \u201cMany, many comments from oil companies and utilities, in response to both the initial EPA rule and the current one, were saying this tech really doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Exxon\u2019s low internal projections for CCS back in 2018 map to the company\u2019s own experience with the technology, too. To date, the only \u201csuccessful\u201d carbon capture project Exxon points to in its materials is its LaBarge Shute Creek gas facility in Wyoming. The Shute Creek facility is often referenced by the industry in general as a successful large and longstanding CCS project. On paper, LaBarge is responsible for around 40 percent of the total carbon emissions ever captured in the world. But the details tell a different story.  According to Exxon\u2019s own disclosures and an analysis conducted by IEEFA in 2022, only around 3 percent of the carbon captured there (roughly 6 million tonnes) has been permanently sequestered underground. Of the rest of the 240 million tonnes of carbon emitted over the facility\u2019s first 35 years in operation, half has been sold to various oilfield operators for enhanced oil recovery, or EOR \u2014 a process by which oil companies inject carbon underground to get more oil out \u2014 and approximately 120 million tonnes has been vented into the atmosphere. When asked to comment for this story about its 2018 scenario plan and overall record on CCS, ExxonMobil sent the following statement by email: \u201cFalse narratives that downplay our CCS efforts deliberately fail to recognize the strides we\u2019re making in our Low Carbon Solutions business. Referencing one possible scenario from over six years ago does not represent our business outlook. We continuously evaluate our business plan based on market conditions.\u201d Exxon pointed to its public-facing 2023 Global Outlook as its most current thinking on the potential of carbon capture. That report states: \u201cCarbon capture and storage is a proven and safe technology that reduces emissions from manufacturing and power generation.\u201d But in commenting on its scenario plan, Exxon\u2019s spokesperson spoke only to \u201cmarket conditions\u201d and its shifting \u201cbusiness outlook,\u201d not to the technology itself. The business outlook and market conditions for CCS have changed because of an increased tax credit for CCS that oil companies, including Exxon, lobbied for \u2014 and, according to the documents subpoenaed by federal investigators, heavily influenced \u2014 and that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced in 2021 as part of the negotiations that saw the Biden administration\u2019s proposed \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d legislation morph into the Inflation Reduction Act. That\u2019s thanks to major changes to the CCS tax credit known as 45Q, which started out in 2008 paying $10 for every metric ton of carbon sequestered and now pays as much as $85 per metric ton, and up to $60 per ton stored and then used for EOR. Suddenly, EOR is CCS and CCS is profitable.  \u201cThere is no cap on 45Q and stored emissions are entirely self-reported,\u201d Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, said.  The credit nominally requires companies to verify their claims, but aside from some specific requirements to ensure condensed CO2 doesn\u2019t wind up in groundwater, the EPA is not verifying how much carbon is actually sequestered by these projects.  When asked about verification of carbon stored under the 45Q tax credit, the EPA told Drilled and Vox that it \u201cdoes not implement the Section 45Q tax credit program and is not privy to taxpayer data,\u201d and that questions about how tax claims are verified should be directed to the IRS. The IRS confirmed that it ensures companies claiming the credit have filed paperwork outlining their claims, including a lifecycle analysis, but that it does not have the scientific or technical expertise to verify that the amount of carbon claimed is actually being permanently sequestered. \u201cWhat the IPCC actually said in its mitigation report was that carbon capture might be necessary for hard-to-abate industries, but that it\u2019s one of the most expensive options and it only equates to small emissions reductions,\u201d said Paul Blackburn, an environmental lawyer and advisor to the Bold Alliance, a nonprofit network of frontline communities focused on protecting land and water. \u201cSo we\u2019re doing the most expensive, least applicable thing first rather than cheapest, easiest things first, at great expense to taxpayers and with no analysis of net climate benefit.\u201d But even before the creation of a remarkably generous tax credit, and despite their own internal projections or challenges with the technology, major oil companies painted a rosy picture of CCS. Emails obtained by federal investigators show that Shell pulled together an \u201cAlliance of Champions\u201d to promote CCS, and BP worked with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative to develop what it called \u201cCCS enabling narratives,\u201d while Exxon began promoting itself as a leader in carbon capture.  In the last five years, Exxon has produced multiple pro-CCS brochures and ads, comparing the carbon capture potential at industrial plants to the carbon sequestration of actual plants and trees. An NPR sponsorship from 2018, for example, describes ExxonMobil as \u201cthe company that believes that carbon capture technologies are critical for lowering global CO2 emissions.\u201d  The company even worked on a series of kids\u2019 videos touting CCS. In one subpoenaed email, Exxon executives asked the creative team working on the kids\u2019 series to steer away from the idea that carbon is bad or that carbon capture is difficult. \u201cDe-emphasize concept that catching carbon is difficult or hard,\u201d the feedback reads.  Yet that is precisely the company\u2019s experience with CCS, according to several current and former Exxon staffers who agreed to speak with Drilled and Vox on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Some of them were involved in the early days of researching CCS as a potential climate solution at Exxon, which they said only began in earnest in 2018, the same year that the 45Q tax credit first increased (from $10 for every metric ton of sequestered carbon to about $50 per metric ton).  The company\u2019s experience before then, the sources said, was entirely focused on enhanced oil recovery \u2014 the process of injecting CO2 into a separate well to increase enough pressure in a reservoir to push additional oil out of a production well. While enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, does sequester carbon \u2014 some of it stays underground after it\u2019s been injected \u2014 experts say the process could release 40 percent of the CO2 back into the air, and the oil it helps to get out of the ground also generates CO2 emissions when it\u2019s burned. Exxon is not the only one that embraced EOR for years before repositioning it as a climate solution. The industry has known for decades that compressed carbon works really well to vacuum up any remaining oil from porous rock, but it\u2019s expensive to store and transport carbon. The industry\u2019s embrace of natural gas helped drive down costs a bit, because while the finished product might be \u201clow carbon,\u201d gas often comes out of the ground bringing quite a bit of CO2 with it. That CO2 needs to be stripped out to make natural gas, a process called \u201cgas sweetening,\u201d leaving companies with excess CO2.  Still, the process of storing and transporting it remained expensive, so it didn\u2019t always make financial sense to do EOR. Now, with investor-owned oil companies like Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell hurtling toward an inevitable decline in production rates \u2014 an inflection point referred to as \u201cpeak oil\u201d \u2014 they need EOR more than ever. By rebranding it as a climate solution and tying it to a tax credit, they\u2019ve not just made the process cheaper, they\u2019ve created a new revenue stream \u2014 called Low Carbon Solutions at Exxon and Shell, Gas & Low Carbon Energy at BP, and Lower Carbon at Chevron.  The 45Q tax credit revenue will also make it feasible for these new business units to supply carbon capture where it might genuinely be needed, on facilities with hard-to-abate emissions, like concrete, steel, and ammonia plants. But the vast majority of carbon that US taxpayers are paying oil companies to capture will either be going toward generating more oil, or would have greater emissions reductions benefits had the companies opted not to drill for gas in the first place. The above emails, showing ExxonMobil employees\u2019 conversations about marketing carbon capture and storage to an audience of children and Gen Z consumers, were originally obtained by congressional subpoena to a House committee and have been reproduced here by Drilled and Vox. According to the International Energy Agency, using \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d carbon \u2014 the CO2 that comes up with methane as part of natural gas, for example \u2014 for EOR as opposed to \u201canthropogenic CO2,\u201d the emissions captured from a facility like a power plant or factory, \u201cclearly provides no benefit in terms of emissions intensity.\u201d That\u2019s because absent the drilling in the first place, there would be no CO2 or methane emissions in those cases. In the United States, more than 70 percent of the CO2 injected underground as part of the EOR process is from natural sources. That\u2019s true of Exxon\u2019s showcase facility \u2014 the Shute Creek facility in LaBarge, Wyoming \u2014 as well. The CO2 source there is the gas that\u2019s being drilled. ExxonMobil calls this \u201canthropogenic CO2,\u201d but when pressed, a spokesperson told Drilled it\u2019s generated by the separation process, or gas sweetening. In other words, absent the gas drilling, there would be no CO2 emissions at the site in the first place. Despite that, when ExxonMobil talks about itself as the \u201cglobal leader\u201d in CCS, pointing to its \u201cmore than 30 years capturing and storing carbon dioxide,\u201d and the fact that it has captured more CO2 than any other company in the world, it is referring to LaBarge, which has been in operation since 1986.  According to a case study from MIT, where Exxon has long funded research on CCS and other industry-friendly \u201cclimate solutions,\u201d from 1986 to 2008, LaBarge reinjected about 400,000 tonnes of CO2 a year back into the reservoir from which it came, and vented 180 million cubic feet of CO2 per day from the facility\u2019s smokestacks. In 2008, it was ordered by Wyoming\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to reduce its vented CO2 emissions, which it did by building out a carbon capture system that redirected CO2 into pipelines for enhanced oil recovery.  In 2022, a study from IEEFA found that LaBarge was selling half of its captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery and venting the rest. This means that millions of tonnes of carbon the company claimed to have \u201ccaptured\u201d were ultimately emitted. Climate scientists say CCS connected to fossil fuel use or production delivers little benefit when it comes to tackling climate change, period.  \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to use CCS to prolong our use of fossil fuels, especially to produce electricity,\u201d said David Ho, professor at University of Hawaii and senior researcher at Columbia University. \u201cThe argument in favor of enhanced oil recovery is often that if they weren\u2019t using this captured CO2, they\u2019d be using some other CO2, but I don\u2019t think you can call anything where you\u2019re getting more oil out of the ground to burn a climate solution.\u201d  Yet, so far, major oil companies have struggled to deploy CCS technology in any other capacity. \u201cWhen we talk about the failure of CCS, we generally talk about capturing, not storage, but when you look at capacity and how much has actually been sequestered, it\u2019s very little,\u201d Ho said.  When CO2 is actually sequestered underground, there\u2019s no guarantee it stays there. \u201cCO2 has a way of moving through the air, of leaking through pipelines, and because we have no cradle-to-grave tracking, we have no way of actually knowing how much is leaking, how much is really being collected, how much is hitting the wellhead, and how much is really staying underground,\u201d Raffensperger said. That\u2019s not just concerning from a climate perspective, but from a public health perspective as well. Raffensperger notes that the pipelines built to transport condensed carbon from oil fields to storage facilities, or to other oil fields for EOR, are surrounded by \u201ckill zones.\u201d  \u201cThese are not your grandmother\u2019s pipelines,\u201d Raffensperger said. \u201cThey could be lethal. We talk about the kill zone or a fatality zone around a CO2 pipeline. We don\u2019t talk about that with oil and gas pipelines. These are uniquely dangerous and underregulated.\u201d Following a 2020 CO2 leak and explosion in Satartia, Mississippi, that abruptly stopped cars on roadways, caused widespread dizziness and nausea, and sent several residents to the hospital, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration began looking into rules for CO2 pipelines. They were set to finalize that rule this summer, pending review by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, but that deadline has been extended to fall 2024. The lack of finalized safety regulations has not stopped the permitting of CO2 pipelines, though. The Summit pipeline, a massive project that would carry carbon across five states, just got the go-ahead in June for the first step of its construction process in Iowa: seizing land through eminent domain to make way for the pipeline.  According to current and former Exxon employees, the company\u2019s efforts to explore the \u201cS\u201d part of the CCS equation \u2014 storage, or sequestration \u2014 only began when it pulled together a team of technical experts to look for weaknesses in a 2018 US Geological Survey assessment that showed enormous potential for CCS.  \u201cThey thought the USGS was overly optimistic [about the potential of CCS] and they wanted us to basically bring industry technical expertise in to tell them their projections were overblown,\u201d one Exxon staffer said. The team brought together to study CCS was then tasked with running an experiment to see if it was even possible to permanently store captured carbon. When the study showed that it was indeed possible, current and former Exxon staffers told Vox and Drilled the company\u2019s executives were \u201csurprised.\u201d To truly sell CCS as a climate solution, Exxon had to show that storage at scale was feasible. Former employees told us that at the end of the last decade, executives came up with a prioritized list of the company\u2019s export and import terminals and refineries where it might be relatively easy to attach CCS. As of this year, none of those projects have been built (though the company did publicly announce in late 2023 that it was working on a fuel-cell-powered carbon capture and hydrogen project at its Rotterdam refinery, one of the options on that list).  While it hasn\u2019t managed to build commercial-scale carbon storage itself, Exxon did acquire enhanced oil recovery company Denbury in 2023, which brought 1,300 miles of CO2 pipelines and 15 onshore carbon storage sites under Exxon\u2019s control. Again, this system is focused on enhanced oil recovery.  \u201cCCS is a proven and safe technology that experts agree is pivotal to achieving net zero,\u201d an ExxonMobil spokesperson said in response to a request for comment for this story. \u201cWe\u2019re making progress in our Low Carbon Solutions business, with current plans to capture and permanently store more CO2 than any other company.\u201d Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has called the industry\u2019s plan to offset its emissions with carbon capture \u201cfantasy.\u201d  But the US government is all in on that fantasy now. \u201c[The carbon capture tax credit] 45Q is not based on net climate benefit or net CO2 reductions, it\u2019s based on gross CO2 capture,\u201d Blackburn, the environmental lawyer, said. \u201cWhy would you think making carbon a commodity would reduce CO2 emissions? It\u2019s like the opposite of carbon tax, we\u2019re actually paying them to produce more of it.\u201d Ugochi Anyaka-Oluigbo, Royce Kurmelovs, and Molly Taft also contributed reporting to this story.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe fossil fuel industry\u2019s carbon capture bamboozle, explained.\n\nThis spring, Democrats wrapped up a nearly three-year investigation into the fossil fuel industry\u2019s role in climate disinformation, and asked the Department of Justice to pick up where they left off. In House and Senate Democrats\u2019 final report and hearing, investigators concluded that major oil companies had not only misled the public on climate change for decades, but also were continuing to misinform them about the industry\u2019s preferred climate \u201csolutions\u201d\u2014 particularly biofuels and carbon capture.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who spearheaded the investigation, also accused oil companies of \u201cobstructing\u201d the investigation, submitting few documents, and redacting much of what they did send. One ExxonMobil employee who spoke with Drilled and Vox under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described what the company sent as \u201ca truly random assortment of unimportant documents.\u201d \n\nBut there was at least one notable exception in the form of a report detailing the company\u2019s projections for the future of carbon capture technology.\n\nIf you\u2019ve read the New York Times recently, or seen this ad on Politico\u2019s website or heard it on one of its podcasts, or listened to the Planet Money podcast, you may have noticed the industry\u2019s relentlessly positive marketing of carbon capture, which aims to collect and store CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial and fossil fuel extraction facilities, so they don\u2019t add to global warming.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said carbon capture might be necessary to reduce the emissions of certain \u201chard to abate\u201d sectors like steel, concrete, and some chemical manufacturing, but noted that in the best-case scenario, with carbon capture technology working flawlessly and deployed at large scale, it could only account for a little over 2 percent of global carbon emissions reductions by 2030.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped major oil companies from claiming that carbon capture and storage \u201cwill be essential for helping society achieve net-zero emissions,\u201d that they are delivering \u201ccarbon capture for American industry,\u201d working on reducing emissions in their own businesses (also referred to as \u201ccarbon intensity\u201d), and delivering \u201cheavy industry with low emissions.\u201d\n\nBut internal documents obtained during the federal investigation, as well as information that industry whistleblowers shared with Drilled and Vox, reveal an industry that is decidedly more realistic about the emissions-reduction potential of carbon capture and storage technology, or CCS, than it presents publicly.\n\nIn 2018, the oil and gas company Shell released an updated energy scenario, a forecast that served as a standard for the rest of the oil industry, in which it laid out what the Washington Post called a \u201cradical\u201d new approach on climate. Beginning in 1965, Shell pioneered the now-common practice of \u201cscenario planning\u201d for oil companies: mapping out what the industry and the world are likely to look like in the future; other oil companies will still often compare their scenarios to Shell\u2019s.\n\nExxon\u2019s own internal 2018 scenario comparison was included in the most recent batch of documents handed over to Senate and House investigators. In it, ExxonMobil compared its future projections with Shell\u2019s rosiest forecast for the energy transition. Buried in a chart in that projection is ExxonMobil\u2019s belief about the global potential for CCS.\n\nWhile Shell\u2019s optimistic projection envisions 10,000 large-scale CCS facilities operational by 2070, with more than 2,500 facilities by 2050, Exxon predicts somewhere between 250 and 500 facilities by 2050. Elsewhere in the scenario, Exxon also envisions that \u201cglobal scale is limited\u201d for CCS and hydrogen tech by 2050.\n\nExxon\u2019s past projections were much more in line with what critics of CCS have been saying for years. The IPCC, for example, has said that even if realized at its full announced potential, CCS would only account for about 2.4 percent of the world\u2019s carbon mitigation by 2030.\n\nIn its fact sheet on CCS, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Ohio that produces market-based research on the energy transition, states: \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that not one single CCS project has ever reached its target CO2 capture rate.\u201d\n\nStanford University researcher Mark Jacobson said that because it also requires energy and materials to function, CCS attached to a fossil-fueled power plant is still worse for the climate than replacing fossil energy with renewables. \u201cThey actually increase carbon dioxide emissions by doing this, in addition to increasing air pollution,\u201d he said, referencing a study he conducted in 2019 quantifying the lifecycle CO2 emissions of various carbon capture scenarios.\n\nEven when CCS is powered by wind, Jacobson said it\u2019s not worth doing, from a climate perspective. \u201cIf you just used wind to replace coal in the first place, you\u2019d get a higher reduction in CO2 emissions,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd oil giants themselves have been hedging on the technology for years, despite marketing its potential.

condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation.\n\nSome of them were involved in the early days of researching CCS as a potential climate solution at Exxon, which they said only began in earnest in 2018, the same year that the 45Q tax credit first increased (from $10 for every metric ton of sequestered carbon to about $50 per metric ton).\n\nThe company\u2019s experience before then, the sources said, was entirely focused on enhanced oil recovery \u2014 the process of injecting CO2 into a separate well to increase enough pressure in a reservoir to push additional oil out of a production well.\n\nWhile enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, does sequester carbon \u2014 some of it stays underground after it\u2019s been injected \u2014 experts say the process could release 40 percent of the CO2 back into the air, and the oil it helps to get out of the ground also generates CO2 emissions when it\u2019s burned.\n\nExxon is not the only one that embraced EOR for years before repositioning it as a climate solution.\n\nThe industry has known for decades that compressed carbon works really well to vacuum up any remaining oil from porous rock, but it\u2019s expensive to store and transport carbon.\n\nThe industry\u2019s embrace of natural gas helped drive down costs a bit, because while the finished product might be \u201clow carbon,\u201d gas often comes out of the ground bringing quite a bit of CO2 with it.\n\nThat CO2 needs to be stripped out to make natural gas, a process called \u201cgas sweetening,\u201d leaving companies with excess CO2.\n\nStill, the process of storing and transporting it remained expensive, so it didn\u2019t always make financial sense to do EOR.\n\nNow, with investor-owned oil companies like Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell hurtling toward an inevitable decline in production rates \u2014 an inflection point referred to as \u201cpeak oil\u201d \u2014 they need EOR more than ever.\n\nBy rebranding it as a climate solution and tying it to a tax credit, they\u2019ve not just made the process cheaper, they\u2019ve created a new revenue stream \u2014 called Low Carbon Solutions at Exxon and Shell, Gas & Low Carbon Energy at BP, and Lower Carbon at Chevron.\n\nThe 45Q tax credit revenue will also make it feasible for these new business units to supply carbon capture where it might genuinely be needed, on facilities with hard-to-abate emissions, like concrete, steel, and ammonia plants.\n\nBut the vast majority of carbon that US taxpayers are paying oil companies to capture will either be going toward generating more oil, or would have greater emissions reductions benefits had the companies opted not to drill for gas in the first place.\n\nThe above emails, showing ExxonMobil employees\u2019 conversations about marketing carbon capture and storage to an audience of children and Gen Z consumers, were originally obtained by congressional subpoena to a House committee and have been reproduced here by Drilled and Vox.\n\nAccording to the International Energy Agency, using \u201cnaturally occurring\u201d carbon \u2014 the CO2 that comes up with methane as part of natural gas, for example \u2014 for EOR as opposed to \u201canthropogenic CO2,\u201d the emissions captured from a facility like a power plant or factory, \u201cclearly provides no benefit in terms of emissions intensity.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because absent the drilling in the first place, there would be no CO2 or methane emissions in those cases.\n\nIn the United States, more than 70 percent of the CO2 injected underground as part of the EOR process is from natural sources.\n\nThat\u2019s true of Exxon\u2019s showcase facility \u2014 the Shute Creek facility in LaBarge, Wyoming \u2014 as well.\n\nThe CO2 source there is the gas that\u2019s being drilled.\n\nExxonMobil calls this \u201canthropogenic CO2,\u201d but when pressed, a spokesperson told Drilled it\u2019s generated by the separation process, or gas sweetening.\n\nIn other words, absent the gas drilling, there would be no CO2 emissions at the site in the first place.\n\nDespite that, when ExxonMobil talks about itself as the \u201cglobal leader\u201d in CCS, pointing to its \u201cmore than 30 years capturing and storing carbon dioxide,\u201d and the fact that it has captured more CO2 than any other company in the world, it is referring to LaBarge, which has been in operation since 1986.\n\nAccording to a case study from MIT, where Exxon has long funded research on CCS and other industry-friendly \u201cclimate solutions,\u201d from 1986 to 2008, LaBarge reinjected about 400,000 tonnes of CO2 a year back into the reservoir from which it came, and vented 180 million cubic feet of CO2 per day from the facility\u2019s smokestacks.\n\nIn 2008, it was ordered by Wyoming\u2019s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to reduce its vented CO2 emissions, which it did by building out a carbon capture system that redirected CO2 into pipelines for enhanced oil recovery.\n\nIn 2022, a study from IEEFA found that LaBarge was selling half of its captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery and venting the rest.\n\nThis means that millions of tonnes of carbon the company claimed to have \u201ccaptured\u201d were ultimately emitted.\n\nClimate scientists say CCS connected to fossil fuel use or production delivers little benefit when it comes to tackling climate change, period.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to use CCS to prolong our use of fossil fuels, especially to produce electricity,\u201d said David Ho, professor at University of Hawaii and senior researcher at Columbia University.\n\n\u201cThe argument in favor of enhanced oil recovery is often that if they weren\u2019t using this captured CO2, they\u2019d be using some other CO2, but I don\u2019t think you can call anything where you\u2019re getting more oil out of the ground to burn a climate solution.\u201d\n\nYet, so far, major oil companies have struggled to deploy CCS technology in any other capacity.\n\n\u201cWhen we talk about the failure of CCS, we generally talk about capturing, not storage, but when you look at capacity and how much has actually been sequestered, it\u2019s very little,\u201d Ho said.\n\nWhen CO2 is actually sequestered underground, there\u2019s no guarantee it stays there.\n\n\u201cCO2 has a way of moving through the air, of leaking through pipelines, and because we have no cradle-to-grave tracking, we have no way of actually knowing how much is leaking, how much is really being collected, how much is hitting the wellhead, and how much is really staying underground,\u201d Raffensperger said.\n\nThat\u2019s not just concerning from a climate perspective, but from a public health perspective as well.\n\nRaffensperger notes that the pipelines built to transport condensed carbon from oil fields to storage facilities, or to other oil fields for EOR, are surrounded by \u201ckill zones.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese are not your grandmother\u2019s pipelines,\u201d Raffensperger said.\n\n\u201cThey could be lethal.\n\nWe talk about the kill zone or a fatality zone around a CO2 pipeline.\n\nWe don\u2019t talk about that with oil and gas pipelines.\n\nThese are uniquely dangerous and underregulated.\u201d\n\nFollowing a 2020 CO2 leak and explosion in Satartia, Mississippi, that abruptly stopped cars on roadways, caused widespread dizziness and nausea, and sent several residents to the hospital, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration began looking into rules for CO2 pipelines.\n\nThey were set to finalize that rule this summer, pending review by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, but that deadline has been extended to fall 2024.\n\nThe lack of finalized safety regulations has not stopped the permitting of CO2 pipelines, though.\n\nThe Summit pipeline, a massive project that would carry carbon across five states, just got the go-ahead in June for the first step of its construction process in Iowa: seizing land through eminent domain to make way for the pipeline.\n\nAccording to current and former Exxon employees, the company\u2019s efforts to explore the \u201cS\u201d part of the CCS equation \u2014 storage, or sequestration \u2014 only began when it pulled together a team of technical experts to look for weaknesses in a 2018 US Geological Survey assessment that showed enormous potential for CCS.\n\n\u201cThey thought the USGS was overly optimistic [about the potential of CCS] and they wanted us to basically bring industry technical expertise in to tell them their projections were overblown,\u201d one Exxon staffer said.\n\nThe team brought together to study CCS was then tasked with running an experiment to see if it was even possible to permanently store captured carbon.\n\nWhen the study showed that it was indeed possible, current and former Exxon staffers told Vox and Drilled the company\u2019s executives were \u201csurprised.\u201d\n\nTo truly sell CCS as a climate solution, Exxon had to show that storage at scale was feasible.\n\nFormer employees told us that at the end of the last decade, executives came up with a prioritized list of the company\u2019s export and import terminals and refineries where it might be relatively easy to attach CCS.\n\nAs of this year, none of those projects have been built (though the company did publicly announce in late 2023 that it was working on a fuel-cell-powered carbon capture and hydrogen project at its Rotterdam refinery, one of the options on that list).\n\nWhile it hasn\u2019t managed to build commercial-scale carbon storage itself, Exxon did acquire enhanced oil recovery company Denbury in 2023, which brought 1,300 miles of CO2 pipelines and 15 onshore carbon storage sites under Exxon\u2019s control.\n\nAgain, this system is focused on enhanced oil recovery.\n\n\u201cCCS is a proven and safe technology that experts agree is pivotal to achieving net zero,\u201d an ExxonMobil spokesperson said in response to a request for comment for this story.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making progress in our Low Carbon Solutions business, with current plans to capture and permanently store more CO2 than any other company.\u201d\n\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has called the industry\u2019s plan to offset its emissions with carbon capture \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nBut the US government is all in on that fantasy now.\n\n\u201c[The carbon capture tax credit] 45Q is not based on net climate benefit or net CO2 reductions, it\u2019s based on gross CO2 capture,\u201d Blackburn, the environmental lawyer, said.\n\n\u201cWhy would you think making carbon a commodity would reduce CO2 emissions?\n\nIt\u2019s like the opposite of carbon tax, we\u2019re actually paying them to produce more of it.\u201d",

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? New York City is phasing out gas in new buildings. It\u2019s a milestone in the fight to clean up climate pollution. On Wednesday, New York became the largest city in the country to agree to phase out fossil fuels in all new building construction after the city council passed a bill that bans those buildings from hooking up to gas. The \u201cbreakthrough moment,\u201d according to council member Alicka Ampry-Samuel, spells the beginning of the end to gas-powered appliances used by default in construction. Carbon emissions from buildings are a major driver of climate change, and the main culprits are boilers and water heaters, and to a lesser degree, gas stoves. In the US, 13 percent of greenhouse gasses come from commercial and residential buildings powered by fossil fuels. New York City\u2019s buildings account for a much larger share of its emissions, more than transportation or any other category. The appliances that run on gas \u2014 stoves, furnaces, boilers, and water heaters \u2014 also come at another cost. When natural gas combusts indoors, it releases a mix of particulate matter, nitrogen and sulfur oxides, and volatile organic compounds \u2014 air pollutants that harm respiratory and cardiovascular health. With the new bill, New Yorkers can expect to see some changes by the end of 2023, when developers of new buildings under seven stories won\u2019t be allowed to put in gas-powered stoves, boilers, or water heaters. Instead, these buildings will use electricity, relying on a mix of technologies like heat pumps and induction stoves to replace gas and oil. Builders of larger structures like skyscrapers will have until 2027 before they have to scrap gas. And since the bill applies solely to the roughly 2,000 new buildings that go up in the city each year, it won\u2019t address the gas and other fossil fuels burned in the city\u2019s 1 million existing structures. (It\u2019s politically harder and more expensive to renovate buildings years later than it is to build them with electric power from the start.) Still, the ban is necessary for transitioning off of fossil fuels: Without it, the city\u2019s building sector would be a main source of climate pollution for decades to come. And the bill\u2019s advocates see it as a potential turning point in one of the most fraught national battles with the fossil fuel industry over the fate of the nation\u2019s 70 million gas-powered buildings. \u201cNew York City is stepping up on one crucial aspect of fighting the climate crisis,\u201d Pete Sikora, campaigns director for New York Communities for Change, a group that advocated for the bill. \u201cThis is the country\u2019s global city sending a signal to the nation and the world to get off of fossil fuels.\u201d There\u2019s a catch to electrification, however: You need an electric grid that runs on carbon-free power to completely eliminate the emissions from buildings. Right now, New York City gets most of its power from a local grid that gets 85 percent of its energy from fossil fuels. That grid is expected to rapidly transition to cleaner energy sources over the coming decade with the New York State law on the books charting a path to 70 percent clean electricity by 2030. The climate fight to electrify buildings is still in its early stages, but cities across the nation are starting to take a hard look at their electrification options. The gas stove is one of the biggest symbols in this fight, because it\u2019s one of the most visible reminders of how fossil fuels are integrated in many Americans\u2019 daily lives. So if gas-guzzling New York is taking steps to tackle gas hookups, it could be the beginning of an end to Americans\u2019 default way to cook and heat their homes. Climate activists have spent years ramping up to ambitious state-by-state campaigns to unhook the nation\u2019s buildings from fossil fuels. In 2019, Berkeley became the first to change its building codes that effectively required all new construction to rely on electricity. Since then, dozens of cities, mostly on the West Coast, have followed Berkeley\u2019s example. Ampry-Samuel and others were inspired by those efforts in coming up with New York City\u2019s gas-ban bill. A coalition of New York-based progressive groups, including WeAct for Environmental Justice and New York Communities Change, campaigned for the legislation, arguing that a transition off of fossil fuels is necessary for tackling climate change. On top of the climate benefits, they argued, the residents would benefit from cleaner indoor air. Every city that has attempted to electrify its new buildings has faced an aggressive counter-campaign to maintain the status quo. Gas utilities have worked to thwart these kinds of climate campaigns throughout the country. These utilities, worried about losing gas-reliant customers, have launched lawsuits and aggressive public relations campaigns in California to stop the march toward clean energy for buildings. One strategy I\u2019ve reported on is the industry effort to hire influencers to tout what they love about cooking with gas to generate public opposition to city efforts. In more conservative parts of the country, gas utilities have worked to pass state laws that prevent cities from even considering modifying building codes to promote electrification. In New York, lobby groups and oil companies, like American Petroleum Institute and ExxonMobil, ran Facebook ads targeting New Yorkers to \u201cvoice your support\u201d for gas stoves, E&E News reported. New York fended off some of the gas industry\u2019s attacks by extending compliance timelines and exempting commercial restaurants that still want to hook up to gas. The gas ban effort there also faced some unusual obstacles compared to nearby cities, like Philadelphia. According to the American Prospect\u2019s reporting, New York City\u2019s major utility companies were split over whether to support the bill, with the hybrid electric and gas utility ConEd supportive, and the more gas-reliant utility, National Grid, firmly opposed. But the biggest reason climate activists like Sikora suspect NYC\u2019s gas ban survived is the mounting research showing the effect building pollution has on public health, and disproportionately for people of color. A 2021 study by Harvard environmental health scientist Jonathan Buonocore, an environmental health research scientist at Harvard University, looked at how outdoor building pollution affects health outcomes, and found between 17,000 to 23,500 premature deaths nationwide from the latest data in 2017. RMI, a climate-focused think tank that analyzed his data, found 1,114 premature deaths linked specifically to NYC buildings. Another April study published in Science Advances charted how residential gas and commercial cooking are two major reasons Black, Hispanic, and Asian people are often exposed to higher levels of outdoor pollution than white people. \u201cWith all the progress we\u2019ve made in reducing emissions in electricity sector, buildings are now one of the leading sources of [outdoor] air pollution,\u201d Buonocore said. \u201cThey emit a whole variety of pollutants that lead to a lot of different of health impacts, including premature deaths, asthma, heart attack, stroke, and respiratory disease.\u201d Buonocore\u2019s work looked at how furnaces and boilers release particulate matter and nitrogen oxides outdoors into the atmosphere. His numbers, however, may be an underestimate of its toll, because it didn\u2019t look at the effects of gas stoves and gas ovens on indoor air quality. In most homes, cooking releases the same harmful pollutants directly inside the kitchen. Cutting out fossil fuels from new buildings solves a lot of these problems at once by \u201ctaking out a source of poor air quality that hurts people\u2019s health,\u201d said Sonal Jessel, director of policy at the climate justice group WE ACT for Environmental Justice. In other words, the best way for a city like New York to make a measurable impact on air quality is to get polluting appliances like the stove and boiler out of homes and businesses. New York City\u2019s move is significant for many reasons \u2014 with more than 8 million residents, it will be the largest test case in the country for adopting electric-powered technologies. It will have to overcome challenges that didn\u2019t apply to smaller cities in California that have passed electrification so far, like integrating technology for a colder climate and addressing the much higher demand for heat. New York is signaling its confidence it can overcome these challenges and become an example for other cities to do the same. To smooth over the transition, the bill will require a citywide study on using heat pumps in large buildings. Cities have a lot more work to do to move from tackling just new construction \u2014 both the building and power sector are overdue for more transformative change, and that will require bolder policies that tackle existing gas infrastructure and investments in the near future. For example, activists plan to push the New York state Assembly to adopt legislation that applies statewide that applies to all new construction and to enforce existing laws on the books that promote clean energy. Until quite recently, it was impossible to conceive that the largest, most gas-reliant American city would consider shutting off the growth in gas stoves and appliances. But now with one milestone behind them, climate activists are already eyeing the next target. \u201cNot having more gas hookups in new construction is, frankly, the lower-hanging fruit,\u201d said WE ACT\u2019s Jessel. \u201dThe question of how do we reduce emissions and how do we electrify existing buildings becomes a lot more complicated question.\u201d Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

In more conservative parts of the country, gas utilities have worked to pass state laws that prevent cities from even considering modifying building codes to promote electrification.\n\nIn New York, lobby groups and oil companies, like American Petroleum Institute and ExxonMobil, ran Facebook ads targeting New Yorkers to \u201cvoice your support\u201d for gas stoves, E&E News reported. New York fended off some of the gas industry\u2019s attacks by extending compliance timelines and exempting commercial restaurants that still want to hook up to gas.\n\nThe gas ban effort there also faced some unusual obstacles compared to nearby cities, like Philadelphia. According to the American Prospect\u2019s reporting, New York City\u2019s major utility companies were split over whether to support the bill, with the hybrid electric and gas utility ConEd supportive, and the more gas-reliant utility, National Grid, firmly opposed.\n\nBut the biggest reason climate activists like Sikora suspect NYC\u2019s gas ban survived is the mounting research showing the effect building pollution has on public health, and disproportionately for people of color. A 2021 study by Harvard environmental health scientist Jonathan Buonocore, an environmental health research scientist at Harvard University, looked at how outdoor building pollution affects health outcomes, and found between 17,000 to 23,500 premature deaths nationwide from the latest data in 2017.\n\nRMI, a climate-focused think tank that analyzed his data, found 1,114 premature deaths linked specifically to NYC buildings. Another April study published in Science Advances charted how residential gas and commercial cooking are two major reasons Black, Hispanic, and Asian people are often exposed to higher levels of outdoor pollution than white people.\n\n\u201cWith all the progress we\u2019ve made in reducing emissions in electricity sector, buildings are now one of the leading sources of [outdoor] air pollution,\u201d Buonocore said. \u201cThey emit a whole variety of pollutants that lead to a lot of different of health impacts, including premature deaths, asthma, heart attack, stroke, and respiratory disease.\u201d\n\nBuonocore\u2019s work looked at how furnaces and boilers release particulate matter and nitrogen oxides outdoors into the atmosphere. His numbers, however, may be an underestimate of its toll, because it didn\u2019t look at the effects of gas stoves and gas ovens on indoor air quality. In most homes, cooking releases the same harmful pollutants directly inside the kitchen.\n\nCutting out fossil fuels from new buildings solves a lot of these problems at once by \u201ctaking out a source of poor air quality that hurts people\u2019s health,\u201d said Sonal Jessel, director of policy at the climate justice group WE ACT for Environmental Justice.\n\nIn other words, the best way for a city like New York to make a measurable impact on air quality is to get polluting appliances like the stove and boiler out of homes and businesses.\n\nNew York City\u2019s move is significant for many reasons \u2014 with more than 8 million residents, it will be the largest test case in the country for adopting electric-powered technologies. It will have to overcome challenges that didn\u2019t apply to smaller cities in California that have passed electrification so far, like integrating technology for a colder climate and addressing the much higher demand for heat.\n\nNew York is signaling its confidence it can overcome these challenges and become an example for other cities to do the same. To smooth over the transition, the bill will require a citywide study on using heat pumps in large buildings.\n\nCities have a lot more work to do to move from tackling just new construction \u2014 both the building and power sector are overdue for more transformative change, and that will require bolder policies that tackle existing gas infrastructure and investments in the near future.\n\nFor example, activists plan to push the New York state Assembly to adopt legislation that applies statewide that applies to all new construction and to enforce existing laws on the books that promote clean energy.\n\nUntil quite recently, it was impossible to conceive that the largest, most gas-reliant American city would consider shutting off the growth in gas stoves and appliances. But now with one milestone behind them, climate activists are already eyeing the next target.\n\n\u201cNot having more gas hookups in new construction is, frankly, the lower-hanging fruit,\u201d said WE ACT\u2019s Jessel. \u201dThe question of how do we reduce emissions and how do we electrify existing buildings becomes a lot more complicated question.\u201d",

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Where companies and governments should place bets for the clean energy technologies of the future. The world now has many of the tools needed to keep climate change in check, the United Nations\u2019 climate research team reported last month. But humanity will still need to invent newer and better ones too. The question is what kinds of research governments and companies should invest in. In the final installment of its latest comprehensive assessment of climate science, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change examined tactics to mitigate climate change. But for the first time in the three-decade history of IPCC reports, the panel has devoted chapters to innovation and technology development. The report highlights how wind energy, solar power, and battery technologies that emit little to no greenhouse gases have made massive strides in performance and cost, making it more feasible than ever to shift the world away from burning fossil fuels at a faster pace than previously thought. These developments \u201chave increased the economic attractiveness of low-emission energy sector transitions through 2030,\u201d according to the report. However, fossil fuels still fulfill about 80 percent of the world\u2019s energy needs. Global greenhouse gas emissions appear to have been holding fairly steady for a decade now, but to keep the world from warming up more than 1.5 degrees Celsius or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit this century, those emissions have to fall by half from their current levels by 2030. So despite the advances, the pace of deployment of clean energy is still far too slow to keep more dangerous levels of warming in check. Getting on course will likely require even cheaper, more efficient, and higher-performing versions of the tools we have now. But it will also demand advances in fledgling clean technologies, like capturing carbon dioxide straight from the air. At the same time, money and political will to deal with climate change are in short supply around the world, given competing demands from the Covid-19 pandemic, inflation, and international conflicts. With limited time and money, it\u2019s critical to figure out what research will yield the most impactful innovations to counter climate change. It\u2019s difficult to predict which investments will lead to breakthroughs, but some researchers say there are ways to improve the odds. It requires thinking carefully about how potential innovations would scale and draw investment, but also demands policies to create the conditions for an even bigger clean energy revolution. To understand where to go next in clean energy innovation, it\u2019s helpful to first unpack some of the extraordinary progress already made. The price of solar electricity has dropped 89 percent since 2010, and silicon solar panels have increased in efficiency from 15 percent to more than 26 percent over the last 40 years. Onshore wind energy costs have fallen 70 percent in the last decade. Lithium-ion batteries have declined in price by 97 percent over the last three decades, while their energy density has nearly tripled in 10 years. Renewables have now become the cheapest source of new electricity production around the world. In half of the world, installing new wind or solar power is cheaper than running existing fossil fuel power plants. These developments were spurred by large government investments and energy policies, with some private sector backing. Photovoltaic panels, for example, benefited from early research in the United States, Japanese companies developing applications for solar, an aggressive feed-in tariff incentive in Germany, and massive production scale-up in China. The development process spanned decades, with the first solar panels invented in the 1950s and foundational research beginning in the 1970s. Governments also helped create demand for clean energy, by setting targets for deployment and subsidizing their purchase prices. But the technologies themselves have some common traits that helped them improve so quickly. For one, they readily scale up or down. A solar panel can be small enough to fit in a backpack. Larger panels can light up homes and thousands strung together can power a city. Wind farms can scale from several turbines to hundreds. Lithium-ion cells can power everything from phones to aircraft. That means tiny performance gains and price drops quickly add up. The smaller scales also create a lower cost barrier, so people are more willing to experiment with these technologies and find uses for them, hastening widespread adoption. And as these modular systems build up, they achieve economies of scale and costs begin to decline. Contrast this with large-scale energy technologies like nuclear power plants, which require billions of dollars upfront and take years to build. In the United States, nuclear is one of the few energy technologies for which the cost has gone up over time. The success of wind, solar, and batteries is \u201creally counterintuitive to what I was taught in graduate school,\u201d said Gregory Nemet, an IPCC author and professor of public affairs at the University of Wisconsin Madison. The conventional wisdom long held that a big problem like climate change demanded large-scale solutions. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned is that small-scale technologies are likely to turn out to be more scalable than large-scale technologies,\u201d Nemet said. So for clean energy, it pays to start small and go big rather than to start big and go bigger. IPCC authors often say that they don\u2019t prescribe any particular policies or recommend a specific course of action on climate change; they just pool and evaluate the strength of the body of research. Still, the latest report finds that some energy strategies are faster and more cost-effective than others. Among the various clean energy technologies available now, wind and solar will remain the cheapest and fastest ways to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector by 2030, according to the IPCC. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to focus on anything and not say \u2018all of the above,\u2019 those are the technologies that matter,\u201d Nemet said. \u201cWe\u2019re missing an opportunity if we don\u2019t take advantage of what we\u2019ve got now.\u201d The technology itself still has room for improvement, but what\u2019s needed is not so much a better wind turbine or solar panel as much as broader policy changes that encourage more widespread adoption. For residential solar power, upward of 70 percent of the price tag is due to \u201csoft costs\u201d \u2014 things like permitting, inspections, installation, and financing rather than the cost of the hardware itself. Solar could still get much cheaper, with costs falling another 50 percent by 2050 according to some estimates, but it will require cutting through this red tape. While often not thought of as technology, energy efficiency is another cheap, scalable, ready-to-deploy method to curb greenhouse gas emissions. The IPCC report noted that the 18 countries that have sustained emissions cuts for more than a decade did so by doing more with less. \u201cReductions were linked to energy supply decarbonisation, energy efficiency gains, and energy demand reduction, which resulted from both policies and changes in economic structure,\u201d according to the report. For example, simply improving insulation on buildings could take a massive bite out of greenhouse gas emissions by reducing energy demand. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, enhancing residential energy efficiency is the single largest carbon dioxide-reducing intervention in the US. As for clean energy technologies that are still in their infancy, there are several criteria to consider, said Erin Baker, faculty director of the Energy Transition Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The key formula for evaluating an investment is the chance of success multiplied by the potential benefit. Clean energy systems that are scalable and have low entry costs are, again, those best poised to take off. But it\u2019s also important to cast as wide a net as possible rather than spraying a firehose of money at a particular technology until it works. \u201cTo the degree that you can do things agnostically, it\u2019s always good, because we don\u2019t know where the next breakthrough is going to come from,\u201d Baker said. There are some specific clean energy needs, though, that need further backing right away, namely tools for storing, dispatching, and maintaining the quality of electricity on the power grid. \u201cThe biggest category is these things that make the grid reliable,\u201d Baker said. \u201cSome of that investment is technologies but some of that investment is more processes, business models, and regulations.\u201d One key area where the world needs to invest more is in carbon dioxide removal (CDR), where carbon dioxide is drawn directly out of the atmosphere. Though there are fears it may create a moral hazard, in sectors like aviation, shipping, and heavy industry, emissions may never drop to zero. So meeting international climate targets would require a way to withdraw those emissions. \u201cThe deployment of CDR to counterbalance hard-to-abate residual emissions is unavoidable if net zero CO2 or [greenhouse gas] emissions are to be achieved,\u201d according to the IPCC report. There are several companies working on CDR technologies now, but it remains expensive and energy-intensive. A group of tech companies including the parent companies of Google and Facebook recently decided to tackle CDR in another way, by creating demand for it. The companies launched Frontier, which they describe as an \u201cadvance market commitment,\u201d pooling almost $1 billion to guarantee purchases of permanent carbon dioxide removal. These kinds of commitments could become another way to accelerate the development of clean technologies, but conventional incentives like subsidies and tax breaks remain critical too. And when it comes to climate change, one of the most important policies is to put a price on carbon dioxide emissions. \u201cBased on a detailed sectoral assessment of mitigation options, it is estimated that mitigation options costing [$100 per ton of CO2] or less could reduce global GHG emissions by at least half of the 2019 level by 2030,\u201d according to the IPCC report. Climate change, however, imposes time constraints. Keeping global average temperatures from rising beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius would require not just halving current emissions in the next eight years, but achieving net zero emissions by 2050 and producing negative emissions thereafter \u2014 that is, taking more carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than the world puts in. So a research, development, and deployment strategy has to have multiple horizons: ramping up wind and solar today while investing in technologies like nuclear, hydrogen, and CDR over the long term, and even making some longshot bets on nuclear fusion energy and investigating geoengineering. And while better technology is necessary for mitigating climate change, it\u2019s not sufficient. The biggest breakthrough won\u2019t mean much if no one will buy it or use it. Clean energy innovations also won\u2019t solve the fundamental injustice of climate change: that the people who contributed least to the problem stand to suffer the most. Meanwhile, those who produced the most greenhouse gases have the wealth to adapt to the unavoidable warming that\u2019s in store. So keeping the most dangerous climate change scenarios off the table demands more than better batteries, solar panels, and business models. It requires tackling the inequities and bad habits that created the situation in the first place. That, too, will require innovation in how the world distributes the costs of climate change and the benefits of a transition toward cleaner energy.

        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we\u2019re committed to clarity, truth, and depth \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard. That kind of journalism isn\u2019t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Automakers, industries, and governments are betting on hydrogen again. Will it work this time? This story is part of Recode by Vox\u2019s Tech Support series, which explores solutions for our warming world. Between the battery electrics, plug-in hybrids, and radar-festooned self-driving cars on the streets here in San Francisco, the slick red Toyota Mirai doesn\u2019t turn many heads.  That\u2019s despite it being one of the most technologically advanced cars in the world and one of the rarest. Since it went on sale in 2015, Toyota has sold only about 10,000 of the sedans in the United States (out of a total of approximately 290 million registered cars in the country). Yet it easily blends in with traffic. The Mirai takes styling cues from Toyota\u2019s more mundane offerings, like the Corolla and the Camry. Inside the cabin, it has the fit, finish, noise isolation, and heated seats of a luxury car. Behind the wheel, the Mirai has the torquey pull of an electric motor, launching up steep streets and feeling far more nimble than its 4,200-pound weight would suggest. It\u2019s only when you pop the hood that you can see what sets the Mirai apart: a tidy silver block with the Toyota logo and the words \u201cfuel cell.\u201d And behind the back seat is a tank filled with hydrogen gas \u2014 the most abundant element in the universe, and potentially a clean fuel whose main \u201cwaste\u201d product is water. The world is desperate for more ways to curb carbon dioxide pollution. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak and decline by 2025 to keep warming this century below 1.5 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s less than 1,000 days away, yet global emissions are still rising. And transportation alone accounts for 20 percent of global emissions. That\u2019s where hydrogen energy comes in \u2014 companies like Toyota think it could be the future, or at least a part of it (\u201cMirai\u201d means \u201cfuture\u201d in Japanese). While other clean energy technologies like battery-powered vehicles have gained momentum, they aren\u2019t rolling out fast enough or cheap enough. Hydrogen could help get the world to its climate goals faster by powering not only cars like the Mirai, but also ships and aircraft in the near future.  Hydrogen has potential uses beyond vehicles, too: It can make synthetic fuels and store power for the electricity grid; it can also clean up industries that are notoriously hard to decarbonize, like steel manufacturing.  Hydrogen fuel cells have dropped 60 percent in price since 2006, while their durability increased fourfold These promising use cases have driven interest and investment in hydrogen as fuel in the past, which is why you may have heard about it before: Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama touted hydrogen and invested government money into researching and developing the fuel. But the hype faded each time as high production costs, practical challenges, and a limited infrastructure for hydrogen-powered vehicles got in the way. For hydrogen-powered cars to truly take off anywhere, they\u2019ll first require a vast network of fueling stations, pipelines, and producers \u2014 essentially a hydrogen economy \u2014 to compete and win against fossil fuels. The US has never gotten close to building something like this. But for now, the momentum behind hydrogen energy is once again building as its demand grows and the technology behind it improves. According to 2018 data, hydrogen fuel cells have dropped 60 percent in price since 2006, while their durability increased fourfold.  In 2021, Toyota sold more than 2,600 Mirais in the US, a record. Other hydrogen cars have entered the market too, including the Hyundai Nexo and the Honda Clarity. As of March 1, more than 12,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been sold or leased in the US. Meanwhile, Delta Airlines and Airbus in March signed an agreement to develop hydrogen-powered aircraft. New hydrogen production plants are in the works in the US. In February, President Joe Biden announced close to $10 billion in funding to boost hydrogen production, infrastructure, and research.  Overseas, China announced plans to produce as much as 200,000 tons of carbon-free hydrogen per year to help run a fleet of 50,000 fuel cell-powered vehicles by 2025. The United Kingdom is aiming to double its hydrogen production. Globally, hydrogen production and transportation has received more than $80 billion in investment.  In a moment when the urgency of the climate crisis cannot be understated, hydrogen is getting another chance to help clean up the planet.  Like many clean technologies, hydrogen has tricky nuances, especially when it comes to its \u201cclean\u201d credentials. For one thing, many researchers and engineers would argue that hydrogen is not an energy source; it\u2019s an energy carrier. It\u2019s analogous to a battery, which can hold energy but still needs another way to charge it. While hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it\u2019s usually attached to other molecules here on earth. To use it as a fuel, you must first form hydrogen gas, H2 (two hydrogen atoms stuck together), which requires a source of hydrogen atoms and an energy input. Hydrogen gas is more of a middleman between an energy source and its use in a car, boat, or power plant. It often takes more energy to make H2 than you get from using it, similar to how a battery requires a bit more energy to charge up than it releases in use. According to the International Energy Agency, hydrogen production accounts for 830 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, equivalent to the footprint of the United Kingdom and Indonesia combined. Hydrogen itself is an odorless, colorless gas no matter how it\u2019s produced, but the various ways to make hydrogen are typically categorized by color. The main types of hydrogen to pay attention to are gray hydrogen and green hydrogen.  In the US, 95 percent of hydrogen is gray hydrogen, which is made with steam-methane reforming. The process uses steam as hot as 1,800\u00b0F to react with methane under high pressure, yielding hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. It\u2019s cheap, but it has a carbon footprint: Every kilogram of gray hydrogen results in about 10 kilograms of carbon dioxide. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, draws on renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, a process called electrolysis. It produces zero carbon dioxide emissions, but it\u2019s upward of twice as expensive to produce as gray hydrogen and it accounts for less than 1 percent of the world\u2019s hydrogen production. There are other colors too \u2014 blue, pink, turquoise, black, white \u2014 distinguished by where the hydrogen comes from and how much carbon dioxide the process emits.  For hydrogen to truly help with confronting the climate crisis, the world must figure out how to produce cleaner hydrogen at larger scales and lower cost. Last year, the US Department of Energy launched a research program called Hydrogen Shot with the aim of making clean hydrogen for $1 per kilogram in 10 years.  As for using hydrogen, there are two main ways to put it to work. One is to burn it like any other gas in engines, similar to conventional internal combustion engines that run on fuels like gasoline and diesel. Unlike those fuels, hydrogen doesn\u2019t release harmful emissions when you burn it. The other way is to send hydrogen through a fuel cell. This device separates hydrogen into protons and electrons, with the electrons generating a current to power a motor and the protons reacting with oxygen in the air to make water. Fuel cells actually have a long history dating back to the 1800s. But only in recent years did their cost, efficiency, and durability reach the levels needed for more widespread use.  With both fuel cells and combustion, hydrogen\u2019s uses can scale from small unmanned aircraft to storing and dispatching electricity on the power grid. Its potential to reduce emissions is very real \u2014 but a lot has to fall into place first. The ins and outs of owning a hydrogen-powered car illustrate the fuel\u2019s promise, but also the immense hurdles it will have to overcome in order to take a bite of greenhouse gas emissions and anchor a new clean industry. There are big advantages to a hydrogen car: It can refuel in five minutes, compared to sometimes hours of charging needed for a battery electric car. You also don\u2019t need access to a car charger, but rather a pump similar to one used for gasoline, often at the same station. That\u2019s one reason that motivated Darren Higuchi of Alameda, California, to buy a Mirai last year. Since he lives in a multifamily building, Higuchi said he doesn\u2019t have the option to install a car charger at home. \u201cI see people lining up for [the Tesla supercharger nearby], parking and waiting, and that\u2019s more maintenance than I want to deal with,\u201d he said.  Hydrogen fuel cell cars have the same smooth and quiet electric drivetrain as battery-powered cars, which also brings lower maintenance costs compared to gasoline and diesel engines. Drivers can use carpool lanes in most states as well. There are financial incentives, too: Mirais come with a factory rebate, a federal tax credit, and California\u2019s clean vehicle credit, which drops its out-the-door price from around $60,000 to $35,000. Toyota also gives owners $15,000 worth of hydrogen fuel for free. Out of pocket, filling up a Mirai costs between $70 to $100 and provides close to 400 miles of range.  But for all the work Toyota put into making an appealing hydrogen car, its biggest drawbacks are beyond the company\u2019s control. Most of the hydrogen fueling stations in the US are in California. The state has 52 hydrogen stations, including two in San Francisco, and 121 in development, according to the California Fuel Cell Partnership. But the stations are mainly concentrated around the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. There\u2019s just one hydrogen station on the 340-mile I-5 stretch between the Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles. On a road trip to San Diego in his Mirai, Higuchi said he gamed out the locations of hydrogen fueling stations, how fast he wanted to drive, and how much we wanted to test the range of the car. \u201cI mapped out where I would go and paired that to anxiety levels,\u201d he said.  Right now, hydrogen infrastructure is caught in a rut. With so few hydrogen cars on the road, it\u2019s hard to convince companies to invest the approximately $2 million it typically costs to build a single hydrogen station. But with so few stations, it\u2019s tough to sell drivers on a hydrogen car. The small scales of hydrogen production have also left it vulnerable to shocks. Right now, most hydrogen produced in the US is used for chemical manufacturing. \u201cWe\u2019ve been living off of surplus hydrogen that is being taken from other industries and being used for transportation,\u201d said Russ Mobley, a sales manager at San Francisco Toyota and a Mirai owner. In 2019, a hydrogen explosion at a Santa Clara plant caused shortages across the Bay Area for nearly six months. During that time, Toyota gave Mirai drivers free rental cars to get around. \u201cWe didn\u2019t drive our hydrogen cars. They became paperweights at that point in our driveways,\u201d Mobley said.  Compare these ordeals to battery-electric cars, which can charge up just about anywhere there is a power outlet or at one of the fast-charging stations cropping up quickly around the country. So while hydrogen cars themselves may be excellent, the weak infrastructure to support them continues to hold them back. The infrastructure hydrogen needs poses its own technical challenges. It requires high-pressure pumps, fittings, and storage containers, many of which are expensive boutique products. The Covid-19 pandemic then threw up another roadblock, disrupting the supply chains for hydrogen construction projects.  \u201cThese pumps are all handmade,\u201d Mobley said. \u201cWhen the entire world shuts down and nobody\u2019s in there manufacturing the bolts and nuts and seals, pretty much we saw the construction halt.\u201d The hope now is that with larger players like trucking and delivery companies investing in their own hydrogen vehicles, they will drive economies of scale for everyone. With larger vehicles, planned routes, and centralized fueling, these industrial uses might be even a better use for hydrogen than passenger cars. \u201cAs we rotate into more of the trucking industry getting into using hydrogen technology, the infrastructure is going to be beefed up considerably,\u201d Mobley said. Daimler Truck, for example, is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles, accounting for about 58 percent of the market for large highway trucks. The company has already received approval for a hydrogen-powered truck in Germany and expects to begin delivering hydrogen trucks to customers in 2027. It\u2019s also a shareholder in H2 Mobility Deutschland, a hydrogen fueling station operator that recently raised 110 million euros from investors. In addition, Daimler has teamed up with Volvo to build a fuel cell factory scheduled to begin operation in 2025.  Meanwhile, delivery firms like DHL, Royal Mail, FedEx, UPS, and Swiss Post are currently testing out hydrogen vehicles on their routes.  As for industrial uses, Swedish steel manufacturer Hybrit last year began delivering steel made with a hydrogen-based process that emits zero greenhouse gasses. Steel production accounts for around 7 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, decarbonizing the industry with hydrogen would require $278 billion in investment through 2050.  On the production side, green hydrogen also needs to scale up to drive down costs. The question is whether countries and companies can brute force an entire clean hydrogen industry into existence fast enough to meet climate targets.  For its part, California thinks hydrogen is worthwhile. Last October, the California Air Resources Board put out a report on hydrogen infrastructure in the state. Looking at various scenarios, the report concluded California could run a self-sufficient hydrogen network servicing 1.8 million fuel cell cars by 2035 with about $300 million in state funding. Toyota, meanwhile, is hedging. The company is investing $17.6 billion to produce a line of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. Daimler is also pursuing battery-electric trucks alongside hydrogen. Batteries have experienced a stunning 97 percent drop in costs over the last 30 years, and battery-powered vehicles are already gaining ground around the world.  Some analysts are skeptical that hydrogen could ever catch up, at least for cars and trucks. \u201c[T]he window of opportunity to establish a relevant market share for hydrogen cars is as good as closed,\u201d argued Patrick Pl\u00f6tz, coordinator of the energy economy business unit at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in Germany, in Nature Electronics earlier this year. For trucks, manufacturers and governments need to make stronger and faster efforts to deploy them if they have any hope of hitting highways. \u201cIf truck manufacturers do not start the mass production of fuel cell trucks soon to reduce costs, such vehicles will never succeed in low-carbon road transport,\u201d he wrote. But Pl\u00f6tz said hydrogen still could play important roles in decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and industry.  So even though some of the largest car and truck manufacturers are trying to force a hydrogen economy into existence, it could be yet another false start. After decades of hype and continued growing pains, it\u2019s tough to get excited about hydrogen again. But the potential for hydrogen as a pillar of clean energy is impossible to ignore, and with more investment than ever and the urgent need for tools to slow climate change, this might be the moment it finally ignites.

million it typically costs to build a single hydrogen station. \nBut with so few stations, it\u2019s tough to sell drivers on a hydrogen car. \nThe small scales of hydrogen production have also left it vulnerable to shocks. \nRight now, most hydrogen produced in the US is used for chemical manufacturing. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve been living off of surplus hydrogen that is being taken from other industries and being used for transportation,\u201d said Russ Mobley, a sales manager at San Francisco Toyota and a Mirai owner. \nIn 2019, a hydrogen explosion at a Santa Clara plant caused shortages across the Bay Area for nearly six months. \nDuring that time, Toyota gave Mirai drivers free rental cars to get around. \n\u201cWe didn\u2019t drive our hydrogen cars. They became paperweights at that point in our driveways,\u201d Mobley said. \nCompare these ordeals to battery-electric cars, which can charge up just about anywhere there is a power outlet or at one of the fast-charging stations cropping up quickly around the country. \nSo while hydrogen cars themselves may be excellent, the weak infrastructure to support them continues to hold them back. \nThe infrastructure hydrogen needs poses its own technical challenges. \nIt requires high-pressure pumps, fittings, and storage containers, many of which are expensive boutique products. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic then threw up another roadblock, disrupting the supply chains for hydrogen construction projects. \n\u201cThese pumps are all handmade,\u201d Mobley said. \n\u201cWhen the entire world shuts down and nobody\u2019s in there manufacturing the bolts and nuts and seals, pretty much we saw the construction halt.\u201d \nThe hope now is that with larger players like trucking and delivery companies investing in their own hydrogen vehicles, they will drive economies of scale for everyone. \nWith larger vehicles, planned routes, and centralized fueling, these industrial uses might be even a better use for hydrogen than passenger cars. \n\u201cAs we rotate into more of the trucking industry getting into using hydrogen technology, the infrastructure is going to be beefed up considerably,\u201d Mobley said. \nDaimler Truck, for example, is one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles, accounting for about 58 percent of the market for large highway trucks. \nThe company has already received approval for a hydrogen-powered truck in Germany and expects to begin delivering hydrogen trucks to customers in 2027. \nIt\u2019s also a shareholder in H2 Mobility Deutschland, a hydrogen fueling station operator that recently raised 110 million euros from investors. \nIn addition, Daimler has teamed up with Volvo to build a fuel cell factory scheduled to begin operation in 2025. \nMeanwhile, delivery firms like DHL, Royal Mail, FedEx, UPS, and Swiss Post are currently testing out hydrogen vehicles on their routes. \nAs for industrial uses, Swedish steel manufacturer Hybrit last year began delivering steel made with a hydrogen-based process that emits zero greenhouse gasses. \nSteel production accounts for around 7 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. \nAccording to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, decarbonizing the industry with hydrogen would require $278 billion in investment through 2050. \nOn the production side, green hydrogen also needs to scale up to drive down costs. \nThe question is whether countries and companies can brute force an entire clean hydrogen industry into existence fast enough to meet climate targets. \nFor its part, California thinks hydrogen is worthwhile. \nLast October, the California Air Resources Board put out a report on hydrogen infrastructure in the state. \nLooking at various scenarios, the report concluded California could run a self-sufficient hydrogen network servicing 1.8 million fuel cell cars by 2035 with about $300 million in state funding. \nToyota, meanwhile, is hedging. \nThe company is investing $17.6 billion to produce a line of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. \nDaimler is also pursuing battery-electric trucks alongside hydrogen. \nBatteries have experienced a stunning 97 percent drop in costs over the last 30 years, and battery-powered vehicles are already gaining ground around the world. \nSome analysts are skeptical that hydrogen could ever catch up, at least for cars and trucks. \n\u201c[T]he window of opportunity to establish a relevant market share for hydrogen cars is as good as closed,\u201d argued Patrick Pl\u00f6tz, coordinator of the energy economy business unit at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in Germany, in Nature Electronics earlier this year. \nFor trucks, manufacturers and governments need to make stronger and faster efforts to deploy them if they have any hope of hitting highways. \n\u201cIf truck manufacturers do not start the mass production of fuel cell trucks soon to reduce costs, such vehicles will never succeed in low-carbon road transport,\u201d he wrote. \nBut Pl\u00f6tz said hydrogen still could play important roles in decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and industry. \nSo even though some of the largest car and truck manufacturers are trying to force a hydrogen economy into existence, it could be yet another false start. \nAfter decades of hype and continued growing pains, it\u2019s tough to get excited about hydrogen again. \nBut the potential for hydrogen as a pillar of clean energy is impossible to ignore, and with more investment than ever and the urgent need for tools to slow climate change, this might be the moment it finally ignites.",

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Buildings waste a lot of energy. One low-tech solution could fix that. This story is part of Recode by Vox\u2019s Tech Support series, which explores solutions for our warming world. The world is buzzing with climate change solutions these days: Maybe we can plant a trillion trees to save ecosystems and scrub greenhouse gases out of the air in one fell swoop! Or store energy in giant cement blocks that can act like batteries made of potential energy! Or use our electric vehicles as batteries for our homes and businesses! These sound like promising ideas, but some are only in the early stages. Many of them will take years to come to fruition, if they ever do at all, and there\u2019s a fair amount of disagreement about how effective some of them would be. Which is why it\u2019s time we start thinking more about a low-tech, time-tested, and far less sexy solution: insulation. Buildings are responsible for 40 percent of energy consumption in the United States, more than half of which goes toward heating and cooling. With the majority of the country\u2019s energy still coming from fossil fuels, reducing that energy consumption would have significant climate impacts. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, residential energy efficiency could be the largest source of reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and a 2016 study showed that increasing insulation in all the single-family homes in the country would lead to annual reductions of 80 million tons of carbon dioxide from power plants. That amounts to about 4.7 percent of the annual carbon emissions from American power plants, or the equivalent of taking 15.6 million gas-powered cars off the road. The reduced energy needs would make it easier for utility companies to transition to clean energy, and as the latest alarming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report makes clear, every bit counts.  \u201cEfficiency is one of those things that people don\u2019t think about a lot, but actually it\u2019s huge,\u201d said Victor Olgyay, principal architect in the carbon-free buildings program at RMI, a think tank that studies sustainability. Olgyay, as his title might suggest, happens to be the kind of person who does spend a lot of time thinking about efficiency, and he has firsthand experience with the difference a little insulation can make. After he and his wife Kristy bought a 1950s-era ranch-style home in central Boulder, Colorado, in 2004, they found that the house, being as old as it was, wasn\u2019t very good at staying warm in the Colorado winter. Rather than crank the heat, Olgyay reached for the fluffy stuff.  Insulation works on a simple concept: It keeps the outside out and the inside in. \u201cThe primary purpose of a building is to provide shelter,\u201d Christoph Reinhart, director of the building technology program at MIT, told Recode. \u201cBeing thermally separated, reducing conduction, is always good.\u201d A well-insulated building isn\u2019t just good at staying warm; insulation also keeps indoor spaces cool for longer, without using any extra energy. Take Olgyay\u2019s own house. After spending a few weekends stuffing fluffy insulation into the attic, filling wall cavities and gaps between floor joists, wrapping air ducts and water pipes in the crawlspace underneath the house, and sealing gaps around windows and doors, the ranch home became fairly airtight. That means that in the winter, heat from the furnace will stay inside the house \u2014 which means the furnace will run less often. In the summer, Olgyay\u2019s family can open their windows at night to let in the cool air and shut them during the day to keep out the heat. With the addition of a small rooftop solar panel system installed in 2007 that could provide most of the power they needed, their only major reliance on utility companies \u2014 and on fossil fuels \u2014 came through the couple hundred dollars they spent on their gas bill each year. A well-insulated building isn\u2019t just good at staying warm; insulation also keeps indoor spaces cool for longer, without using any extra energy Few buildings in the country are as well-insulated as Olgyay\u2019s home. As Vox\u2019s Umair Irfan wrote in a 2019 story detailing the poor state of insulation around the country, commercial buildings waste 30 percent of the energy they consume, while 90 percent of American homes are under-insulated. That can have serious consequences beyond the climate impacts, directly affecting the people living in these homes: A 20-year study published in 2021 found that global heat-related deaths are on the rise, with more than 5 million deaths each year attributed to extreme heat or cold.  Improving insulation, Olgyay says, can increase the \u201cpassive survivability\u201d of a building, or the length of time buildings stay at a comfortable temperature without power. That\u2019s particularly important as extreme weather is on the rise across the country, bringing power blackouts in its wake. The majority of deaths in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Ida, which hit the city in the summer of 2021, were attributed to residents being trapped inside their homes without air conditioning; 161 deaths in the wake of a winter storm that caused mass blackouts in Texas in early 2021 were attributed to exposure to the cold.  So the solution sounds simple, right? Just add some insulation into our walls, make buildings more comfortable and more climate-friendly, and call it a day?  Sadly, it\u2019s not quite that easy. To begin with, most existing building owners \u2014 whether of single-family homes, apartment buildings, or commercial spaces \u2014 tend to think of the structure of their buildings as mostly fixed, and the prospect of padding attics with insulation or drilling holes into walls to blow insulation into the gaps between studs is daunting and expensive. Homeowners, Reinhart said, are more likely to focus on energy-efficient improvements like LED bulbs or new refrigerators that can be easily swapped in and out without major renovation work.  \u201cIt\u2019s really disruptive to insulate in most cases,\u201d Reinhart told Recode. Part of the problem is that if a house already has some insulation, even if it isn\u2019t very efficient, removing it to make space for new insulation is very difficult \u2014 something Reinhart is hoping to find a solution for that wouldn\u2019t require extensive renovation work.  The expense also means making improvements to insulation is only an option for people with enough disposable income to cover the cost without government assistance. The US Department of Energy does have a Weatherization Assistance Program for low-income households that\u2019s meant to help with the cost, though the funds are administered at a state and local level and require homeowners to jump through bureaucratic hoops to receive assistance. And renters \u2014 who make up about 36 percent of the nation\u2019s households \u2014 are left at the mercy of their landlords. \u201cThe rental situation has what we call a split incentive,\u201d Olgyay said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got people living there who are usually paying the utility bills, and then you\u2019ve got a landlord who doesn\u2019t see that and so has no incentive to improve the efficiency of the place.\u201d  Commercial buildings waste 30 percent of the energy they consume, while 90 percent of American homes are under-insulated Some groups, like the Institution for Market Transformation, a nonprofit that advocates for the role of buildings as environmental and societal solutions, have proposed the idea of \u201cgreen leases\u201d that would incentivize landlords to increase the sustainability of their buildings. The idea, essentially, is that landlords will spend money to make their buildings more energy-efficient, and the cost savings the tenants might see from reduced utility bills would instead go to the landlord to pay for those upgrades. There\u2019s little agreement on how those leases should work, however; unless landlords across the country were to suddenly become exceedingly concerned about climate change of their own free will (and tenants, in turn, were to agree to higher rents in exchange for lower utility bills), green leases would probably need some sort of governmental push to become a reality.  It\u2019s also important to think about how we should insulate our buildings as they are constructed. The amount of insulation put into a building is usually decided by a timeline of how quickly the insulation\u2019s benefits will recoup the upfront cost, Olgyay said, and building codes tend to focus on quicker cost recoupment rather than high energy efficiency. \u201cWhat that doesn\u2019t really account for is the ability to have deeper cost savings,\u201d Olgyay told Recode. If new buildings were constructed with more effective insulation, they would need to use air conditioners and heaters less often \u2014 saving more energy and money in the long run.  Builders also need to start thinking about how their buildings impact the environment simply by being constructed, Olgyay said. According to a recent report Olgyay co-authored, at least one-quarter of the carbon emissions of buildings come from the construction process, part of which comes from the nature of the materials used in constructing those buildings. Those materials essentially lock in a building\u2019s carbon footprint from the very beginning \u2014 a concept known as embodied carbon. Insulation is a good example of this: Most insulation used nowadays is made from plastic, making it high in embodied carbon. Switching to insulation with low or no embodied carbon, such as insulation made from organic materials like cotton or cellulose, would reduce a building\u2019s embodied carbon by 16 percent without any increase in costs.  All of these fixes would require us to change how we think about insulation, or to start thinking about it in the first place. But it\u2019s time, Olgyay and Reinhart told Recode. Improving building insulation \u2014 and pairing those improvements with other technologies that would reduce the use of fossil fuels, like rooftop solar panels and electric heat pumps \u2014 is key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Better buildings will need to be more efficient down to their very bones. \u201cIt\u2019s just an integral part, the insulation,\u201d Reinhart said. \u201cIf you have this vision of a great future for society, you need the insulation too.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? How closing tax havens can fund climate policy. Governments have long tried pricing carbon to induce companies to make the kind of serious emissions reductions actually needed to address the climate emergency. They\u2019ve done this by imposing a carbon tax, an additional fee for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted, or through \u201ccap and trade\u201d schemes, which give companies limited allowances for how much CO2 they can emit and then allow them to buy and sell those allowances to offer more flexibility. The idea is that pricing carbon will decrease CO2 emissions over time by making polluting so expensive that companies have the incentive to find cleaner ways to operate. However, pricing carbon hasn\u2019t been very effective at reducing emissions by the dramatic levels needed to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change. And taxing carbon has proven unpopular in many places in the world because it usually means people have to pay more for everyday costs.  But that hasn\u2019t stopped governments from trying it. Jessica F. Green, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto whose work focuses on global environmental politics, argues that\u2019s partly because focusing on the technicalities of carbon pricing is a good way to avoid addressing the harder problem of actually ending fossil fuel use. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working on how to measure carbon for 30 years and we\u2019re still debating about or refining what it is because it\u2019s easier to do that than it is to actually decarbonize,\u201d Green told me.  Green argues in a new paper that climate change is not a \u201cmarket failure\u201d to be fixed through mechanisms like carbon pricing. Rather, she says, it\u2019s \u201ca problem of societal transformation\u201d that requires \u201cstrong state intervention to reorganize the economy.\u201d Green says countries should aggressively pursue taxation (one of the basic functions of the state), but of the rich \u2014 and use the money generated to fund climate policy. \u201cThe climate crisis has not been caused equally by everyone. Rich people cause climate problems,\u201d Green said. I called Green to find out more about why carbon pricing, and especially carbon taxes, haven\u2019t worked so well and why she thinks taxing the rich might. Our conversation, edited for clarity and length, is below. What would you say is the main idea of your paper? If something doesn\u2019t work very well, we should try something else. That\u2019s the bottom line. And what we know from the empirical record on carbon pricing is that it doesn\u2019t do a whole lot to actually reduce carbon emissions, and even less to facilitate decarbonization. When countries do see emissions reductions, they are often from things like efficiency improvements or switching away from coal to fossil gas. These things aren\u2019t bad, but they\u2019re not going to get us to net-zero emissions by 2050, which is what countries have agreed to do under the Paris Agreement. So are you saying we should just forget about carbon pricing altogether? Do you think there\u2019s an aspect of the policy that\u2019s worth saving? It\u2019s a really tricky problem, but I think, in an ideal world, we\u2019d just get rid of it. Because today, for example, there\u2019s an article in the Washington Post which explains how the American Petroleum Institute is strongly considering backing a carbon tax \u2014 which is a signal that this policy has been completely co-opted by the people that it\u2019s supposed to be regulating. When you have big, powerful oil and gas firms that are also backing a carbon tax, that should be a signal that the ideal conditions under which such a policy could function will likely not materialize, because these interests are very powerful, and they\u2019re so entrenched in the governments that are trying to regulate them. What about the European Union\u2019s experience with carbon pricing? I feel like the EU has been effective in implementing a carbon tax, right? The EU story is positive, but it has taken a long time. The EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System was first created in 2005 and for the first three years, the program was a wash in terms of emissions reductions. (Which is understandable because they were getting the policy off the ground). But throughout the last I would say 11 or 12 years, they\u2019ve made a lot of improvements on the functioning of the market. Carbon prices were very volatile, but they\u2019re now more stable \u2014 they\u2019ve actually increased. They have really dealt with their supply problem \u2014 because they had a huge oversupply, which was causing a glut in the market and driving down prices. They created a stability mechanism, a market stability reserve, which works like a central bank, controlling the supply. Sounds pretty good to me! What hasn\u2019t the EU gotten right? I looked at the studies of the EU\u2019s actual performance: If you try to isolate how much emissions fell because of the EU\u2019s Emissions Trading System, estimates have only placed it at around one to three percent per year, which is not a lot. Plus, the EU is a set of countries that are very wealthy and have a significant regulatory capacity. I mean, they are literally armies of bureaucrats who are working on this issue. And they have a lot of political will. So in many ways, the EU has been the most likely case for success \u2014 and it\u2019s still not that great. So it\u2019s a success story in a way, but it\u2019s still not effective enough. I\u2019d like to talk more about what you\u2019re proposing countries do instead of, or at least in addition to, carbon pricing. The argument involves getting countries to change their tax policies to eliminate corporate tax havens, is that right? The basic idea is that each country makes its own laws about how much they tax individuals and corporations, and the rules around transparency. A handful of countries, including the UK through [overseas territories] like the British Virgin Islands, have set their corporate tax rates very low or nothing at all. So if you are a multinational corporation like Google or Amazon, or an oil and gas company, you can say, \u201cOkay, well, then I\u2019m going to have some of my company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. And if I report my profits, they will only get taxed at 3 percent, as opposed to 15 percent back in the UK. So that\u2019s just literally money in the bank. And as long as I don\u2019t repatriate that money to the UK, I don\u2019t have to pay taxes on that money.\u201d It gets really complicated \u2014 international tax law is very complex. But there are ways you can create subsidiaries or parts of a corporation and route your money in different ways to take advantage of the most advantageous tax laws. Jariel Arvin: Are there any countries you\u2019d say are worse than others when it comes to doing this? Jessica Green: There\u2019s a handful: Switzerland, the Netherlands, the UK with its overseas territories and protectorates like the Cayman Islands, Jersey, the Isle of Man, and Bermuda; and the Bahamas. Okay, so I think I get how these corporate tax havens work and why companies use them. But how does this relate to climate change? Is it that this kind of financial secrecy enables companies to engage in bad environmental behavior without facing economic consequences? There are two ways. One is direct: We know, for instance, that [many] firms that offshore their wealth are linked to deforestation in the Amazon. These are companies that are doing bad environmental stuff, and they have money to do that in part because they offshore some of their wealth. The second way is indirect. If you believe \u2014 as I do as a political scientist \u2014 that money is power, well: We know that fossil fuel companies are offshoring some of their profits, which makes them wealthier and therefore more powerful in their ability to influence political processes to slow down decarbonization policy. Closing tax loopholes seems like it would be a relatively simple thing for governments to do, so why do you think it isn\u2019t getting done? From my perspective, it\u2019s actually an easier political sell. Taxing the rich resonates with people a lot more than taxing carbon. First of all, people are like, \u201cWhat\u2019s carbon? I don\u2019t know. What does that mean for me? Increased costs for the basic things that I use every day?\u201d On the other hand, taxing the rich is like saying countries should take care of making sure that there\u2019s enough revenue and go get the bad guys who are not paying their fair share. How do countries actually go about \u201ctaxing the rich\u201d? There are a few ways to do that. One is unilateral: Countries can just say, \u201cIf you have goods or employ people in country X, that\u2019s where you have to report your profits, you can\u2019t report your profits someplace else.\u201d That\u2019s a unilateral measure. And politically, it could be difficult. It is a question of political will. But I think that the political sell is easier, and technically, in many ways, much less complex. We\u2019re not arguing about how to quantify and sell the absence of a thing [which is what carbon offsets would require] \u2014 we\u2019re talking about making rich people pay their fair share. Once countries do have that extra money from closing tax loopholes, how do we make sure that it actually goes to climate policy? Therein lies the rub. There\u2019s no guarantee that the money will go to the \u201cright\u201d climate causes, but what it comes down to is really thinking about climate change as a question of inequality of wealth distribution. What closing corporate tax holes will do is make these corporations and individuals less rich \u2014 and that\u2019s actually an important goal in and of itself. Because, you know, if one percent of the global population has emitted as much as the poorest 50 percent, then climate change is really a wealth inequality problem. And so to the extent that you can constrain the extreme wealth of these actors, you\u2019re taking a step in the right direction. That\u2019s my best answer to that question because it\u2019s a really hard question. I agree that this is definitely the question moving forward, and it\u2019s difficult to answer as you say. But I think it\u2019s an easier question to answer than: \u201cHow do we actually make carbon pricing work?\u201d I think so, too. We\u2019ve now had 30 years of experience on carbon pricing, and not a hell of a lot to show for it. Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Politically contentious and favorably viewed even by major polluting interests, the strategy has sparked debate over whether it's time to abandon carbon pricing in favor of more radical measures, like targeting the wealth of those primarily responsible for environmental degradation."

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Innovation is a resource we can mine. Twenty years ago, few people would have been able to imagine the energy landscape of today. In 2005, US oil production, after a long decline, had fallen to its lowest levels in decades, and few experts thought that would change.  The US invasion of Iraq had sent gasoline prices skyward. Solar and wind power provided a tiny fraction of overall electricity, showing moderate growth every year. With domestic natural gas running short, coastal states were preparing to build import terminals to bring gas from abroad. Americans were beginning to rethink their love of giant cars as the 7,000-pound Ford Excursion SUV entered its final year of production. In short, the US was preparing for a world with a rising demand for ever scarcer, more expensive fossil fuels, most of which would have to come from abroad.  That was then. Today, the energy picture couldn\u2019t be more different.  In the mid-2000s, the fracking revolution took off, making the US the largest oil and natural gas producer in the world. But clean energy began surging as well. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which created new incentives to deploy wind and solar power. Batteries became better and cheaper. Just about every carmaker now has an electric vehicle for sale. These weren\u2019t just the product of steady advances but breakthroughs \u2014 new inventions, policies, and expanding economies of scale that aligned prices and performance to push energy technologies to unexpected heights.  So what will come next? That\u2019s the challenge for those charged with building tomorrow\u2019s energy infrastructure. And right now, the world is especially uncertain about what\u2019s to come, with overall energy demand experiencing major growth for the first time in decades, in part due to power-hungry data centers behind AI. The policy chaos from the Trump administration and looming threats of tariffs are making it even harder for the global energy sector to invest and build for the future. If you\u2019re running a utility, building a factory, or designing power transmission routes, how do you even begin to plan?  To think through this conundrum, I spoke to Erin Baker. She is a professor of engineering and the faculty director of the Energy Transition Institute at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She has studied technology and policy changes in the energy sector for decades, with an eye toward how to make big decisions under uncertain circumstances.  I asked her about whether there are any other big step changes on the horizon for technologies that can help us contain climate change, and what we can do to stack the deck in their favor. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.  Can you define \u201cbreakthrough\u201d or explain how it\u2019s different from an incremental advance?  A lot of really important innovation has been incremental. We\u2019ve had amazing \u201cbreakthroughs\u201d in a way with batteries, with wind energy, but it has happened over time. An example of a kind of a breakthrough was fracking, because that was a revolution, but for a long time, everybody ignored the importance of all the various technologies horizontal drilling, shale fracture fluid, subsurface mapping] developing in the background, or didn\u2019t think it was going to happen. That one was a big step change when the price, performance, and shale gas field discoveries converged.  Whereas with solar, it just kept getting cheaper consistently faster than we expected. One way you can define \u201cbreakthrough\u201d is you can look at what everyone\u2019s expecting and see when you do better than that. So breakthroughs are kind of surprises.  So perhaps it\u2019s better to think of a breakthrough not necessarily as an invention, but rather a point at which a technology becomes viable? Right.  Then can you put the recent clean tech advances we\u2019ve seen into context? Have we seen anything like this before?  I think that we\u2019ve always had a lot of technological change. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just around clean energy. If there is some kind of incentive, then energy developers will be very clever at finding solutions. As we realize that renewable energy has a lot of benefits to it, the more we focused on it, the more we were like, \u201cWhoa, this is 10 times better than anybody thought it was going to be.\u201d  With clean energy, a big part of the rationale is its environmental and climate benefits, rather than simply profit. There\u2019s sort of a moral motivation baked in. Does that motivation matter?  For many technologies, there are always true believers. Most people who get really excited about an invention are not just trying to make a profit. I think they\u2019re almost always really into the technology itself.  So with renewable energy, people have been excited for a very, very long time. That excitement tided people over for many years when those sources weren\u2019t all that profitable. Solar took a long time for it to become great. The reason people focused on it was because of their vision that this has such potential for energy and the environment. So I think that the moral dimension does play a role. With a trade war kicking off, a lot of the raw materials and finished products in clean energy are likely to get more expensive. Is there a chance of backsliding in clean energy progress?  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to lose the technology advances. [Development] can slow down. We saw that for offshore wind, with the COVID-induced inflation and higher interest rates slowing the industry down. We\u2019re not losing any benefits of the technology though, and in fact it will probably induce new technological change. To me those kinds of things are temporary. Trade wars and stuff like that, they\u2019re bad. They will slow things down, but they won\u2019t stop innovation. There\u2019s also competition against clean energy. You talked about fracking and how that was an unexpected breakthrough. I remember in the 1990s people were talking about peak oil, and then that discussion went away because we just kept finding more oil and more exploitable resources. It seems like those same price and performance pressures on clean tech to improve also apply on the fossil side, and there\u2019s still a ton of money and innovation there. Are there any breakthroughs in fossil energy that could counteract progress in clean tech? That is a good point. Yeah, that peak oil thing used to drive me crazy. When it was a big thing, what I kept trying to explain to people that the industry will just innovate. The higher the price of oil gets, the more we\u2019re going to figure out how to get oil out of the ground.  There could be more innovations in fossil fuels, but where we are in the US, climate change is a very real problem and it\u2019s hitting people today. It\u2019s not going away. I think that the majority of focus on innovation is going to be things that can help us deal with climate change while living high-quality lives.  Being at a university, I see that the young bright students are not dying to get into fossil fuels. Most of them want to build a world that\u2019s going to be liveable for them, for their children. That gets back to what you were saying: Does it matter what the underlying reason is for innovating? And I guess when I think of it that way, it does matter. Young people want to make a better world. And so they are excited to go into clean energy, not into dirty energy. How do we start planning for another step change in clean energy? How do we prepare for stuff that we haven\u2019t invented yet? Investing in science and engineering is obviously a good idea if we want to have more kinds of scientific breakthroughs. But yeah, given that we don\u2019t know what the technology of tomorrow is going to look like, we really want to focus on flexibility and adaptability in the near term.  Something that I think is important but not always very sexy or appealing is to streamline the grid interconnection process. Every time a new energy project wants to connect to the power grid they have to get into this interconnection queue. The grid operators have to do a study and see how it\u2019s going to affect the rest of the grid. That process is really slow and inefficient; it can take years and years for things to get on the grid.  Speeding that up is something that\u2019s going to be useful broadly. You don\u2019t need to predict if it\u2019s going to be enhanced geothermal or if it\u2019s going to be new versions of solar that will win out to get that queue working better.  Similarly, we need to build new transmission where and when it\u2019s needed. It would be independent of where we end up on the energy supply side. Some of these battery technologies are facilitating distributed resources like rooftop solar and microgrids. Thinking about just how to integrate them on the main power grid would be useful.  What do you see as the government\u2019s role in facilitating this? Certainly investing in science and engineering. A lot of it is also setting goals for specific technologies. It\u2019s important because it coordinates the supply chain. That\u2019s something that state or federal governments could do if they really have a vision. It doesn\u2019t even cost very much money. A lot of it is reviewing and streamlining regulatory processes to make sure that regulation is doing what it should do.  What about things like investing in companies or offering financing to startups?  One thing that I think is really interesting is the idea of green bonds so that you can borrow money at a lower interest rate when what you\u2019re doing is good for the environment. I don\u2019t think that involves the government exactly picking companies; it just means you\u2019re making this money available if you follow certain guidelines.  Permitting risk is a kind of a bureaucratic risk, and the government could reduce that by understanding if there\u2019s going to be a huge public pushback in building a certain area rather than every developer going out to do all their own individual work.  One example is offshore wind in Europe. There, the state does a lot of work before the developers get there in understanding the specific sites. By the time they allocate the regions to build, they\u2019ve done a lot of the work that takes a lot of the risk out of it, and then they put it up for bids to private companies. Mechanisms like that can be really useful. For energy project developers, how do you decide whether to use what you can get off the shelf now versus waiting a few years, maybe another decade, for something better? A friend of mine many years ago did some research on that, and basically she found that if things are improving at a pretty fast rate, it\u2019s almost always worth it to go ahead and invest in what you have now because you\u2019re going to get a lot of value out of it. Yes, it\u2019s possible that 10 years from now, it\u2019ll be something even better, but you\u2019re already getting a lot of value from what you\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t see many developers waiting around for a better technology. I think we have a lot of good options.  Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day. Why DIY disaster preparation matters more than ever \u2014 even if it\u2019s not perfect.

        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we\u2019re committed to clarity, truth, and depth \u2014 even when it\u2019s hard. That kind of journalism isn\u2019t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? China may have met an important climate goal \u2014 ahead of schedule. China is the world\u2019s largest single greenhouse gas emitter, spewing more than double the amount of heat-trapping chemicals as the next biggest climate polluter, the United States. For decades, China\u2019s emissions soared ever higher as its economy grew, burning extraordinary volumes of coal, oil, and natural gas to light up cities, power factories, and fuel cars. The trend seemed unstoppable: At one point, China was approving two new coal power plants per week. It was an alarming prospect for the whole world. \u201cEighty-five percent of emissions for the remainder of the century are projected to occur outside the EU and the US,\u201d said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make real progress on climate change, that will require reductions from that 85 percent.\u201d And since China is the single-largest emitter, there\u2019s no feasible way to meet international climate change targets without them on board.  But now, for the first time, there\u2019s been a shift: China\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have actually fallen even as energy demand went up.  According to a new report at Carbon Brief by Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, China\u2019s overall greenhouse gas emissions have dropped for the first time, thanks largely to the country\u2019s aggressive build-out of clean energy. Looking at official statistics and commercial data, the analysis shows greenhouse gas output fell 1 percent over the past year, even as China\u2019s overall energy use and economic activity increased.  It\u2019s not a massive shift, but the fact that the curve has bent at all is a major development for the global effort against climate change.  The growth rate of humanity\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions has begun to level off, but it has yet to decline. In order to eventually halt human-caused warming, that rate has to effectively reach zero, and in order to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, that has to happen roughly within the next three decades.  The decline of emissions in China is a big step toward this international goal, and the timing puts it on course for its own climate targets, too. China had previously committed to peaking its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030.  \u201cThis is a little ahead of schedule,\u201d Greenstone said. \u201cThe planet is happy about that.\u201d In large part, the decline in emissions came from clean electricity production. China deployed vastly more wind, solar, and nuclear power \u2014 sources that don\u2019t emit carbon dioxide \u2014 at a pace faster than its electricity demand growth. Meanwhile, its coal and gas electricity production dropped. China\u2019s emissions have dipped before due to economic slowdowns, so the fact that its economy grew while emissions declined is a significant turning point, putting China in a league with more than 30 countries, including the US, that have already done the same.  China has established itself as the world\u2019s largest producer of solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and batteries, driving down prices for the global market. It\u2019s deploying these technologies within its own borders, as well as exporting them en masse, and some of its biggest customers are developing countries. That means China\u2019s investments in clean energy redound to the rest of the world. Renewables accounted for 90 percent of new power capacity installed worldwide last year.  Later this year, countries will gather in Brazil for the COP30 climate conference, where world leaders will hash out how to bring new, stronger commitments to cut their contributions to climate change by 2035. China\u2019s President Xi Jinping pledged that his country will come to the table with a comprehensive plan to further reduce its emissions across its economy, while the US may not show up at all. One his first day of his second term, President Donald Trump began the process of pulling the country out of the Paris climate agreement altogether. Again.  However, in the Carbon Brief report, Myllyvirta noted that China\u2019s small drop in emissions could easily go back up. If its economy grows even faster, demand for fossil fuels could rise again. Whether that happens depends, in part, on how the dust settles on the tariff fight between the US and China. High trade barriers would slow China\u2019s economy. Losing the US as a customer could push China to try to compensate by installing more clean energy domestically.  China also emits greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide. In particular, China is releasing high levels of HFC-23, a byproduct of making nonstick coatings and a pollutant that is thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. China committed to halting HFC-23 pollution entirely when it signed the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol in 2021.  To make China\u2019s emissions reductions durable, there needs to be more stringent policies and enforcement to curb climate pollution within the country. Otherwise, current clean energy technologies would need to get cheaper, and new ones would have to be invented. \u201cGiven the tepid appetite for aggressive carbon policy around the world, I think the most important thing the world could do is invest in early stage R&D on new energy technologies,\u201d Greenstone said.  Meanwhile, US emissions are also seeing a slight downward trend. But the Trump administration\u2019s push to extract more fossil fuels, cut incentives for clean energy, and roll back efforts to curb greenhouse gases mean that the US could become a larger climate polluter.

        "onlytext": "China may have met an important climate goal \u2014 ahead of schedule. China is the world\u2019s largest single greenhouse gas emitter, spewing more than double the amount of heat-trapping chemicals as the next biggest climate polluter, the United States. For decades, China\u2019s emissions soared ever higher as its economy grew, burning extraordinary volumes of coal, oil, and natural gas to light up cities, power factories, and fuel cars. The trend seemed unstoppable: At one point, China was approving two new coal power plants per week. It was an alarming prospect for the whole world.\n\n\u201cEighty-five percent of emissions for the remainder of the century are projected to occur outside the EU and the US,\u201d said Michael Greenstone, an economist at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make real progress on climate change, that will require reductions from that 85 percent.\u201d And since China is the single-largest emitter, there\u2019s no feasible way to meet international climate change targets without them on board.\n\nBut now, for the first time, there\u2019s been a shift: China\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions have actually fallen even as energy demand went up.  According to a new report at Carbon Brief by Lauri Myllyvirta, an analyst at Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air, China\u2019s overall greenhouse gas emissions have dropped for the first time, thanks largely to the country\u2019s aggressive build-out of clean energy. Looking at official statistics and commercial data, the analysis shows greenhouse gas output fell 1 percent over the past year, even as China\u2019s overall energy use and economic activity increased.\n\nIt\u2019s not a massive shift, but the fact that the curve has bent at all is a major development for the global effort against climate change.  The growth rate of humanity\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions has begun to level off, but it has yet to decline. In order to eventually halt human-caused warming, that rate has to effectively reach zero, and in order to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement, that has to happen roughly within the next three decades.\n\nThe decline of emissions in China is a big step toward this international goal, and the timing puts it on course for its own climate targets, too. China had previously committed to peaking its greenhouse gas emissions before 2030.  \u201cThis is a little ahead of schedule,\u201d Greenstone said. \u201cThe planet is happy about that.\u201d\n\nIn large part, the decline in emissions came from clean electricity production.

China\u2019s emissions have dipped before due to economic slowdowns, so the fact that its economy grew while emissions declined is a significant turning point, putting China in a league with more than 30 countries, including the US, that have already done the same.\n\nChina has established itself as the world\u2019s largest producer of solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles, and batteries, driving down prices for the global market. It\u2019s deploying these technologies within its own borders, as well as exporting them en masse, and some of its biggest customers are developing countries.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The big, complicated race for critical minerals, explained. The world is hungry for more stuff: televisions, phones, motors, container ships, solar panels, satellites. That means the stuff required to make stuff is in high demand, and none more so than what are known as \u201ccritical minerals.\u201d  These are a handful of elements and minerals that are particularly important for making the modern devices that run the global economy. But \u201ccritical\u201d here doesn\u2019t mean rare so much as it means essential \u2014 and alarmingly vulnerable to supply chain shocks.  In the US, the Geological Survey has flagged 50 minerals as critical to our economy and security. And including some among that larger group, the US Department of Energy is focused on 18 materials that are especially important for energy \u2014 copper for transmission lines, cobalt for cathodes in batteries, gallium for LEDs, neodymium for magnets in motors, and so on.  For governments, these minerals are more than just industrial components \u2014 they\u2019re potential bottlenecks. If producers of these substances decide to restrict access to their customers as a political lever, if prices shoot up, or if more industries develop an appetite for them and eat into the supply, companies could go bankrupt and efforts to limit climate change could slow down.  That\u2019s because these minerals are especially vital for so many clean energy technologies. They\u2019re essential for the tools used to produce, store, transmit, and use electricity without emitting greenhouse gases. They\u2019re vital to building solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. As the worldwide race for cleaner energy speeds up, the demand for these products is surging. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), mineral demands from clean energy deployment will see anywhere from a doubling to a quadrupling from current levels by 2040.  But these minerals aren\u2019t spread evenly across the world, which could leave some countries bearing most of the environmental burdens from mining critical minerals while wealthier nations reap the economic benefits and other countries get left out of the supply chain entirely. \u201cA world powered by renewables is a world hungry for critical minerals,\u201d UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said at a panel last year. \u201cFor developing countries, critical minerals are a critical opportunity \u2014 to create jobs, diversify economies, and dramatically boost revenues. But only if they are managed properly.\u201d Right now, the US is a major consumer of critical minerals, but not much of a producer \u2014 a fact that\u2019s become an obsession for the Trump administration. The president has signed several executive orders aimed at increasing critical mineral production within the US by relaxing regulations and speeding up approvals for new critical mineral extraction projects. In Congress, lawmakers are mulling spending billions of dollars to build up a critical mineral stockpile similar to the strategic petroleum reserve.  Even as the US government takes those steps, the international trade war that the Trump administration itself launched has begun to disrupt the global supply of critical minerals. China is one of the largest producers of critical minerals, particularly rare earth metals like dysprosium and terbium, but it has imposed limits on some of its critical mineral exports in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, sending prices skyward.  The dawning awareness that the critical minerals everyone needs may not be readily available has led countries to redouble their efforts to find more of these materials wherever they can \u2014 in the ocean, across deserts, and even in space. In the near term, that means the world will need more mines to expand supplies of critical minerals.  And with the market for clean energy poised to expand even further, scientists are trying to find new alternative materials that can power our world without making it hotter. But it will take more time and investment before the plentiful can replace the precious. Since the list of critical minerals is long and diverse, it\u2019s helpful to narrow it down. And one mineral stands out: lithium.  The IEA estimates that half of the mineral demand growth for clean energy will come from electric vehicles and batteries, mainly from their needs for this soft, light metal. Depending on how aggressively the world works to decarbonize, lithium use is projected to increase by as much as 51 times its current levels by 2040, more than 10 million metric tons per year.  That\u2019s because lithium is still the best material to store and release energy in batteries across a variety of applications, from the tiny cells in wireless earbuds to arrays of thousands of cells packed into giant batteries on the power grid. As more cars trade gasoline engines for electric motors, and as more intermittent wind and solar power connect to the grid, we need more ways to store energy.  While lithium is not particularly rare, getting it out of the earth isn\u2019t easy. There are only a handful of places in the world that currently have the infrastructure to extract it at scale and at a low enough price to make doing so worthwhile, even with ever rising demand.  The US produces less than 2 percent of the world\u2019s lithium, with almost all of it coming from just one mine in Nevada. The US has about 20 major sites where lithium could be extracted, according to the US Geological Survey, but building new mines can take more than a decade, and the timelines have only been getting longer. Because of their costs and the long-lasting environmental damage they can cause, mining projects have to undergo reviews before they can be approved. They often generate local opposition as well, stretching out project timelines with litigation.  But the US is motivated to build this out and there are already new lithium projects underway in places like the Salton Sea in California and the Smackover formation across the southern US. These sites would extract lithium from brine.  Could the US replace lithium and other critical minerals with cheaper, more abundant substances?  Not easily. \u201cSubstitution is not impossible, but depends on which material,\u201d Sophia Kalantzakos, who studies environmental science and public policy at NYU Abu Dhabi, said in an email. Some materials are truly one of a kind, while others have alternatives that need a lot more research and development before they can step in. For example, there are companies investing in lithium alternatives in batteries, but they also have to build up a whole supply chain to get enough of the replacement material, which can take years.  And it\u2019s not enough to mine critical minerals; they need to be refined and processed into usable forms. Here again, China leads, operating 80 percent of the world\u2019s refining capacity. The bottom line is that there\u2019s no immediate, easy answer to the critical mineral supply crunch right now. But there might be solutions that emerge in the years to come.  These challenges have spurred a wave of research and development. Engineers are already finding ways to do more with less. Automakers like Ford, Tesla, and the Chinese company BYD are increasingly turning toward lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries as an alternative to conventional lithium-ion cells. Not only does the LFP chemistry use less lithium for a given energy storage capacity, it also uses less of other critical minerals like nickel and cobalt, lowering its cost. The batteries also tend to be more durable and stable, making them less prone to catastrophic failure.  The US Department of Energy has invested in ways to make lithium-based batteries more efficient and easier to manufacture by redesigning the structure of battery components to store more energy.  Researchers are also investigating battery designs that avoid lithium altogether. Chemistries like aluminum ion and sodium ion, as their names suggest, use different and far more abundant elements to carry charges inside the battery. But they still have to catch up to lithium in terms of durability, safety, performance, and production scale.  \u201cI think this lithium-ion technology will still drive much of the energy transition,\u201d said Rachid Amui, a resource economist who coauthored a United Nations Trade & Development report on critical minerals for batteries. It will likely be decades before alternatives can dethrone lithium. Eventually, as components wear out, recycling could help meet some critical mineral needs. But demand for technologies like batteries is poised to see a huge jump, which means the world will have no choice but to grow its fresh lithium supplies.  There is some good news, though. Mining is getting more efficient and safer. \u201cThere\u2019s so much autonomous technology now being developed in the mining industry that is making mining safer than we could have ever imagined 15, 20 years ago,\u201d said Adam Simon, a professor of earth and environmental science at the University of Michigan. That\u2019s helping drive down costs and increase the efficiency of mineral extraction. The number of known sources of lithium is also rising. KoBold Metals, a mining firm backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is using AI to locate more critical mineral deposits all over the world.  The Energy Department is also throwing its weight behind domestic innovation. The department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which invests in long-shot energy ideas, is funding 18 projects to increase domestic production of critical minerals. The program, dubbed MINER, is aiming to develop minerals that can capture carbon dioxide. \u201cThrough programs like MINER and targeted investments in domestic innovation, we\u2019re working to reduce reliance on foreign sources and lay the groundwork for an American energy future that is reliable, cost-effective, and secure,\u201d said Doug Wicks, a program director for ARPA-E, in a statement to Vox.  There\u2019s also a global race to secure more mineral supplies from far-flung places, all the way down to the bottom of the ocean. On parts of the seafloor, there are vast fields of nodules made of nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese. For mining companies, the argument is that mining the seafloor could be less damaging to the environment than drilling or brine extraction on land.  But the ocean floor is anything but a desolate place; there\u2019s a lot of life down there taking many forms, including species that have yet to be discovered. One of the most lucrative areas for sea mining, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, happens to have a rich ecosystem of sponges, anemones, and sea cucumbers.  Another factor to consider is that pulling up rocks from the bottom of the sea is inevitably expensive. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone can reach 18,000 feet deep. Hauling those minerals up, shipping them to shore, and refining them adds to their sticker price.  \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting and needed because of the [research and development] that it stimulates,\u201d Simon said. \u201cBut economically, there\u2019s no company right now who could actually mine the lithium in those clays from the bottom of the ocean.\u201d There are even companies that have proposed mining critical minerals from asteroids. One company, AstroForge, has already launched a test spacecraft into deep space. That\u2019s an even dicier business proposition since working in space is even more expensive than trying to mine the bottom of the ocean. But space mining technology is a moonshot \u2014 still gestational and decades away from even returning a sample. The companies behind these proposals say that humanity\u2019s hunger for these minerals is only growing and it\u2019s prudent to start taking steps now toward building up supplies of raw materials in space. But for the time being, there\u2019s no easy way around it: Powering a greener world means we will still need to extract far more critical minerals to turn away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy. Otherwise humanity will continue extracting and burning coal, oil, and natural gas, further heating up the planet.

The US has about 20 major sites where lithium could be extracted, according to the US Geological Survey, but building new mines can take more than a decade, and the timelines have only been getting longer. Because of their costs and the long-lasting environmental damage they can cause, mining projects have to undergo reviews before they can be approved. They often generate local opposition as well, stretching out project timelines with litigation.  But the US is motivated to build this out and there are already new lithium projects underway in places like the Salton Sea in California and the Smackover formation across the southern US. These sites would extract lithium from brine.  Could the US replace lithium and other critical minerals with cheaper, more abundant substances?  Not easily. \u201cSubstitution is not impossible, but depends on which material,\u201d Sophia Kalantzakos, who studies environmental science and public policy at NYU Abu Dhabi, said in an email. Some materials are truly one of a kind, while others have alternatives that need a lot more research and development before they can step in. For example, there are companies investing in lithium alternatives in batteries, but they also have to build up a whole supply chain to get enough of the replacement material, which can take years.  And it\u2019s not enough to mine critical minerals; they need to be refined and processed into usable forms. Here again, China leads, operating 80 percent of the world\u2019s refining capacity. The bottom line is that there\u2019s no immediate, easy answer to the critical mineral supply crunch right now. But there might be solutions that emerge in the years to come.  These challenges have spurred a wave of research and development. Engineers are already finding ways to do more with less. Automakers like Ford, Tesla, and the Chinese company BYD are increasingly turning toward lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries as an alternative to conventional lithium-ion cells. Not only does the LFP chemistry use less lithium for a given energy storage capacity, it also uses less of other critical minerals like nickel and cobalt, lowering its cost. The batteries also tend to be more durable and stable, making them less prone to catastrophic failure.  The US Department of Energy has invested in ways to make lithium-based batteries more efficient and easier to manufacture by redesigning the structure of battery components to store more energy.  Researchers are also investigating battery designs that avoid lithium altogether. Chemistries like aluminum ion and sodium ion, as their names suggest, use different and far more abundant elements to carry charges inside the battery. But they still have to catch up to lithium in terms of durability, safety, performance, and production scale.  \u201cI think this lithium-ion technology will still drive much of the energy transition,\u201d said Rachid Amui, a resource economist who coauthored a United Nations Trade & Development report on critical minerals for batteries. It will likely be decades before alternatives can dethrone lithium. Eventually, as components wear out, recycling could help meet some critical mineral needs. But demand for technologies like batteries is poised to see a huge jump, which means the world will have no choice but to grow its fresh lithium supplies.  There is some good news, though. Mining is getting more efficient and safer. \u201cThere\u2019s so much autonomous technology now being developed in the mining industry that is making mining safer than we could have ever imagined 15, 20 years ago,\u201d said Adam Simon, a professor of earth and environmental science at the University of Michigan. That\u2019s helping drive down costs and increase the efficiency of mineral extraction. The number of known sources of lithium is also rising. KoBold Metals, a mining firm backed by Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is using AI to locate more critical mineral deposits all over the world.  The Energy Department is also throwing its weight behind domestic innovation. The department\u2019s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, which invests in long-shot energy ideas, is funding 18 projects to increase domestic production of critical minerals. The program, dubbed MINER, is aiming to develop minerals that can capture carbon dioxide. \u201cThrough programs like MINER and targeted investments in domestic innovation, we\u2019re working to reduce reliance on foreign sources and lay the groundwork for an American energy future that is reliable, cost-effective, and secure,\u201d said Doug Wicks, a program director for ARPA-E, in a statement to Vox.  There\u2019s also a global race to secure more mineral supplies from far-flung places, all the way down to the bottom of the ocean. On parts of the seafloor, there are vast fields of nodules made of nickel, cobalt, lithium, and manganese. For mining companies, the argument is that mining the seafloor could be less damaging to the environment than drilling or brine extraction on land.  But the ocean floor is anything but a desolate place; there\u2019s a lot of life down there taking many forms, including species that have yet to be discovered. One of the most lucrative areas for sea mining, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, happens to have a rich ecosystem of sponges, anemones, and sea cucumbers.  Another factor to consider is that pulling up rocks from the bottom of the sea is inevitably expensive. The Clarion-Clipperton Zone can reach 18,000 feet deep. Hauling those minerals up, shipping them to shore, and refining them adds to their sticker price.  \u201cI think it\u2019s interesting and needed because of the [research and development] that it stimulates,\u201d Simon said. \u201cBut economically, there\u2019s no company right now who could actually mine the lithium in those clays from the bottom of the ocean.\u201d There are even companies that have proposed mining critical minerals from asteroids. One company, AstroForge, has already launched a test spacecraft into deep space. That\u2019s an even dicier business proposition since working in space is even more expensive than trying to mine the bottom of the ocean. But space mining technology is a moonshot \u2014 still gestational and decades away from even returning a sample. The companies behind these proposals say that humanity\u2019s hunger for these minerals is only growing and it\u2019s prudent to start taking steps now toward building up supplies of raw materials in space. But for the time being, there\u2019s no easy way around it: Powering a greener world means we will still need to extract far more critical minerals to turn away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy. Otherwise humanity will continue extracting and burning coal, oil, and natural gas, further heating up the planet.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Heat domes, heat islands, mega-droughts, and climate change: The anatomy of worsening heat waves. It\u2019s gearing up to be another scorching year. Countries like Brazil, Thailand, Japan, Kenya, Nigeria, Australia, and Spain already experienced record warm temperatures this year, and in the past few days, heat has killed dozens in India and Mexico. Now states like California, Nevada, Arizona, and Texas are getting ready to roast as a massive heat wave settles in. It\u2019s likely to push temperatures well into triple digits. And summer hasn\u2019t even officially started yet. It\u2019s an alarming echo of 2023, which was the hottest year on record, but this year could be hotter still. Though the Pacific Ocean is shifting into its La Ni\u00f1a phase, which typically brings cooler global weather, the extraordinary warmth over the past year is still baked in. Scientists say these record highs align with their expectations for climate change, and warn that more scorchers are coming. There\u2019s more to heat waves like this than high temperatures, though. The forces behind them are complex and changing. They\u2019re a public health threat that can exacerbate inequality, cause infrastructure to collapse, and amplify other problems stemming from warming. But with global average temperatures continuing to rise, more records will fall. Extreme heat might not seem as dramatic as hurricanes or floods, but the National Weather Service has deemed it the deadliest weather phenomenon in the US over the past 30 years, on average. What counts as a heat wave is typically defined relative to local weather conditions, with sustained temperatures in the 90th to 95th percentile of the average in a given area. So the threshold for a heat wave in Tucson is higher than the threshold in Seattle. During the summer in the Northern Hemisphere, the northern half of the planet is tilted toward the sun, which increases daylight hours and warms the hemisphere. The impact of this additional exposure to solar radiation is cumulative, which is why temperatures generally peak weeks after the longest day of the year. Amid the increase in temperatures in the summer, meteorology can push those numbers to extremes. Heat waves typically begin with a high-pressure system (also known as an anticyclone), where atmospheric pressure above an area builds up. That creates a sinking column of air that compresses, heats up, and oftentimes dries out. The sinking air can act as a cap or heat dome, trapping the latent heat already absorbed by the landscape. The high-pressure system also pushes out cooler, fast-moving air currents and squeezes clouds away, which gives the sun an unobstructed line of sight to the ground. The ground \u2014 soil, sand, concrete, and asphalt \u2014 then bakes in the sunlight, and in the long days and short nights of summer, heat energy quickly accumulates and temperatures rise. Heat waves are especially common in areas that are already arid, like the desert Southwest, and at high altitudes where high-pressure systems readily form. Moisture in the ground can blunt the effects of heat, the way evaporating sweat can cool the body. But when there\u2019s little water in the ground, in waterways, and in vegetation, there isn\u2019t as much to soak up the heat besides the air itself. \u201cIt compounds on itself,\u201d said Jonathan Martin, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Wisconsin Madison. \u201cWhen you\u2019re dry, you get warm. When you\u2019re excessively warm, you tend to build and strengthen the anticyclone, which encourages continuation of clear skies, which in turn encourages a lack of precipitation, which makes it drier, which makes the incoming solar radiation more able to heat the ground.\u201d But extreme heat can also build up in places that have a lot of moisture. In fact, for every degree Celsius the air warms (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit), it can absorb about 7 percent more water, which can create a dangerous combination of heat and humidity (more on that below). Urban areas further exacerbate this warming. As roads, parking lots, and buildings cover natural landscapes, cities like Los Angeles and Dallas end up absorbing more heat than their surroundings and can become as much as 20\u00b0F warmer. This is a phenomenon known as the urban heat island effect. Heat waves typically last around five days but can linger longer if the high-pressure system is locked in place. \u201cIn some cases, you actually can get these kinds of patterns getting stuck, and that can lead to heat waves lasting much longer,\u201d said Karen McKinnon, an assistant professor of environment and sustainability at the University of California Los Angeles. Eventually, the high-pressure system will start to weaken, allowing in cooler air and precipitation that can bring the heat wave to an end. However, as the warm season continues, more high-pressure systems can settle in and restart the heating process. It can be tricky to tease out how a specific weather event was influenced by climate change, but scientists in recent years have been developing models and experiments to figure out just how much humanity\u2019s hunger for fossil fuels is making individual disasters worse. It\u2019s part of a subfield of climatology known as attribution science, and extreme heat is the classical example. \u201cHeat waves were actually the extreme events that attribution science were pioneered around,\u201d said Jane W. Baldwin, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. \u201cAlmost any kind of metric related to heat waves you can imagine is getting worse and is projected to get worse.\u201d Climate change caused by greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels is poised to make heat waves longer, more intense, and more frequent. It takes time for the dust to settle on the heat waves of a given moment, to allow scientists to evaluate just how much humans have contributed to the problem. But researchers looking at past events and other parts of the world have already found that humans share a huge portion of the blame. After a summer 2019 heat wave was blamed for 2,500 deaths in Western Europe, a study found that climate change made the heat five times as likely as it would have been in a world that hadn\u2019t warmed. Heat waves in the ocean have become 20 times as likely as average temperatures have risen. And researchers reported that the 2020 heat wave in Siberia was 600 times as likely due to climate change than not. The mechanism is simple: The burning of fossil fuels adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, which traps more heat energy and pushes up average temperatures \u2014 which, in turn, also pushes up extreme temperatures. That heat isn\u2019t distributed evenly, however. Nighttime temperatures are rising faster than daytime temperatures. \u201cIn general, since records began in 1895, summer overnight low temperatures are warming at a rate nearly twice as fast as afternoon high temperatures for the U.S. and the 10 warmest summer minimum temperatures have all occurred since 2002,\u201d according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This can seriously impair how people cope with high heat. The effects of warming can vary by latitude, too. Polar regions are warming up to three times as fast as the planetary average, fueling heat waves in the Arctic. In fact, cooler parts of the planet are heating up faster than places closer to the equator, so people living in temperate climates may experience some of the biggest increases in extreme heat events. Already hot parts of the world also get hotter, pushing them beyond the realm of habitability at certain times of the year. And as human-generated greenhouse gas emissions continue to flood the atmosphere \u2014 atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations recently peaked at 420 parts per million \u2014 heat waves are projected to become more frequent and more extreme. While there is some debate about whether extreme heat or extreme cold has a larger public health impact overall, it\u2019s clear that high temperatures exact a huge toll in terms of health and the economy. Here\u2019s how the impacts of scalding temperatures ripple throughout the world and how they\u2019re shifting as the planet warms. Heat waves have major direct and indirect health effects: Extreme heat caused an average of 138 deaths per year in the US between 1991 and 2020, according to the National Weather Service. High temperatures increase the likelihood of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. They can raise blood pressure, make certain medications less effective, and worsen neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis. Air pollution also gets worse as rising temperatures increase the rate of formation of hazards like ozone. Such pollutants in turn exacerbate heart and lung problems. The rise in nighttime temperatures is particularly worrisome for public health. Without much overnight cooling, people living through a heat wave experience higher cumulative heat stress, increasing risks of problems like dehydration and disrupting sleep, which can further worsen exhaustion and stress from high temperatures. Alongside the heat, another important factor to consider for human health is humidity. The amount of moisture in the air affects how well sweat can evaporate off the body and cool it off. In some parts of the world, like the southwestern US, heat waves have become drier. But in other regions like the Persian Gulf and South Asia, higher temperatures are instead increasing humidity. The key metric here is known as the wet-bulb temperature, where a thermometer is wrapped in a damp cloth, revealing the lowest temperature achievable by evaporative cooling (i.e., sweating) under a given set of heat and humidity conditions. The upper limit wet-bulb temperature for human survival is 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), during which even standing in the shade with unlimited water can be life-threatening. Since 1979, these dangerous conditions have become twice as common in several regions of the world, including South Asia and the Persian Gulf, researchers found in 2020. They warned that further warming this century could render many of the most densely populated parts of the world uninhabitable during the hottest times of year. The timing of heat waves is changing: Periods of extreme heat that occur early in the season tend to have greater public health impacts. That\u2019s because people are less acclimated to heat in the spring and early summer. Cooling infrastructure may not be in place, and people may not be taking heat precautions like staying hydrated and avoiding the sun. That\u2019s why early-season heat waves in the US, as we have seen across the country this year, are so troubling. As climate change makes heat waves more common, it also increases the frequency of early- and late-season extreme temperatures, lengthening the hot season. The worst effects of heat aren\u2019t always in the hottest places: While absolute temperatures may rise higher in already warm areas like the southwestern US, heat waves can have their deadliest impacts in cooler regions, where high temperatures are less common. Warmer areas often already have air conditioning in homes and offices, while regions that usually don\u2019t get as warm have less cooling infrastructure and fewer places to find relief. The people in these regions are also less acclimated to high temperatures and may not recognize warning signs of heat-induced health problems. Some people are far more vulnerable to extreme heat: Elderly people and very young children face some of the highest risks from extreme heat. People with certain health conditions, like high blood pressure and breathing difficulties, also face greater harm. But even otherwise healthy people can suffer from heat waves if they are exposed for long durations, such as those working outdoors in agriculture and construction. Heat waves exacerbate structural inequalities: While cities can warm up faster than their surroundings, poorer neighborhoods \u2014 which are disproportionately home to people of color \u2014 tend to get hotter. These neighborhoods often have less tree cover and green spaces, and more paved surfaces that soak up heat. At the same time, lower-income residents may have a harder time affording crucial cooling. The pattern of heat inequality plays out on an international scale, too, with lower-income countries already facing higher health and economic costs from heat waves. The tools used to cope with heat are also stressed by it: Power plants, which provide electricity for everything from fridges to air conditioners, themselves need to be cooled, and they become less efficient as the weather warms. Power lines have lower capacities under extreme heat, and hardware like transformers experience more failures. If enough stress builds up, the power grid can collapse just when people need cooling the most. Power disruptions then ripple through other infrastructure, like water sanitation, fuel pumps, and public transit. We\u2019re running out of time to act: All this means that heat waves are going to become an increasingly impactful and costly fact of life across the world \u2014 from the direct impacts on health to stresses on infrastructure. But since humans share a significant portion of the blame for extreme heat waves, there are also actions people can take to mitigate them. Increasing energy efficiency can relieve stress on the power grid, and adding power sources that don\u2019t require active cooling like wind and solar can boost capacity without adding greenhouse gas emissions. Improving public health outreach and providing more cooling resources and education, particularly in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, could reduce some of the worst human effects. \u201cBasically all of the damages from heat waves, at least on the health side, are preventable if we warn people effectively and just help our neighbors during an event,\u201d Baldwin said. Humanity must curb its output of heat-trapping gases to limit just how hot the planet will get. It may take years or decades for these reductions to show up in the climate system, but they have to begin now.

The effects of warming can vary by latitude, too. Polar regions are warming up to three times as fast as the planetary average, fueling heat waves in the Arctic. In fact, cooler parts of the planet are heating up faster than places closer to the equator, so people living in temperate climates may experience some of the biggest increases in extreme heat events. Already hot parts of the world also get hotter, pushing them beyond the realm of habitability at certain times of the year.\n\nAnd as human-generated greenhouse gas emissions continue to flood the atmosphere \u2014 atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations recently peaked at 420 parts per million \u2014 heat waves are projected to become more frequent and more extreme. While there is some debate about whether extreme heat or extreme cold has a larger public health impact overall, it\u2019s clear that high temperatures exact a huge toll in terms of health and the economy.\n\nHere\u2019s how the impacts of scalding temperatures ripple throughout the world and how they\u2019re shifting as the planet warms. Heat waves have major direct and indirect health effects: Extreme heat caused an average of 138 deaths per year in the US between 1991 and 2020, according to the National Weather Service. High temperatures increase the likelihood of heat exhaustion and heat stroke. They can raise blood pressure, make certain medications less effective, and worsen neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis. Air pollution also gets worse as rising temperatures increase the rate of formation of hazards like ozone. Such pollutants in turn exacerbate heart and lung problems.\n\nThe rise in nighttime temperatures is particularly worrisome for public health. Without much overnight cooling, people living through a heat wave experience higher cumulative heat stress, increasing risks of problems like dehydration and disrupting sleep, which can further worsen exhaustion and stress from high temperatures. Alongside the heat, another important factor to consider for human health is humidity. The amount of moisture in the air affects how well sweat can evaporate off the body and cool it off.\n\nIn some parts of the world, like the southwestern US, heat waves have become drier. But in other regions like the Persian Gulf and South Asia, higher temperatures are instead increasing humidity. The key metric here is known as the wet-bulb temperature, where a thermometer is wrapped in a damp cloth, revealing the lowest temperature achievable by evaporative cooling (i.e., sweating) under a given set of heat and humidity conditions. The upper limit wet-bulb temperature for human survival is 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), during which even standing in the shade with unlimited water can be life-threatening.\n\nSince 1979, these dangerous conditions have become twice as common in several regions of the world, including South Asia and the Persian Gulf, researchers found in 2020. They warned that further warming this century could render many of the most densely populated parts of the world uninhabitable during the hottest times of year.\n\nThe timing of heat waves is changing: Periods of extreme heat that occur early in the season tend to have greater public health impacts. That\u2019s because people are less acclimated to heat in the spring and early summer. Cooling infrastructure may not be in place, and people may not be taking heat precautions like staying hydrated and avoiding the sun. That\u2019s why early-season heat waves in the US, as we have seen across the country this year, are so troubling.\n\nAs climate change makes heat waves more common, it also increases the frequency of early- and late-season extreme temperatures, lengthening the hot season. The worst effects of heat aren\u2019t always in the hottest places: While absolute temperatures may rise higher in already warm areas like the southwestern US, heat waves can have their deadliest impacts in cooler regions, where high temperatures are less common.\n\nWarmer areas often already have air conditioning in homes and offices, while regions that usually don\u2019t get as warm have less cooling infrastructure and fewer places to find relief. The people in these regions are also less acclimated to high temperatures and may not recognize warning signs of heat-induced health problems.\n\nSome people are far more vulnerable to extreme heat: Elderly people and very young children face some of the highest risks from extreme heat. People with certain health conditions, like high blood pressure and breathing difficulties, also face greater harm. But even otherwise healthy people can suffer from heat waves if they are exposed for long durations, such as those working outdoors in agriculture and construction.\n\nHeat waves exacerbate structural inequalities: While cities can warm up faster than their surroundings, poorer neighborhoods \u2014 which are disproportionately home to people of color \u2014 tend to get hotter. These neighborhoods often have less tree cover and green spaces, and more paved surfaces that soak up heat. At the same time, lower-income residents may have a harder time affording crucial cooling.\n\nThe pattern of heat inequality plays out on an international scale, too, with lower-income countries already facing higher health and economic costs from heat waves.\n\nThe tools used to cope with heat are also stressed by it: Power plants, which provide electricity for everything from fridges to air conditioners, themselves need to be cooled, and they become less efficient as the weather warms. Power lines have lower capacities under extreme heat, and hardware like transformers experience more failures. If enough stress builds up, the power grid can collapse just when people need cooling the most.\n\nPower disruptions then ripple through other infrastructure, like water sanitation, fuel pumps, and public transit.\n\nWe\u2019re running out of time to act: All this means that heat waves are going to become an increasingly impactful and costly fact of life across the world \u2014 from the direct impacts on health to stresses on infrastructure. But since humans share a significant portion of the blame for extreme heat waves, there are also actions people can take to mitigate them.\n\nIncreasing energy efficiency can relieve stress on the power grid, and adding power sources that don\u2019t require active cooling like wind and solar can boost capacity without adding greenhouse gas emissions. Improving public health outreach and providing more cooling resources and education, particularly in the most vulnerable neighborhoods, could reduce some of the worst human effects.\n\n\u201cBasically all of the damages from heat waves, at least on the health side, are preventable if we warn people effectively and just help our neighbors during an event,\u201d Baldwin said.\n\nHumanity must curb its output of heat-trapping gases to limit just how hot the planet will get. It may take years or decades for these reductions to show up in the climate system, but they have to begin now.",

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The natural gas industry was losing in cities across the US. Then came an obscure partisan tactic called preemption. When Regina Romero took office as the Democratic mayor of Tucson, Arizona, in 2019, she wanted her city to take action on climate change. Local building codes might have been a logical place to start: In the US, some 70 million buildings rely on fossil fuels that warm the planet, such as oil and gas, for heating and cooking. They generate a hefty 13 percent of national greenhouse gas emissions. While many answers to climate change require national and even international action, cities often have the unilateral power to craft local rules like building codes. But before the city of Tucson could even look at possible building reforms, the Republican-led state legislature took away its power to do so \u2014 by passing a state law that natural gas utilities are \u201cnot subject to further regulation by a municipality.\u201d Supporters of the Republican bill were trying to beat climate advocates to the punch and \u201cpreempt\u201d restrictions on fossil fuels. \u201cWe wanted to get ahead of what we viewed as an economically damaging trend, and stop it before it could gain a foothold here,\u201d says Garrick Taylor, a spokesperson for the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry, one of the lobbying groups that supported the bill. Vox\u2019s German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration\u2019s burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday. With those few lines of text, Arizona blocked a path for cleaning up a significant source of Tucson\u2019s climate pollution \u2014 even as nations around the world are racing to transition to cleaner energy and slow disastrous climate change. The Arizona law \u201cmade it more difficult for local governments to act on climate change,\u201d Mayor Romero said in a statement to Vox. The law is \u201climiting the pool of potential policy solutions we can enact ... tying the hands of local officials in Arizona, inhibiting progress and innovation in our cities and towns,\u201d she added. Arizona was the first of many US states where \u201clocalities are cut off at the knees, because they\u2019re in states where lawmakers are hostile\u201d to these kinds of climate regulations, says Sheila Foster, a Georgetown University professor who specializes in urban environmental law.  Interest groups for the natural gas industry, worried about losing energy customers, have now promoted bills in half the country to strip cities of basic powers to set greener building codes and help phase out fossil-fuel pollution. These \u201cpreemption\u201d laws have swept through 20 state legislatures; three more states have bills pending this year. American government has always involved power-sharing among federal, state, and local governments. When federal and state laws clash, the federal law typically \u201cpreempts\u201d the state law, and the state law must give way. Similarly, state governments often have the power to preempt laws passed by local governments. But legal scholars say that the wave of state laws preventing local climate action and other progressive priorities, which they call \u201cnew preemption,\u201d is different. States are increasingly using preemption as a partisan tool that prevents any regulation on a given issue. Foster likens the tactic to a \u201cpartisan hit-job,\u201d while University of Virginia law expert Richard Schragger calls it an \u201cattack on American cities.\u201d Local policies like building codes may seem unimportant in the larger context of the climate crisis, but they turn out to be a hidden linchpin in the fossil-fuel economy. Your home may depend on oil or gas for heating, power, and various appliances. You may pipe gas, for example, directly into your kitchen stove.  Even as President Joe Biden tries to change the country\u2019s course with wide-ranging climate policies at the federal level, Republicans and the fossil fuel industry have been wildly successful at propping up gas on the state level. And because local action is critical to meeting national and international goals, these tactics could pose a threat not only to climate activists\u2019 ambitions, but to the future of the planet. They show that Republicans and their fossil fuel allies can block climate action even without controlling Congress or the White House.  Americans who may not be familiar with the term \u201cpreemption\u201d are still feeling its sweeping effects. The strategy of state-by-state preemption was pioneered in part by the tobacco industry, which wanted to stem a flood of smoking regulations in the 1990s and 2000s. It has been advanced by the National Rifle Association to restrict gun regulations in cities. Republicans have also used this strategy during the pandemic. In April 2020, Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order that said it overrode \u201cany conflicting official action or order issued by local officials in response to COVID-19.\u201d Governors in Georgia, Arkansas, and Mississippi followed suit. Other Republican-controlled states, like Texas, have set policies that stop cities from setting mask and vaccine mandates. There\u2019s an irony to this emerging conservative playbook: Lawmakers on the right have often argued \u2014 on issues as varied as guns, voting, the environment, and public health \u2014 that the federal and state government should not overreach by encroaching on local rights to govern. With new preemption, conservative lawmakers are arguably doing what they complain about: stripping local leaders and voters of their autonomy. Now Democratic lawmakers are complaining about Republican overreach. A pending state preemption bill in the Pennsylvania legislature, for example, would limit Philadelphia\u2019s ability to encourage energy efficiency and electrification. Derek Green, a member of the city council, worries that the bill could create \u201cartificial restrictions\u201d that tie local regulators\u2019 hands.  \u201cIt does not help constituents in this city,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt creates an inaccurate market, because it doesn\u2019t allow you to continue to be creative and innovative in local ideas and opportunities.\u201d Some US cities responded to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency by becoming leaders in local climate action. In 2019, environmentalists heralded Berkeley, California, as the first city to pass an ordinance requiring all new construction to be powered by electricity instead of gas. Berkeley helped prove that despite Trump\u2019s rollback of national climate policies, progress on climate goals could accelerate locally. As of September 2021, at least 50 other cities and counties in California have followed suit, passing variations on new building codes that would help to phase out fossil fuels in their building sectors. Together, this kind of local action can make a monumental difference in addressing climate change. Policies that cities, states, and businesses already have on the books are expected to lower the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by almost a fifth in the next five years. More ambitious policies could achieve cuts of up to 37 percent by 2030, according to a 2020 report from the climate advocacy group America Is All In. Without help from local governments, even the ambitious climate proposals in Biden\u2019s $3.5 trillion reconciliation package won\u2019t be enough to cut US emissions by half in the next decade. One powerful way to shrink these emissions would be to embed clean technologies in new construction. For example, it\u2019s cheaper to outfit buildings from the outset with electric heaters and stoves than to replace them later on. The world\u2019s top climate science organization, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, wrote in 2018 that the \u201cbuildings sector is characterized by very long-living infrastructure,\u201d so \u201cimmediate steps are hence important to avoid lock-in of inefficient carbon and energy-intensive buildings.\u201d  In other words, it often takes many years for anyone to upgrade dirty technology or remodel an older home or office. Gas-powered buildings will always pollute, while electrified buildings will become cleaner as the power sector switches to renewables. Local climate policies can only make progress if state laws don\u2019t get in the way \u2014 and Republicans have been very effective at winning control of state governments. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these blue islands \u2014 cities and urban areas \u2014 getting bluer, and wanting more progressive policy in red states, where the state leaders don\u2019t agree,\u201d Foster says. Republicans who support preemption bills throughout the country say they\u2019re not preempting local governance, but fighting for \u201cenergy choice,\u201d arguing that a city shouldn\u2019t pick and choose what energy sources customers rely on. They say they\u2019re preventing extreme environmental priorities from engulfing states and raising energy bills for consumers. \u201cWe have been able to observe what happens in cities like Berkeley, California, that take these radical steps to tell people: \u2018This is what you will use, whether you like it or not,\u2019\u201d said Mark Finchem, an Arizona state representative, in a 2020 floor debate, NPR reported. \u201cActivists across the nation, even right here in Florida, are pursuing bans on natural gas as an energy source,\u201d said Josie Tomkow, a Florida state representative who co-sponsored a 2021 preemption bill that is complicating city campaigns for clean energy. Their stance closely mirrors arguments that seem to have originated in the natural gas industry. In 2019, the chair of the nation\u2019s top natural gas trade group, the American Gas Association, suggested that the industry was under siege from environmental regulation. \u201cThe current narrative has shifted from attacking production and transmission of natural gas, e.g., anti-fracking and anti-pipelines, to removing energy choice for communities and limiting or prohibiting customer access to natural gas,\u201d the chair said, according to meeting minutes that the watchdog group Climate Investigations Center obtained by public records requests.  The map below, from a 2020 briefing for an American Gas Association board meeting, shows where members of the trade group campaigned for preemption laws. According to the map, gas utilities in states highlighted in turquoise \u2014 Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Oklahoma \u2014 worked to pass \u201clegislation to protect consumers\u2019 energy choice.\u201d The association was directly involved in at least one state, Tennessee, asking a utility over email to support the bill, the Guardian reported. A spokesperson for the American Gas Association told Vox that the trade group was \u201csupportive of the effort in states to produce a choice of utilities for their constituents.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not actively involved in any of the efforts,\u201d the spokesperson added, though the group\u2019s documents listed them as a priority in 2020. One of the association\u2019s top goals that year was to \u201cexpand efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure policies, regulations and other initiatives include the option of natural gas for consumers and preserve customer choice of energy,\u201d the briefing says. Richard Meyer, an energy markets and standards executive for the American Gas Association, told Vox that states should be \u201ckeeping all options on the table,\u201d arguing that they would not necessarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating gas in buildings. Climate advocates told Vox that arguments like Meyer\u2019s seem deliberately short-sighted. Right now, it\u2019s true that some buildings might switch from natural gas to electricity and wind up drawing energy from coal or gas power plants. But in the decades or even centuries that these buildings are around, the grid will get cleaner, and so will electrified buildings. Calling these bills \u201cenergy choice\u201d legislation is also misleading, says David Pomerantz, director of the environmental group Energy and Policy Institute. A building\u2019s energy source is not usually an individual\u2019s decision to start with, because the infrastructure that\u2019s available depends on policies in their zip code. \u201cNo one person is drilling for gas in their backyard and piping it into their kitchen,\u201d he says.  The bottom line is that the more new buildings that pipe in fossil fuels like natural gas, the slower the transition to alternative sources of energy, and the less time the world has to stave off climate catastrophe.  Before it empowered state Republicans and the gas industry, \u201cpreemption was a critically important part\u201d of shielding the tobacco industry from regulators, according to Allan M. Brandt, a Harvard historian of medicine who wrote The Cigarette Century. Big Tobacco helped block many cities from banning smoking in public spaces during the 1990s and 2000s, for example, as part of a strategy that\u2019s now known as the \u201ctobacco playbook.\u201d \u201cOther incredibly harmful industries have followed this idea of preempting other forms of regulation, through agreements that looked like they were positive, but what they really did was restrict future regulatory legislation and action,\u201d Brandt says. The tactic gained steam in the 2010s, starting when the Tea Party helped Republicans win state legislatures across the country. As governors and legislatures have gone red, preemption has helped them achieve \u201cderegulation without replacement,\u201d says Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor who studies local governance. Lobbying interests use this tactic to block the will of voters, Briffault says, and tend to focus on state politics instead of launching individual fights in hundreds of cities across the country. By concentrating on the states, where they have more power, lobbyists can concentrate their considerable resources on the politicians already listening, instead of trying to gain influence locally.  \u201cThis is a pretty tried-and-true playbook,\u201d says Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law. For instance, American Legislative Exchange Council, a lobbying group that advances corporate legislation at the state level, has pushed preemption bills in dozens of states. Over the years, lawmakers have used state preemption to target local bans on plastic bags, plastic straws, and fracking, as well as local efforts to increase the minimum wage. \u201cWe have certain cities across the states trying to implement their own community-level minimum wage policies,\u201d said Taylor, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry spokesperson. He said his organization supports preemption of laws and regulations that, in their view, cause statewide \u201cdisruption\u201d and \u201cbureaucracy.\u201d When you understand the playbook, you begin to see variations on it everywhere. In Berkeley, the gas utility SoCalGas has argued in a state lawsuit \u2014 along with the California Restaurant Association \u2014 that Berkeley\u2019s codes conflict with federal law and should be thrown out. In Spokane, Washington, local gas utilities backed a local referendum to stop the city from pursuing cleaner building codes. (A Washington state court recently threw out the referendum.) Federal lawmakers have also attempted to attach preemption to national legislation: Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) offered an amendment to the infrastructure bill that would have prevented cities from using federal funds to limit natural gas, S&P Global reported. So far, these efforts have been unsuccessful.  The state-by-state trend has continued, however. Texas passed a preemption law earlier this year, and the city of Austin has been feeling its effects. A city council member in Austin, Greg Casar, says that the Texas preemption law has hurt the city\u2019s efforts to ensure new building projects don\u2019t hook up to gas pipelines. The preemption law \u201cdoes reduce the tools that we have to require new buildings to be hooked up to electricity, rather than to gas,\u201d Casar told Vox. Austin still has some tools, like using tax benefits to encourage electric hookups, but the city can\u2019t penalize builders for hooking up to gas. It\u2019s difficult to change a city with incentives alone, Casar says. \u201cIt\u2019s always harder to reach goals, not having both carrots and sticks,\u201d he says. Short of changing the political makeup of state legislatures, cities don\u2019t have much recourse against preemption. In most cases, it\u2019s not clear Republicans are breaking any laws with preemption bills, even as their tactics get bolder and bolder. As the gas industry runs out of thoroughly red states to advance preemption in, similar bills have popped up in states like Pennsylvania and Colorado. \u201cWhat\u2019s most worrying is the continued trend of the legislature favoring oil and gas interests over taking any form of action on climate change,\u201d Casar says. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing for them not to do much \u2014 it\u2019s another for them to actually get in the way of what cities are able to do.\u201d Correction, September 30, 10 am: An earlier version of this article misidentified the California Restaurant Association as its partner organization, the National Restaurant Association.

But legal scholars say that the wave of state laws preventing local climate action and other progressive priorities, which they call \u201cnew preemption,\u201d is different. States are increasingly using preemption as a partisan tool that prevents any regulation on a given issue. Foster likens the tactic to a \u201cpartisan hit-job,\u201d while University of Virginia law expert Richard Schragger calls it an \u201cattack on American cities.\u201d\n\nLocal policies like building codes may seem unimportant in the larger context of the climate crisis, but they turn out to be a hidden linchpin in the fossil-fuel economy. Your home may depend on oil or gas for heating, power, and various appliances. You may pipe gas, for example, directly into your kitchen stove.\n\nEven as President Joe Biden tries to change the country\u2019s course with wide-ranging climate policies at the federal level, Republicans and the fossil fuel industry have been wildly successful at propping up gas on the state level. And because local action is critical to meeting national and international goals, these tactics could pose a threat not only to climate activists\u2019 ambitions, but to the future of the planet.\n\nThey show that Republicans and their fossil fuel allies can block climate action even without controlling Congress or the White House.\n\nAmericans who may not be familiar with the term \u201cpreemption\u201d are still feeling its sweeping effects. The strategy of state-by-state preemption was pioneered in part by the tobacco industry, which wanted to stem a flood of smoking regulations in the 1990s and 2000s. It has been advanced by the National Rifle Association to restrict gun regulations in cities. Republicans have also used this strategy during the pandemic. In April 2020, Florida\u2019s Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order that said it overrode \u201cany conflicting official action or order issued by local officials in response to COVID-19.\u201d Governors in Georgia, Arkansas, and Mississippi followed suit. Other Republican-controlled states, like Texas, have set policies that stop cities from setting mask and vaccine mandates.\n\nThere\u2019s an irony to this emerging conservative playbook: Lawmakers on the right have often argued \u2014 on issues as varied as guns, voting, the environment, and public health \u2014 that the federal and state government should not overreach by encroaching on local rights to govern. With new preemption, conservative lawmakers are arguably doing what they complain about: stripping local leaders and voters of their autonomy.\n\nNow Democratic lawmakers are complaining about Republican overreach. A pending state preemption bill in the Pennsylvania legislature, for example, would limit Philadelphia\u2019s ability to encourage energy efficiency and electrification. Derek Green, a member of the city council, worries that the bill could create \u201cartificial restrictions\u201d that tie local regulators\u2019 hands.\n\n\u201cIt does not help constituents in this city,\u201d Green said. \u201cIt creates an inaccurate market, because it doesn\u2019t allow you to continue to be creative and innovative in local ideas and opportunities.\u201d\n\nSome US cities responded to Donald Trump\u2019s presidency by becoming leaders in local climate action. In 2019, environmentalists heralded Berkeley, California, as the first city to pass an ordinance requiring all new construction to be powered by electricity instead of gas. Berkeley helped prove that despite Trump\u2019s rollback of national climate policies, progress on climate goals could accelerate locally.\n\nAs of September 2021, at least 50 other cities and counties in California have followed suit, passing variations on new building codes that would help to phase out fossil fuels in their building sectors. Together, this kind of local action can make a monumental difference in addressing climate change. Policies that cities, states, and businesses already have on the books are expected to lower the country\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions by almost a fifth in the next five years. More ambitious policies could achieve cuts of up to 37 percent by 2030, according to a 2020 report from the climate advocacy group America Is All In.\n\nWithout help from local governments, even the ambitious climate proposals in Biden\u2019s $3.5 trillion reconciliation package won\u2019t be enough to cut US emissions by half in the next decade. One powerful way to shrink these emissions would be to embed clean technologies in new construction. For example, it\u2019s cheaper to outfit buildings from the outset with electric heaters and stoves than to replace them later on.\n\nThe world\u2019s top climate science organization, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, wrote in 2018 that the \u201cbuildings sector is characterized by very long-living infrastructure,\u201d so \u201cimmediate steps are hence important to avoid lock-in of inefficient carbon and energy-intensive buildings.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it often takes many years for anyone to upgrade dirty technology or remodel an older home or office. Gas-powered buildings will always pollute, while electrified buildings will become cleaner as the power sector switches to renewables.\n\nLocal climate policies can only make progress if state laws don\u2019t get in the way \u2014 and Republicans have been very effective at winning control of state governments. \u201cYou\u2019ve got these blue islands \u2014 cities and urban areas \u2014 getting bluer, and wanting more progressive policy in red states, where the state leaders don\u2019t agree,\u201d Foster says.\n\nRepublicans who support preemption bills throughout the country say they\u2019re not preempting local governance, but fighting for \u201cenergy choice,\u201d arguing that a city shouldn\u2019t pick and choose what energy sources customers rely on. They say they\u2019re preventing extreme environmental priorities from engulfing states and raising energy bills for consumers.\n\n\u201cWe have been able to observe what happens in cities like Berkeley, California, that take these radical steps to tell people: \u2018This is what you will use, whether you like it or not,\u2019\u201d said Mark Finchem, an Arizona state representative, in a 2020 floor debate, NPR reported.\n\n\u201cActivists across the nation, even right here in Florida, are pursuing bans on natural gas as an energy source,\u201d said Josie Tomkow, a Florida state representative who co-sponsored a 2021 preemption bill that is complicating city campaigns for clean energy.\n\nTheir stance closely mirrors arguments that seem to have originated in the natural gas industry. In 2019, the chair of the nation\u2019s top natural gas trade group, the American Gas Association, suggested that the industry was under siege from environmental regulation. \u201cThe current narrative has shifted from attacking production and transmission of natural gas, e.g., anti-fracking and anti-pipelines, to removing energy choice for communities and limiting or prohibiting customer access to natural gas,\u201d the chair said, according to meeting minutes that the watchdog group Climate Investigations Center obtained by public records requests.\n\nThe map below, from a 2020 briefing for an American Gas Association board meeting, shows where members of the trade group campaigned for preemption laws. According to the map, gas utilities in states highlighted in turquoise \u2014 Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Oklahoma \u2014 worked to pass \u201clegislation to protect consumers\u2019 energy choice.\u201d The association was directly involved in at least one state, Tennessee, asking a utility over email to support the bill, the Guardian reported.\n\nA spokesperson for the American Gas Association told Vox that the trade group was \u201csupportive of the effort in states to produce a choice of utilities for their constituents.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not actively involved in any of the efforts,\u201d the spokesperson added, though the group\u2019s documents listed them as a priority in 2020.\n\nOne of the association\u2019s top goals that year was to \u201cexpand efforts at the federal, state, and local levels to ensure policies, regulations and other initiatives include the option of natural gas for consumers and preserve customer choice of energy,\u201d the briefing says.\n\nRichard Meyer, an energy markets and standards executive for the American Gas Association, told Vox that states should be \u201ckeeping all options on the table,\u201d arguing that they would not necessarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating gas in buildings.\n\nClimate advocates told Vox that arguments like Meyer\u2019s seem deliberately short-sighted. Right now, it\u2019s true that some buildings might switch from natural gas to electricity and wind up drawing energy from coal or gas power plants. But in the decades or even centuries that these buildings are around, the grid will get cleaner, and so will electrified buildings.\n\nCalling these bills \u201cenergy choice\u201d legislation is also misleading, says David Pomerantz, director of the environmental group Energy and Policy Institute. A building\u2019s energy source is not usually an individual\u2019s decision to start with, because the infrastructure that\u2019s available depends on policies in their zip code.\n\n\u201cNo one person is drilling for gas in their backyard and piping it into their kitchen,\u201d he says.\n\nThe bottom line is that the more new buildings that pipe in fossil fuels like natural gas, the slower the transition to alternative sources of energy, and the less time the world has to stave off climate catastrophe.\n\nBefore it empowered state Republicans and the gas industry, \u201cpreemption was a critically important part\u201d of shielding the tobacco industry from regulators, according to Allan M. Brandt, a Harvard historian of medicine who wrote The Cigarette Century.\n\nBig Tobacco helped block many cities from banning smoking in public spaces during the 1990s and 2000s, for example, as part of a strategy that\u2019s now known as the \u201ctobacco playbook.\u201d\n\n\u201cOther incredibly harmful industries have followed this idea of preempting other forms of regulation, through agreements that looked like they were positive, but what they really did was restrict future regulatory legislation and action,\u201d Brandt says.\n\nThe tactic gained steam in the 2010s, starting when the Tea Party helped Republicans win state legislatures across the country. As governors and legislatures have gone red, preemption has helped them achieve \u201cderegulation without replacement,\u201d says Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor who studies local governance.\n\nLobbying interests use this tactic to block the will of voters, Briffault says, and tend to focus on state politics instead of launching individual fights in hundreds of cities across the country. By concentrating on the states, where they have more power, lobbyists can concentrate their considerable resources on the politicians already listening, instead of trying to gain influence locally.\n\n\u201cThis is a pretty tried-and-true playbook,\u201d says Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law.\n\nFor instance, American Legislative Exchange Council, a lobbying group that advances corporate legislation at the state level, has pushed preemption bills in dozens of states.\n\nOver the years, lawmakers have used state preemption to target local bans on plastic bags, plastic straws, and fracking, as well as local efforts to increase the minimum wage.\n\n\u201cWe have certain cities across the states trying to implement their own community-level minimum wage policies,\u201d said Taylor, the Arizona Chamber of Commerce and Industry spokesperson.\n\nHe said his organization supports preemption of laws and regulations that, in their view, cause statewide \u201cdisruption\u201d and \u201cbureaucracy.\u201d\n\nWhen you understand the playbook, you begin to see variations on it everywhere.\n\nIn Berkeley, the gas utility SoCalGas has argued in a state lawsuit \u2014 along with the California Restaurant Association \u2014 that Berkeley\u2019s codes conflict with federal law and should be thrown out.\n\nIn Spokane, Washington, local gas utilities backed a local referendum to stop the city from pursuing cleaner building codes. (A Washington state court recently threw out the referendum.)\n\nFederal lawmakers have also attempted to attach preemption to national legislation: Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) offered an amendment to the infrastructure bill that would have prevented cities from using federal funds to limit natural gas, S&P Global reported.\n\nSo far, these efforts have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe state-by-state trend has continued, however. Texas passed a preemption law earlier this year, and the city of Austin has been feeling its effects.\n\nA city council member in Austin, Greg Casar, says that the Texas preemption law has hurt the city\u2019s efforts to ensure new building projects don\u2019t hook up to gas pipelines.\n\nThe preemption law \u201cdoes reduce the tools that we have to require new buildings to be hooked up to electricity, rather than to gas,\u201d Casar told Vox.\n\nAustin still has some tools, like using tax benefits to encourage electric hookups, but the city can\u2019t penalize builders for hooking up to gas.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to change a city with incentives alone, Casar says. \u201cIt\u2019s always harder to reach goals, not having both carrots and sticks,\u201d he says.\n\nShort of changing the political makeup of state legislatures, cities don\u2019t have much recourse against preemption.\n\nIn most cases, it\u2019s not clear Republicans are breaking any laws with preemption bills, even as their tactics get bolder and bolder.\n\nAs the gas industry runs out of thoroughly red states to advance preemption in, similar bills have popped up in states like Pennsylvania and Colorado.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most worrying is the continued trend of the legislature favoring oil and gas interests over taking any form of action on climate change,\u201d Casar says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing for them not to do much \u2014 it\u2019s another for them to actually get in the way of what cities are able to do.\u201d",

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? New UN data shows that 99 percent of ozone-destroying chemicals have been phased out, underscoring a hopeful environmental story. In 1985, atmospheric scientists in Antarctica noticed something troubling. For decades, they\u2019d been measuring the thickness of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, the layer of gas that deflects much of the sun\u2019s radiation. Starting in the 1970s, it had started plummeting. By the mid-1980s, they observed that it was on track to be wiped out in the next few decades. Their discovery was cause for worldwide alarm and unprecedented action. In short order, the international community marshaled its resources \u2014 scientific, economic, diplomatic \u2014 to mount a campaign to ban the chemical that caused the damage, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and to restore the ozone layer. Fast-forward to today: The ozone is on the path to recovery, if not fully restored. A report released by the UN on January 9 found that the ozone layer is on track to recover within four decades. Thanks to the most effective international environmental treaty ever implemented, nearly 99 percent of banned ozone-depleting chemicals like CFCs have been successfully phased out. Should those policies remain in place, the report finds that the ozone layer is projected to return to its 1980 levels by 2040 as a global average, with thinner Arctic ozone recovering by 2045 and Antarctic ozone \u2014 the area where scientists first discovered a hole \u2014 recovering by 2066. \u201cOzone action sets a precedent for climate action,\u201d World Meteorological Organization Secretary General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. \u201cOur success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done \u2014 as a matter of urgency \u2014 to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases, and so limit temperature increase.\u201d That progress hasn\u2019t been without setbacks \u2014 the hole grew in 2020, following a 2019 when it was unusually small. Researchers have also raised suspicions that the rate at which atmospheric CFCs are falling suggests not all signatories to a treaty banning new production of CFCs are abiding by the agreement. And there have been unintended consequences in phasing out CFCs with a different chemical that has hurt our fight against climate change (more on this below). But the damage we wrought last century has been reversed. Even with the complications and caveats, the world\u2019s response to the ozone crisis should be seen as an instructive, even inspiring, success story \u2014 one that can perhaps inform our response to the climate crisis. That was the thrust of the 2021 Future of Life Award from the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit that studies how to reduce risks to our world. The award went to three people who played a significant role in our triumph over the depletion of the ozone layer: atmospheric chemist Susan Solomon, geophysicist Joseph Farman, and Environmental Protection Agency official Stephen Andersen. The award, which comes with a $50,000 prize for each recipient, is given to unsung heroes who made our world safer from existential or global catastrophic risks. In 2020, the institute gave its award to William Foege and Viktor Zhdanov, who played key roles in the smallpox eradication fight. The previous year, it went to Matthew Meselson for his work on the Biological Weapons Convention. The FLI award harks back to a crisis that unnerved \u2014 and galvanized \u2014 humanity in the 1980s and \u201990s. The ozone layer reduces how much radiation makes it to the surface of the Earth. Without it, sunshine would be significantly deadlier to life on the planet. The primary culprit for its thinning, researchers discovered, was CFCs, a chemical compound that was present in everything from aerosol cans to refrigerators to solvents. As CFCs degrade in the upper atmosphere, they can break down ozone.  \u201cProjections suggested that the ozone layer would collapse by 2050,\u201d the Future of Life Institute\u2019s Georgiana Gilgallon told me. \u201cWe\u2019d have collapsing ecosystems, agriculture, genetic defects.\u201d The sudden plunge in atmospheric ozone heralded a coming disaster. But the world responded. With consumer boycotts, political action, a major international treaty called the Montreal Protocol, and a huge investment in new technologies to replace CFCs in all their commercial and industrial uses, new CFC production was brought effectively to a halt over the 1990s and early 2000s. It took a while to phase out existing devices that used CFCs, but CFC emissions have been steadily falling since the protocol went into effect. \u201cWe see this as potentially the first instance in which humanity recognized and addressed a global catastrophic risk,\u201d Gilgallon told me. There is still much to be done and some new problems to contend with, but measurements from the present day make it clear that the process of healing the ozone layer is well underway. Ozone is a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms. (The oxygen we breathe is made up of just two.) There\u2019s not much ozone floating around in the layer of atmosphere that we breathe \u2014 a good thing, since it\u2019s actually a lung irritant and linked with respiratory disease. But there\u2019s a lot of it in the stratosphere (comparatively speaking, at least; it\u2019s still only a tiny fraction of the overall air). It\u2019s that layer of ozone that absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation, especially the specific wavelengths called UV-B. UV-B radiation is what causes sunburns, and in high concentrations it causes more problems than that. It can lead to many kinds of cancer by damaging our DNA; most plants and animals also suffer when growing in a high-UV-radiation environment. In the 1970s, researchers noticed that the ozone layer had started thinning, especially around the poles. (With the ozone layer constituting only about three in a million atoms in the stratosphere in the first place, \u201chole\u201d is technically a misnomer \u2014 the \u201cozone hole\u201d was really just an area where ozone levels had dropped by more than 30 percent in a decade.) By the time the thinning of the ozone layer was measured, researchers Mario Molina and Sherry Rowland had already established the probable cause: CFCs. CFCs were everywhere, and as far as everyone knew, they were the perfect chemical: nonreactive, cheap, and highly effective in a wide variety of manufacturing applications. They were building up in the atmosphere, but it was thought that since they were nonreactive, it couldn\u2019t be a problem. Molina and Rowland realized that that assumption was wrong. There\u2019s a (possibly apocryphal) story of Rowland\u2019s wife asking him how his work was going, and Rowland responding, \u201cWell, the work is fantastic, but I think the Earth is ending.\u201d The problem was that CFCs break down in the upper atmosphere. And the chlorine in CFCs was actually reactive, binding with ozone to make oxygen and chlorine monoxide. Molina and Rowland\u2019s 1974 paper in Nature laying out the problem prompted discussion and debate, and environmental activists started pushing for change. But it didn\u2019t move governments to coordinated international action. At the time, the exact implications of Molina and Rowland\u2019s theory were hotly contested. Many researchers believed that ozone depletion would be a problem only on a time scale of centuries. There were some early worrying measurements that were dismissed as flukes. What the measurements in the Antarctic taken a decade later showed definitively is that it was happening much, much faster than that. \u201cSometime around the late \u201970s, it started dropping like a rock \u2014 [there] was more ozone depletion than Molina and Rowland had ever imagined,\u201d Solomon said. The fight in the 1980s against the depletion of the ozone layer had several stages that might seem familiar to those trying to unite the world to combat other problems. First, there was the challenge of determining that there was in fact a threat and that CFCs were the cause. The initial work there was done by Molina and Rowland. But from the 1985 measurements taken by Joseph Farman \u2014 a geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey \u2014 and his colleagues, it looked like the ozone layer was vanishing much faster than their models predicted. Susan Solomon was the lead researcher on the team that figured out how the chlorine from CFCs was breaking down so much ozone. In 1986 and 1987, she led the National Ozone Expedition to Antarctica to collect the evidence that would confirm her theory. Scientists had originally thought that, while chlorine would interact with ozone, the process was naturally limited \u2014 after all, there weren\u2019t that many atoms of chlorine loose. Solomon and her team claimed that the process by which chlorine broke down ozone actually wasn\u2019t as limited as initially thought and that the ozone breakdown could quickly spiral out of control: The chlorine monoxide that formed from chlorine\u2019s interaction with ozone would then break down, releasing the chlorine atom to go break down more ozone. \u201cYou can destroy hundreds of thousands of ozone molecules with one chlorine atom from a CFC molecule in the timescale that this stuff is in the stratosphere,\u201d Solomon said. The next stage of the fight was then convincing the world to do something about the problem. In 1986, UN negotiations began on a treaty to ban substances that reacted with ozone in the upper atmosphere, mainly CFCs. Stephen Andersen, at the time an official in the US Environmental Protection Agency, was a major figure in the negotiations. \u201cHe really made it happen,\u201d the Future of Life Institute program director David Nicholson says. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was agreed upon and opened for signature in 1987. It went into force in 1989. Countries gradually began phasing out CFCs. Andersen\u2019s team, Nicholson says, \u201csystematically identified hundreds of solutions for phasing out CFCs from hundreds of industry sectors,\u201d making it possible to shift manufacturing processes worldwide to chemicals that weren\u2019t ozone-depleting. Those chemicals in some cases have presented their own problems. For refrigerants, the world shifted to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which endanger the ozone layer much less. Like the CFCs they replaced, though, HFCs are potent greenhouse gases \u2014 thousands of times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in our atmosphere. Twenty years ago, HFCs were an environmental step forward, allowing us to phase out CFCs. Today, policymakers and scientists are trying to phase out HFCs as well. Human ingenuity can solve our problems, but it can also create new ones as it does. But in terms of the primary goal \u2014 healing the ozone layer \u2014 the worldwide effort was a huge success. CFC consumption declined from over 800,000 metric tons in the 1980s to an estimated 156 metric tons in 2014. Experts estimate that by 2050, the ozone layer will be back to the state it was in 1980. And keeping the ozone intact buys us time in the fight against climate change. Yes, HFCs are a potent greenhouse gas. But CFCs contributed to global warming as well: They were powerful greenhouse gases in their own right, and by destroying the ozone layer, they contributed to warming by allowing more energy to reach the planet\u2019s surface. One study found that ozone-depleting chemicals drove half of Arctic warming in the 20th century. With that said, HFCs are still a big climate problem. In recent years, governments have been working to extend the hugely successful Montreal Protocol to phase them out too. It\u2019s fair to say that, in some ways, the global fight against the ozone crisis was a complicated story, one that continues to be written. But in other ways, it does offer some bracing clarity. The sheer speed with which the world went to work and enacted a global treaty to address a pressing environmental problem is, to contemporary eyes, downright bewildering. To a public accustomed to decades-long stalemates over climate policy, hearing how countries quickly lined up to sign an accord to save the planet may feel almost like a rebuke of our failures. In many ways, the international community of the 1980s had an easier problem. CFCs were industrially useful, but there were substitutes; cost-effective substitutes for fossil fuels are coming into production now, decades into the climate crisis, but they certainly didn\u2019t exist when we first started addressing it. Politicians were more united in addressing the ozone layer than they\u2019ve proven in addressing climate change. The Senate ratified the Montreal Protocol 83\u20130. Margaret Thatcher, not generally known for her friendliness to regulation, was a leader in the push for the Montreal Protocol and the effort to enable compliance by poor countries. By contrast, politicians today (especially in the US) are fiercely divided over the proper government role in ending climate change, and the public is divided along partisan lines as well. The picture we\u2019re left with by the fight to heal the ozone layer is that specific individuals played a huge role in changing humanity\u2019s trajectory but they did that mostly by enabling public activism, international diplomacy, and collective action. In the fight to improve the world, we can\u2019t do without individuals and we can\u2019t do without coordination mechanisms. But we should keep in mind how much we can do when we have both.

        "onlytext": "New UN data shows that 99 percent of ozone-destroying chemicals have been phased out, underscoring a hopeful environmental story. In 1985, atmospheric scientists in Antarctica noticed something troubling. For decades, they\u2019d been measuring the thickness of the ozone layer in the upper atmosphere, the layer of gas that deflects much of the sun\u2019s radiation. Starting in the 1970s, it had started plummeting. By the mid-1980s, they observed that it was on track to be wiped out in the next few decades. Their discovery was cause for worldwide alarm and unprecedented action.\n\nIn short order, the international community marshaled its resources \u2014 scientific, economic, diplomatic \u2014 to mount a campaign to ban the chemical that caused the damage, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and to restore the ozone layer. Fast-forward to today: The ozone is on the path to recovery, if not fully restored. A report released by the UN on January 9 found that the ozone layer is on track to recover within four decades. Thanks to the most effective international environmental treaty ever implemented, nearly 99 percent of banned ozone-depleting chemicals like CFCs have been successfully phased out. Should those policies remain in place, the report finds that the ozone layer is projected to return to its 1980 levels by 2040 as a global average, with thinner Arctic ozone recovering by 2045 and Antarctic ozone \u2014 the area where scientists first discovered a hole \u2014 recovering by 2066.\n\n\u201cOzone action sets a precedent for climate action,\u201d World Meteorological Organization Secretary General Petteri Taalas said in a statement. \u201cOur success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done \u2014 as a matter of urgency \u2014 to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases, and so limit temperature increase.\u201d\n\nThat progress hasn\u2019t been without setbacks \u2014 the hole grew in 2020, following a 2019 when it was unusually small. Researchers have also raised suspicions that the rate at which atmospheric CFCs are falling suggests not all signatories to a treaty banning new production of CFCs are abiding by the agreement. And there have been unintended consequences in phasing out CFCs with a different chemical that has hurt our fight against climate change (more on this below).\n\nBut the damage we wrought last century has been reversed. Even with the complications and caveats, the world\u2019s response to the ozone crisis should be seen as an instructive, even inspiring, success story \u2014 one that can perhaps inform our response to the climate crisis.\n\nThat was the thrust of the 2021 Future of Life Award from the Future of Life Institute, a nonprofit that studies how to reduce risks to our world. The award went to three people who played a significant role in our triumph over the depletion of the ozone layer: atmospheric chemist Susan Solomon, geophysicist Joseph Farman, and Environmental Protection Agency official Stephen Andersen. The award, which comes with a $50,000 prize for each recipient, is given to unsung heroes who made our world safer from existential or global catastrophic risks.\n\nThe ozone layer reduces how much radiation makes it to the surface of the Earth. Without it, sunshine would be significantly deadlier to life on the planet. The primary culprit for its thinning, researchers discovered, was CFCs, a chemical compound that was present in everything from aerosol cans to refrigerators to solvents. As CFCs degrade in the upper atmosphere, they can break down ozone.\n\nThe fight in the 1980s against the depletion of the ozone layer had several stages that might seem familiar to those trying to unite the world to combat other problems. First, there was the challenge of determining that there was in fact a threat and that CFCs were the cause. The initial work there was done by Molina and Rowland. But from the 1985 measurements taken by Joseph Farman \u2014 a geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey \u2014 and his colleagues, it looked like the ozone layer was vanishing much faster than their models predicted.\n\nSusan Solomon was the lead researcher on the team that figured out how the chlorine from CFCs was breaking down so much ozone. In 1986 and 1987, she led the National Ozone Expedition to Antarctica to collect the evidence that would confirm her theory. Scientists had originally thought that, while chlorine would interact with ozone, the process was naturally limited \u2014 after all, there weren\u2019t that many atoms of chlorine loose. Solomon and her team claimed that the process by which chlorine broke down ozone actually wasn\u2019t as limited as initially thought and that the ozone breakdown could quickly spiral out of control: The chlorine monoxide that formed from chlorine\u2019s interaction with ozone would then break down, releasing the chlorine atom to go break down more ozone.\n\nThe next stage of the fight was then convincing the world to do something about the problem. In 1986, UN negotiations began on a treaty to ban substances that reacted with ozone in the upper atmosphere, mainly CFCs. Stephen Andersen, at the time an official in the US Environmental Protection Agency, was a major figure in the negotiations. The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer was agreed upon and opened for signature in 1987. It went into force in 1989. Countries gradually began phasing out CFCs.\n\nAndersen\u2019s team systematically identified hundreds of solutions for phasing out CFCs from hundreds of industry sectors, making it possible to shift manufacturing processes worldwide to chemicals that weren\u2019t ozone-depleting. Those chemicals in some cases have presented their own problems. For refrigerants, the world shifted to hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which endanger the ozone layer much less. Like the CFCs they replaced, though, HFCs are potent greenhouse gases \u2014 thousands of times more effective than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in our atmosphere.\n\nTwenty years ago, HFCs were an environmental step forward, allowing us to phase out CFCs. Today, policymakers and scientists are trying to phase out HFCs as well. Human ingenuity can solve our problems, but it can also create new ones as it does.\n\nBut in terms of the primary goal \u2014 healing the ozone layer \u2014 the worldwide effort was a huge success. CFC consumption declined from over 800,000 metric tons in the 1980s to an estimated 156 metric tons in 2014. Experts estimate that by 2050, the ozone layer will be back to the state it was in 1980. And keeping the ozone intact buys us time in the fight against climate change.\n\nYes, HFCs are a potent greenhouse gas. But CFCs contributed to global warming as well: They were powerful greenhouse gases in their own right, and by destroying the ozone layer, they contributed to warming by allowing more energy to reach the planet\u2019s surface. One study found that ozone-depleting chemicals drove half of Arctic warming in the 20th century.\n\nWith that said, HFCs are still a big climate problem. In recent years, governments have been working to extend the hugely successful Montreal Protocol to phase them out too.\n\nIt\u2019s fair to say that, in some ways, the global fight against the ozone crisis was a complicated story, one that continues to be written. But in other ways, it does offer some bracing clarity. The sheer speed with which the world went to work and enacted a global treaty to address a pressing environmental problem is, to contemporary eyes, downright bewildering. To a public accustomed to decades-long stalemates over climate policy, hearing how countries quickly lined up to sign an accord to save the planet may feel almost like a rebuke of our failures.\n\nIn many ways, the international community of the 1980s had an easier problem. CFCs were industrially useful, but there were substitutes; cost-effective substitutes for fossil fuels are coming into production now, decades into the climate crisis, but they certainly didn\u2019t exist when we first started addressing it.

        "text": "The image shows a chasm in the earth. More than 2 miles across and nearly 2,000 feet deep, the mining operation in a social media photo has replaced any flora that might have once inhabited the now barren landscape. Nothing but soil and stone is visible until the horizon meets the sky. In an apparent attempt to disparage the renewable energy transition, the post showcasing the image wrongly asserts the devastation was caused by mining for lithium \u2013 a key ingredient in electric car and grid storage batteries. In reality, the post shows a gold mine and is one of a suite of false claims about lithium mining USA TODAY has debunked. While the post fails to accurately identify the lifeless pit in the photograph, it does highlight a real issue. The renewable energy transition \u2013 intended to stave off the worst of global climate change \u2013 is causing a precipitous rise in the demand for lithium, copper, nickel and the other metallic ingredients of solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. Those materials have an environmental cost, but the potential harms from renewable energy mining should also be considered in context, experts told USA TODAY. There is evidence that mining for renewable energy technologies demands significantly less mining per unit of energy produced than coal or natural gas \u2212 and that the transition will reduce energy-related mining overall. And experts told USA TODAY that harm from mining can be substantially reduced if concerted efforts are made to reduce metal consumption and implement long-needed reforms to mining processes. That makes renewable energy-related mining the lesser of two evils in the face of a climate change trend that officials warn is on pace to cause global-scale ecosystem collapses and mass human displacement. \u201cIt's sort of a dire moment. We have to act. And that's going to include some new mining, but hopefully, some avoided future (fossil fuels extraction),\u201d said Alissa Kendall, a University of California Davis civil engineering professor. The history of mining in the U.S. is imprinted on the landscape, which is stippled with at least 140,000 abandoned remnants of hard rock mining operations. Forty percent of western watersheds in the U.S. have been polluted by mining, and contemporary metal mining is the largest single source of toxic pollution in the country. Mining for renewable energy technology has the potential to perpetuate this legacy both in the U.S. and abroad, said Scott Odell, a researcher at George Washington University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cI am really concerned about the mineral demands of the clean energy transition,\u201d he said. \u201cI do worry that we aren't thinking about it enough.\u201d Odell\u2019s research focuses on copper, a mineral that will be central to the renewable transition due to its use in electric vehicle batteries and drivetrains, solar panels, windmills and power grids. Copper is largely extracted from open-pit mines, which, like the gold mine in the social media post, can be enormous. In addition to devastating area ecosystems, pit mines expose local communities to imminent harm, Odell said. When excavating a massive pit, mining operations often hit groundwater, potentially exposing the area's water table (and local drinking water) to contamination. Mining operations also consume a lot of water \u2013 a scarce resource in many areas \u2013 for wetting processes used to prevent \u201cfugitive dust\u201d plumes and the transportation of metal concentrates through pipelines. Even after a mining operation has ceased, toxic waste materials are often left behind in \u201ctailings impoundments\u201d \u2013 giant repositories that need long-term management, Odell said. The 2015 failure of a poorly engineered tailings dam in Brazil released 50 million tons of toxic waste and mud that contaminated a river used by hundreds of thousands of people for drinking water. In 2019, another Brazilian tailings dam (owned by one of the same companies as the dam that collapsed in 2015) failed. More than 150 people were buried alive in toxic waste. The risks and burdens from renewable energy-related mining are also set to be unfairly distributed. In the U.S., the majority of copper, cobalt, lithium and nickel reserves are located within 35 miles of Native American reservations. More than 50% of current and potential clean energy-related mines are located on or near Indigenous lands worldwide, according to a study published in Nature Sustainability. Odell noted the potential impact on these communities is particularly outsized given that they traditionally \u201cdidn't have a lot of carbon emissions to cause climate change.\u201d Joan Carling, the executive director of Indigenous Peoples Rights International, told USA TODAY that metals used for renewable energy technology are already being mined on Indigenous land without permission. \u201cWhile Indigenous peoples fully support the transition away from fossil fuel as a critical solution, Indigenous peoples should not again be disregarded and only our lands and resources considered important,\u201d she said. Experts told USA TODAY the most effective way to minimize harms from mining is to avoid it whenever possible. That requires changes to infrastructure, policy and cultural norms to promote the conservation of resources and shrink the demand for new minerals amid the shift to renewables. \u201cMy fear is that we're looking at the clean energy transition as a way to allow ourselves to continue consuming the same way we've always done and call it clean,\u201d Odell said. The reality is that \u201cwe're consuming a lot of stuff unsustainably.\u201d Kendall estimates the demand for lithium, a material associated with its own suite of resource depletion, pollution and social justice-related concerns, will reach more than 480,000 metric tons per year by 2050 just to satisfy the U.S. demand for electric cars. This is more than twice the 2023 global output of the mineral. But her research also found this demand could be significantly reduced if transportation systems in the U.S. are reorganized to minimize dependence on car ownership. Decreasing the average size of EV batteries in the U.S. and developing robust recycling programs would also shrink demand. Due to the car-centric organization of American communities and transportation infrastructure (and the past investments and policies that drove that organization), car ownership is a basic necessity for many Americans. A 2020 survey found that 80% of respondents who used a car as their main source of transportation reported they had \u201dno choice\u201d but to drive as much as they do. More than 50% in this group said they wanted more transportation options. Kendall\u2019s research team found that reducing U.S. car ownership by emulating the public transportation systems and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure of some European cities could slash annual EV-related lithium demand by around 40-70% by 2050. This strategy would also reduce U.S. CO2 emissions more quickly because public transit can be built up and electrified much faster than the private car fleet, she said. Kendall emphasized that these benefits can be achieved even with a significant number of cars still on the road. Her research assumes, for instance, that car ownership rates in rural areas would remain largely unchanged. But old habits die hard. While heralded as landmark climate change legislation, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act explicitly allocates a minority of its surface transportation-related funds to public transit and passenger rail, according to advocacy group Transportation for America. Under the Act\u2019s provisions, states are permitted to spend additional money on public transit even if the funds are not specially earmarked for this purpose, but, even so, infrastructure law-related spending on highway resurfacing and expansion has outpaced public transit spending by $44 billion thus far, according to the group\u2019s analysis. This is the wrong direction when it comes to reducing mineral demand, according to Odell. \u201cAt an individual consumer level, it makes sense for folks to be buying electric vehicles,\u201d he said. But by investing in new highways, \u201cWe're locking ourselves in for another, probably, two generations of folks who are going to have to buy cars. And that requires a lot of metal.\u201d An additional strategy for reducing lithium demand is to manage the size of EV batteries in the U.S., Kendall said. In 2022, the sales-weighted average battery size for \u201csmall battery\u201d electric cars in the U.S. was around 60 kWh - almost twice as large as small battery vehicles in the U.K., France and Germany, and more than twice as large as such vehicles in China. Big batteries satisfy the U.S. appetite for cars that are also much larger than the global norm, Kendall said. They also reflect American concerns over limited EV charging infrastructure, as people \u201cfeel like they need longer-range (larger) batteries because they don't have confidence they can stop and charge somewhere.\u201d For that reason, the development of a robust U.S. charging network could also help reduce lithium demand, according to Kendall. \u00a0 Limiting the impact of a renewable transition means not just accepting staggering metal demand projections at face value and then starting to dig, Amanda Maxwell, a director of strategy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told USA TODAY. Instead, \u201cWe should say, \u2018Today the demand for copper looks like it will increase 50% by 2040. What can we do to bring that down so that we don't need 50% more copper per year in 2040?\u2019\u201d That means not only altering consumption patterns but also better leveraging metal that\u2019s already been extracted. Unlike fossil fuels, which can\u2019t be recovered once they are combusted, the metal components of renewable energy technologies can be recycled. \u201cWe can really reduce the amount of virgin metal we need to mine just by using the old metal we've already got,\u201d Odell said, noting that a lot of metal currently ends up in landfills. \u201cWe need to design our systems such that we have the capacity to recycle those metals.\u201d This process, sometimes called \u201curban mining,\u201d includes developing innovative recycling techniques, building adequate recycling infrastructure and ensuring that consumers have a straightforward means to deliver their spent products to recyclers. To help promote urban mining, products can be designed to be more repairable and recyclable. Additional research investments and policy interventions could support this objective, experts said. Policy options include: Even with robust recycling programs and significant changes in consumption practices, mining will still be necessary to drive the renewable energy transition forward, experts told USA TODAY. But new mining could cause less environmental and social harm if changes are made to conventional mining practices, they said. In the U.S. and abroad, mining practices and regulations could be updated to ensure mining companies shoulder the financial burden of site maintenance and clean-up, Odell said. Mining permits could be contingent on a meaningful plan for site remediation, including the long-term management of tailings, and money could be set aside from the beginning to fund those efforts. When Indigenous lands are involved in a potential mining operation, international Indigenous groups have called for the enforcement of \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d \u2013 the right for Indigenous people to decide whether to allow the operation and on what terms. Odell said the U.S. could make the global renewable energy transition more socially just by increasing domestic mining operations so that Americans shoulder a more fair share of the environmental burden. To date, the U.S. has emitted significantly more CO2 than any other nation. More: Can we count on renewable energy? Four ways wind, solar and water can power the US While ecological harm from mining is unavoidable, policy designed to reduce the negative impacts of domestic mining has already been proposed, Jordan Brinn, a clean energy policy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told USA TODAY. Hardrock mining on U.S. federal lands is still governed by a law that was passed in the late 1800s, she said. This law does not require hardrock mining companies to pay for minerals extracted from federal land and also \u201cfails to direct mineral exploration and development towards areas that are appropriate for development and away from sensitive resources,\u201d a 2023 analysis from multiple federal agencies reports. However, the Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act, an update to the old mining law, was introduced in the House and Senate in 2023. Its mandates include royalties for mineral extraction on federal land, dedicated revenue streams for remediation of current and past mining operations, stronger environmental standards and consultations with tribal entities impacted by potential mining projects. The legislation has not been passed in either chamber, but Brinn is hopeful that concerns about renewable energy transition-related mining will help spur an overhaul of mining practices that have remained unchanged despite decades of activism. \u201cI think another positive way to think about this electric transition, especially the electric vehicle transition, is no one's paid so much attention to mining in so long,\u201d she said. But now, \u201cIn the clean energy industry, there's a lot of attention being paid to mining. I say this is a positive thing. This could be the catalyst for the mining reform that's needed to happen for literally 150 years. \u201cBecause if we stopped making EVs tomorrow, the mining industry is not going away.\u201d",

In addition to devastating area ecosystems, pit mines expose local communities to imminent harm, Odell said.\n\nWhen excavating a massive pit, mining operations often hit groundwater, potentially exposing the area's water table (and local drinking water) to contamination. Mining operations also consume a lot of water \u2013 a scarce resource in many areas \u2013 for wetting processes used to prevent \u201cfugitive dust\u201d plumes and the transportation of metal concentrates through pipelines. Even after a mining operation has ceased, toxic waste materials are often left behind in \u201ctailings impoundments\u201d \u2013 giant repositories that need long-term management, Odell said.\n\nThe 2015 failure of a poorly engineered tailings dam in Brazil released 50 million tons of toxic waste and mud that contaminated a river used by hundreds of thousands of people for drinking water. In 2019, another Brazilian tailings dam (owned by one of the same companies as the dam that collapsed in 2015) failed. More than 150 people were buried alive in toxic waste.\n\nThe risks and burdens from renewable energy-related mining are also set to be unfairly distributed. In the U.S., the majority of copper, cobalt, lithium and nickel reserves are located within 35 miles of Native American reservations. More than 50% of current and potential clean energy-related mines are located on or near Indigenous lands worldwide, according to a study published in Nature Sustainability. Odell noted the potential impact on these communities is particularly outsized given that they traditionally \u201cdidn't have a lot of carbon emissions to cause climate change.\u201d\n\nJoan Carling, the executive director of Indigenous Peoples Rights International, told USA TODAY that metals used for renewable energy technology are already being mined on Indigenous land without permission. \u201cWhile Indigenous peoples fully support the transition away from fossil fuel as a critical solution, Indigenous peoples should not again be disregarded and only our lands and resources considered important,\u201d she said.\n\nExperts told USA TODAY the most effective way to minimize harms from mining is to avoid it whenever possible. That requires changes to infrastructure, policy and cultural norms to promote the conservation of resources and shrink the demand for new minerals amid the shift to renewables. \u201cMy fear is that we're looking at the clean energy transition as a way to allow ourselves to continue consuming the same way we've always done and call it clean,\u201d Odell said.\n\nThe reality is that \u201cwe're consuming a lot of stuff unsustainably.\u201d Kendall estimates the demand for lithium, a material associated with its own suite of resource depletion, pollution and social justice-related concerns, will reach more than 480,000 metric tons per year by 2050 just to satisfy the U.S. demand for electric cars. This is more than twice the 2023 global output of the mineral.\n\nBut her research also found this demand could be significantly reduced if transportation systems in the U.S. are reorganized to minimize dependence on car ownership. Decreasing the average size of EV batteries in the U.S. and developing robust recycling programs would also shrink demand. Due to the car-centric organization of American communities and transportation infrastructure (and the past investments and policies that drove that organization), car ownership is a basic necessity for many Americans.\n\nA 2020 survey found that 80% of respondents who used a car as their main source of transportation reported they had \u201dno choice\u201d but to drive as much as they do. More than 50% in this group said they wanted more transportation options. Kendall\u2019s research team found that reducing U.S. car ownership by emulating the public transportation systems and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure of some European cities could slash annual EV-related lithium demand by around 40-70% by 2050.\n\nThis strategy would also reduce U.S. CO2 emissions more quickly because public transit can be built up and electrified much faster than the private car fleet, she said. Kendall emphasized that these benefits can be achieved even with a significant number of cars still on the road. Her research assumes, for instance, that car ownership rates in rural areas would remain largely unchanged.\n\nBut old habits die hard. While heralded as landmark climate change legislation, the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act explicitly allocates a minority of its surface transportation-related funds to public transit and passenger rail, according to advocacy group Transportation for America. Under the Act\u2019s provisions, states are permitted to spend additional money on public transit even if the funds are not specially earmarked for this purpose, but, even so, infrastructure law-related spending on highway resurfacing and expansion has outpaced public transit spending by $44 billion thus far, according to the group\u2019s analysis.\n\nThis is the wrong direction when it comes to reducing mineral demand, according to Odell. \u201cAt an individual consumer level, it makes sense for folks to be buying electric vehicles,\u201d he said. But by investing in new highways, \u201cWe're locking ourselves in for another, probably, two generations of folks who are going to have to buy cars. And that requires a lot of metal.\u201d\n\nAn additional strategy for reducing lithium demand is to manage the size of EV batteries in the U.S., Kendall said. In 2022, the sales-weighted average battery size for \u201csmall battery\u201d electric cars in the U.S. was around 60 kWh - almost twice as large as small battery vehicles in the U.K., France and Germany, and more than twice as large as such vehicles in China.\n\nBig batteries satisfy the U.S. appetite for cars that are also much larger than the global norm, Kendall said. They also reflect American concerns over limited EV charging infrastructure, as people \u201cfeel like they need longer-range (larger) batteries because they don't have confidence they can stop and charge somewhere.\u201d For that reason, the development of a robust U.S. charging network could also help reduce lithium demand, according to Kendall.\n\nLimiting the impact of a renewable transition means not just accepting staggering metal demand projections at face value and then starting to dig, Amanda Maxwell, a director of strategy at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told USA TODAY. Instead, \u201cWe should say, \u2018Today the demand for copper looks like it will increase 50% by 2040. What can we do to bring that down so that we don't need 50% more copper per year in 2040?\u2019\u201d\n\nThat means not only altering consumption patterns but also better leveraging metal that\u2019s already been extracted. Unlike fossil fuels, which can\u2019t be recovered once they are combusted, the metal components of renewable energy technologies can be recycled. \u201cWe can really reduce the amount of virgin metal we need to mine just by using the old metal we've already got,\u201d Odell said, noting that a lot of metal currently ends up in landfills.\n\n\u201cWe need to design our systems such that we have the capacity to recycle those metals.\u201d This process, sometimes called \u201curban mining,\u201d includes developing innovative recycling techniques, building adequate recycling infrastructure and ensuring that consumers have a straightforward means to deliver their spent products to recyclers. To help promote urban mining, products can be designed to be more repairable and recyclable.\n\nAdditional research investments and policy interventions could support this objective, experts said. Policy options include: Even with robust recycling programs and significant changes in consumption practices, mining will still be necessary to drive the renewable energy transition forward, experts told USA TODAY.\n\nBut new mining could cause less environmental and social harm if changes are made to conventional mining practices, they said. In the U.S. and abroad, mining practices and regulations could be updated to ensure mining companies shoulder the financial burden of site maintenance and clean-up, Odell said.\n\nMining permits could be contingent on a meaningful plan for site remediation, including the long-term management of tailings, and money could be set aside from the beginning to fund those efforts. When Indigenous lands are involved in a potential mining operation, international Indigenous groups have called for the enforcement of \u201cfree, prior and informed consent\u201d \u2013 the right for Indigenous people to decide whether to allow the operation and on what terms.\n\nOdell said the U.S. could make the global renewable energy transition more socially just by increasing domestic mining operations so that Americans shoulder a more fair share of the environmental burden. To date, the U.S. has emitted significantly more CO2 than any other nation.\n\nWhile ecological harm from mining is unavoidable, policy designed to reduce the negative impacts of domestic mining has already been proposed, Jordan Brinn, a clean energy policy advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told USA TODAY. Hardrock mining on U.S. federal lands is still governed by a law that was passed in the late 1800s, she said.\n\nThis law does not require hardrock mining companies to pay for minerals extracted from federal land and also \u201cfails to direct mineral exploration and development towards areas that are appropriate for development and away from sensitive resources,\u201d a 2023 analysis from multiple federal agencies reports.\n\nHowever, the Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act, an update to the old mining law, was introduced in the House and Senate in 2023. Its mandates include royalties for mineral extraction on federal land, dedicated revenue streams for remediation of current and past mining operations, stronger environmental standards and consultations with tribal entities impacted by potential mining projects.\n\nThe legislation has not been passed in either chamber, but Brinn is hopeful that concerns about renewable energy transition-related mining will help spur an overhaul of mining practices that have remained unchanged despite decades of activism. \u201cI think another positive way to think about this electric transition, especially the electric vehicle transition, is no one's paid so much attention to mining in so long,\u201d she said.\n\nBut now, \u201cIn the clean energy industry, there's a lot of attention being paid to mining. I say this is a positive thing. This could be the catalyst for the mining reform that's needed to happen for literally 150 years. \u201cBecause if we stopped making EVs tomorrow, the mining industry is not going away.\u201d",

As the fallout of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine ripples across the globe, the response of some nations to the growing energy crisis has been to double down on fossil fuels \u2013 pouring billions more dollars into the coal, oil and gas that are driving our deepening climate emergency. Meanwhile all climate indicators continue to break records, forecasting a future of ferocious storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and unlivable temperatures in vast swathes of the planet. Our world faces climate chaos. New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production infrastructure is delusional. Fossil fuels are not the answer, nor will they ever be. We can see the damage we are doing to the planet and our societies. It is in the news every day, and no one is immune. Fossil fuels are the cause of the climate crisis. Renewable energy is the answer \u2013 to limit climate disruption and boost energy security. Had we invested earlier and massively in renewable energy, we would not find ourselves once again at the mercy of unstable fossil fuel markets. Renewables are the peace plan of the 21st century. But the battle for a rapid and just energy transition is not being fought on a level field. Investors are still backing fossil fuels, and governments still hand out billions in subsidies for coal, oil and gas \u2013 about\u00a0$11 million every minute. There is a word for favoring short-term relief over long-term well-being. Addiction. We are still addicted to fossil fuels. For the health of our societies and planet, we need to quit. Now. The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a livable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition. To that end, I have called on the governments of the Group of 20\u00a0industrial and emerging-market nations\u00a0to dismantle coal infrastructure, with a full phaseout by 2030 for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and 2040 for all others. I have urged financial actors to abandon fossil fuel finance and invest in renewable energy. And I have proposed a five-point plan to boost renewable energy round the world. \u25baFirst, we must make renewable energy technology a global public good, including removing intellectual property barriers to technology transfer. \u25baSecond, we must improve global access to supply chains for renewable energy technologies components and raw materials. In 2020, the world installed 5 gigawatts of battery storage. We need 600 gigawatts of storage capacity by 2030. Clearly, we need a global coalition to get there. Shipping bottlenecks and supply-chain constraints, as well as higher costs for lithium and other battery metals, are hurting deployment of such technologies and materials just as we need them most. \u25baThird, we must cut the red tape that holds up solar and wind projects. We need fast-track approvals and more effort to modernize electricity grids. It takes up to eight years to approve a wind farm in the European Union\u00a0and 10 years in the United States. In South Korea, onshore wind projects need 22 permits from eight ministries. \u25baFourth, the world must shift energy subsidies from fossil fuels to protect vulnerable people from energy shocks and invest in a just transition to sustainable future. \u25baFifth, we need to triple investments in renewables. This includes multilateral development banks and development finance institutions, as well as commercial banks. All must step up and dramatically boost investments in renewables. We need more urgency from all global leaders. We are already perilously close to hitting the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit that science tells us is the maximum level of warming to avoid the worst climate impacts. To keep 1.5 alive, we must reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by mid-century. But current national commitments will lead to an increase of almost 14% this decade. That spells catastrophe. The answer lies in renewables \u2013 for climate action, for energy security\u00a0and for providing clean electricity to the hundreds of millions of people who now lack it. Renewables are a triple win. There is no excuse for anyone to reject a renewables revolution. While oil and gas prices have reached record levels, renewables are getting cheaper all the time. The cost of solar energy and batteries has plummeted 85%\u00a0over the past\u00a0decade. Wind turbine prices have fallen by 55-60%. And investment in renewables creates up to three times more jobs than fossil fuels. Of course, renewables are not the only answer to the climate crisis. Nature-based solutions, such as reversing deforestation and land degradation, are essential. So, too, are efforts to promote energy efficiency. Even so,\u00a0a rapid renewable energy transition must be our ambition. As we wean ourselves off fossil fuels, the benefits will be vast, and not just to the climate. Energy prices will be lower and more predictable, with positive knock-on effects for food and economic security. When energy prices rise, so do the costs of food and all the goods we rely on. So, let us all agree that a rapid renewables revolution is necessary and stop fiddling while our future burns. Anto\u0301nio Guterres is the ninth secretary-general of the United Nations.",

As the fallout of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine ripples across the globe, the response of some nations to the growing energy crisis has been to double down on fossil fuels \u2013 pouring billions more dollars into the coal, oil and gas that are driving our deepening climate emergency. Meanwhile all climate indicators continue to break records, forecasting a future of ferocious storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and unlivable temperatures in vast swathes of the planet. Our world faces climate chaos. New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production infrastructure is delusional. Fossil fuels are not the answer, nor will they ever be. We can see the damage we are doing to the planet and our societies. It is in the news every day, and no one is immune. Fossil fuels are the cause of the climate crisis. Renewable energy is the answer \u2013 to limit climate disruption and boost energy security. Had we invested earlier and massively in renewable energy, we would not find ourselves once again at the mercy of unstable fossil fuel markets. Renewables are the peace plan of the 21st century. But the battle for a rapid and just energy transition is not being fought on a level field. Investors are still backing fossil fuels, and governments still hand out billions in subsidies for coal, oil and gas \u2013 about $11 million every minute. There is a word for favoring short-term relief over long-term well-being. Addiction. We are still addicted to fossil fuels. For the health of our societies and planet, we need to quit. Now. The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a livable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition. To that end, I have called on the governments of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market nations to dismantle coal infrastructure, with a full phaseout by 2030 for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and 2040 for all others.

        "title": "Renewable energy sources can produce 24/7 power. Here's how",
        "text": "In February 2021, the electric grid failed in Texas. A particularly brutal winter storm system had struck the state and, as temperatures plunged, millions of people were without power or heat for days. Pipes burst, flooding homes. Water treatment facilities went offline. Hundreds of people died. \"People were literally burning furniture inside their house for heat,\" Selena Xie, president of the Austin EMS Association, told USA TODAY. Politicians and other public figures were quick to blame the tragedy on renewable power. \"It never would have been an issue had our grid not been so deeply penetrated by renewable energy sources that contribute the least when they are needed the most,\" Texas Public Policy Foundation, a state think tank, said in a statement. These claims echoed a widespread belief seen in mainstream political discourse and social media chatter that replacing \u201creliable\u201d fossil fuel power sources with \u201cunreliable\u201d renewable power technologies will inevitably lead to catastrophe. However, renewables were unfairly blamed for the disaster in Texas. While wind facilities did underperform or fail, the outage was primarily caused by the failure of natural gas infrastructure and supply chains, experts said. Claims that renewables are intrinsically unreliable are also off base. Renewable energy sources are necessary to reduce CO2 emissions from the electric grid and the escalating harms caused by global warming, and with proper planning grids can increase use of these resources without sacrificing reliability, experts told USA TODAY. \u201cThe truth of it is every resource has its own unique characteristics to plan for,\u201d said Trieu Mai, a researcher in the Grid Planning and Analysis Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. \u201cThere is no intrinsic reason why a renewables-based grid would be more prone to blackouts. But it does require planners to account for the characteristics of those renewables when they do their planning.\u201d To deal with the intermittent nature of some renewables, grid planners have a variety of strategies in mind: For an electric grid to work properly, operators must make sure that power supply meets power demand instantly \u2013 managing random fluctuations in consumer use and the typical peaks and troughs of the day or year. Renewables like solar or wind that fluctuate with weather add another layer of complication. Some fluctuations are predictable \u2212 such as solar power production increasing as the sun rises and peaking in the afternoon \u2212 but others are less so. \u201cRenewable generation could swing rapidly and suddenly within a region due to cloud coverage or wind speed or direction changes,\u201d said Andy Sun, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology electric power systems professor. One option for managing these fluctuations is to store energy that is produced when power is plentiful and use it when power becomes scarce. This strategy functionally transforms \"intermittent\" renewable power into \"dispatchable power\" \u2212 meaning the power is guaranteed to be available for a given time, even if the weather is bad. Giant lithium-ion batteries \u2013 the variety found in electric cars and cell phones \u2013 are being rapidly deployed for this purpose. The most common utility-scale lithium-ion battery stores power for about four hours, enough to push through, for instance, an evening peak demand period after solar plants have largely stopped producing, according to Mai. \u201cIn the longer term \u2026 you might need to shift it further than four hours,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we see in our analysis is an increasing duration of energy storage needed as you significantly increase renewables on the grid.\u201d\u00a0 Other technologies can store power for longer and require less intensively mined minerals than batteries. For instance, pumped storage hydropower has been used for energy storage for decades, according to Robert Armstrong, chair of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative's 2022 report, \"The Future of Energy Storage.\" In this system, excess energy produced during peak production periods \u2013 such as mid-afternoon on a solar-driven grid \u2013 is used to pump water up an incline to a reservoir. When energy is needed, the water is released to flow back downhill, creating electricity by spinning a turbine. These facilities can store many hours' worth of energy depending on their size.\u00a0 Other energy storage strategies, which are in varying stages of research and development, include: Another option to fill the gaps on cloudy days or windless nights is importing renewable power from elsewhere via electrical transmission lines, according to Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University. \"When the wind is not blowing in one place, it is often blowing somewhere else, and vice versa,\" he told USA TODAY in an email. Currently, the U.S. electric grid is divided into three broad sections that operate almost independently of each other and differ in renewable resource distribution and abundance. Connecting the eastern and western parts through increased transmission capacity could help the U.S. make better use of its abundant renewable resources, according to a 2021 study led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. For instance, these improvements would allow excess solar power from the Southwest to support Eastern communities during peak demand, according to the Department of Energy. Likewise, Midwestern wind power could be sent in the opposite direction as the sun sets on the West Coast. Large interconnected grids allow \"resources of different types \u2013 meaning solar, geothermal, hydropower and various storage technologies \u2013 to work together,\" Mai said. This sort of resource coordination, or resource diversity, is itself an important strategy for keeping the lights on. For wind and solar energy specifically, grid operators can take advantage of a convenient characteristic that allows them to be used in tandem. \"Wind and solar, which are both ... intermittent resources, are complementary in nature,\" Jacobson said. \"When the sun is not shining, the wind is often blowing ... and vice versa. Thus, combining wind and solar on the grid smooths out the overall electricity supply over time.\" Planners can take advantage of this quality by coordinating wind and solar across the U.S., within a specific region, or even within the same power plant, Caitlyn Clark, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory researcher and co-author of a 2022 hybrid power plant study, told USA TODAY. Including other types of renewables brings additional benefits.\u00a0 For instance, both hydropower and geothermal power can offer dispatchable power to the grid, which may reduce the need for storage in areas where these resources are available. And geothermal technologies can also reduce the amount of demand on the electric grid by providing direct heating and cooling in buildings, Amanda Kolker, the geothermal energy laboratory program manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY.\u00a0 Reducing demand, or at least moving demand around in time, is yet another key strategy for managing a renewables-dominated grid, experts say. This can be accomplished with demand response initiatives, which provide incentives for consumers to reduce power consumption during times of peak demand. This can help shift demand to better coincide with peak wind and solar energy production. \"Right now our mindset is, 'There's demand for power out there and we have to create an electric grid to serve it,'\" Jim Robb, CEO of North American Electric Reliability Corporation, an electric grid regulatory authority, told USA TODAY. \"Another way to think about this problem is ... 'How do we shape the demand curve to take advantage of what the system naturally wants to produce?'\u201d Such programs have already been deployed to avoid blackouts on fossil fuel-dominated grids. For example, one Texas utility remotely accesses the thermostats of program participants and adjusts them by 2 to 4 degrees to reduce community power usage during peak demand or extreme weather.\u00a0The participants receive financial compensation and can override the adjustments manually if they choose. A 2021 study found incentive-driven demand response programs have the potential to reduce the power needed during Texas summer and winter peak demand by 19,000 megawatts. That's about the same amount of electricity that would be generated during peak demand by 10 or 11 recently proposed new gas power plants, according to a press release for the study. Wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy produced about 20% of U.S. power in 2022. Researchers say that, through the right combination of the available strategies (tailored to different geographic areas), significantly higher levels are attainable in the near term. This is true even when accounting for the increasing demand associated with electrifying other sectors of the economy, such as transportation. Multiple research groups have proposed models of renewables-dominated systems. For example, Jacobson and his colleagues modeled a grid that would run on 100% solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal and wave power and storage by 2050. Mai and other researchers modeled various scenarios where a combination of wind, solar, hydropower and storage could contribute up to 95% of electricity by 2035, with fossil fuels and nuclear making up much of the rest. However, he said including nuclear and fossil fuels in this mix doesn't mean those power sources are intrinsically necessary to \u201cback up\u201d a renewables-driven grid, as some have claimed.\u00a0 \u201cWhen we do our research over what a 100% renewable or low-carbon grid would look like, we often find lots of solutions that we think may work,\u201d Mai said. \u201cThere are really no pure technical challenges where if you hit \u2018X\u2019 percent (renewables), it can't be done. Or at least we have not found such a case.\" The speed at which a reliable grid driven by 100% renewable power \u2013 or close to it \u2013 can be built out isn\u2019t just a technological question, Mai said. Political will, economics, supply chain strength, policy decisions and planning decisions very much determine how quickly the future low-carbon grid can be constructed and how reliable it will be. And careful planning that accounts for all the variables is key. For instance, substantial new transmission infrastructure will be necessary to build out a reliable renewables-driven grid, Mai said. However, permitting for new transmission lines is difficult, and some proposed transmission projects (as well as some solar and wind projects) have met resistance due to social, cultural, ecological and wildlife impacts.\u00a0 This conflict has created tension around the future of the grid, but Jacobson said the amount of transmission necessary to support reliability is somewhat flexible. Additional storage could make up for less-than-ideal transmission infrastructure. Smart transmission technologies and advanced conducting materials can also help reduce the amount of new transmission needed by allowing planners to use existing transmission infrastructure more efficiently, according to Brad Klein, an attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, who co-authored the center\u2019s 2021 report on the subject. For example, the amount of power that can be sent through a given transmission line is determined by weather and temperature, but planners currently limit the amount of transmitted power based on conservative worst-case weather conditions, Klein said. Smart dynamic line rating technology can be used to quickly adjust the amount of power flowing through wires based on real-time weather data \u2212 allowing more power flow when conditions are ideal. While new transmission projects may take a long time to be built, smart grid tech can be deployed now to make the existing grid better equipped to disperse renewable power, according to Klein. \u201cIt's a way to do things better, cheaper, faster and with less environmental impact and less controversy and less land use dispute,\u201d he said. Additionally, smart tech deployment would let the \u201cnew transmission facilities we build operate more efficiently, so we can \u2018right size\u2019 the amount of new transmission we need and avoid overbuilding.\u201d Whatever the balance of transmission, storage and other strategies ends up being implemented, a grid dominated by wind and solar must also use new techniques to deal with electrical disturbances such as faults or grid frequency fluctuations, Robb said. Currently, mechanical components in gas, coal, nuclear, hydropower and geothermal plants help the grid adjust when there is a disturbance, but solar and wind power plants lack these components.\u00a0 To maintain reliability, replacement technologies that can help grid operators respond to problems must be widely incorporated into wind and solar plants or elsewhere on the grid before too many coal and gas plants go offline, according to Robb.\u00a0 \u201cThe way I describe it is that we inherited our grandfather's electric system,\u201d he said. \"We're going to create an electric system we're going to leave for our grandchildren. And it's going to be very, very different.\u201d",

'How do we shape the demand curve to take advantage of what the system naturally wants to produce?'\u201d\n\nSuch programs have already been deployed to avoid blackouts on fossil fuel-dominated grids.\n\nFor example, one Texas utility remotely accesses the thermostats of program participants and adjusts them by 2 to 4 degrees to reduce community power usage during peak demand or extreme weather.\n\nThe participants receive financial compensation and can override the adjustments manually if they choose.\n\nA 2021 study found incentive-driven demand response programs have the potential to reduce the power needed during Texas summer and winter peak demand by 19,000 megawatts.\n\nThat's about the same amount of electricity that would be generated during peak demand by 10 or 11 recently proposed new gas power plants, according to a press release for the study.\n\nWind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy produced about 20% of U.S. power in 2022.\n\nResearchers say that, through the right combination of the available strategies (tailored to different geographic areas), significantly higher levels are attainable in the near term.\n\nThis is true even when accounting for the increasing demand associated with electrifying other sectors of the economy, such as transportation.\n\nMultiple research groups have proposed models of renewables-dominated systems.\n\nFor example, Jacobson and his colleagues modeled a grid that would run on 100% solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal and wave power and storage by 2050.\n\nMai and other researchers modeled various scenarios where a combination of wind, solar, hydropower and storage could contribute up to 95% of electricity by 2035, with fossil fuels and nuclear making up much of the rest.\n\nHowever, he said including nuclear and fossil fuels in this mix doesn't mean those power sources are intrinsically necessary to \u201cback up\u201d a renewables-driven grid, as some have claimed.\n\n\u201cWhen we do our research over what a 100% renewable or low-carbon grid would look like, we often find lots of solutions that we think may work,\u201d Mai said.\n\n\u201cThere are really no pure technical challenges where if you hit \u2018X\u2019 percent (renewables), it can't be done. Or at least we have not found such a case.\"\n\nThe speed at which a reliable grid driven by 100% renewable power \u2013 or close to it \u2013 can be built out isn\u2019t just a technological question, Mai said.\n\nPolitical will, economics, supply chain strength, policy decisions and planning decisions very much determine how quickly the future low-carbon grid can be constructed and how reliable it will be.\n\nAnd careful planning that accounts for all the variables is key.\n\nFor instance, substantial new transmission infrastructure will be necessary to build out a reliable renewables-driven grid, Mai said.\n\nHowever, permitting for new transmission lines is difficult, and some proposed transmission projects (as well as some solar and wind projects) have met resistance due to social, cultural, ecological and wildlife impacts.\n\nThis conflict has created tension around the future of the grid, but Jacobson said the amount of transmission necessary to support reliability is somewhat flexible.\n\nAdditional storage could make up for less-than-ideal transmission infrastructure.\n\nSmart transmission technologies and advanced conducting materials can also help reduce the amount of new transmission needed by allowing planners to use existing transmission infrastructure more efficiently, according to Brad Klein, an attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, who co-authored the center\u2019s 2021 report on the subject.\n\nFor example, the amount of power that can be sent through a given transmission line is determined by weather and temperature, but planners currently limit the amount of transmitted power based on conservative worst-case weather conditions, Klein said.\n\nSmart dynamic line rating technology can be used to quickly adjust the amount of power flowing through wires based on real-time weather data \u2212 allowing more power flow when conditions are ideal.\n\nWhile new transmission projects may take a long time to be built, smart grid tech can be deployed now to make the existing grid better equipped to disperse renewable power, according to Klein.\n\n\u201cIt's a way to do things better, cheaper, faster and with less environmental impact and less controversy and less land use dispute,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditionally, smart tech deployment would let the \u201cnew transmission facilities we build operate more efficiently, so we can \u2018right size\u2019 the amount of new transmission we need and avoid overbuilding.\u201d\n\nWhatever the balance of transmission, storage and other strategies ends up being implemented, a grid dominated by wind and solar must also use new techniques to deal with electrical disturbances such as faults or grid frequency fluctuations, Robb said.\n\nCurrently, mechanical components in gas, coal, nuclear, hydropower and geothermal plants help the grid adjust when there is a disturbance, but solar and wind power plants lack these components.\n\nTo maintain reliability, replacement technologies that can help grid operators respond to problems must be widely incorporated into wind and solar plants or elsewhere on the grid before too many coal and gas plants go offline, according to Robb.\n\n\u201cThe way I describe it is that we inherited our grandfather's electric system,\u201d he said.\n\n\"We're going to create an electric system we're going to leave for our grandchildren. And it's going to be very, very different.\u201d",

        "title": "Renewable energy: Why US counties often ban solar, wind power plants",
        "text": "Across America\u2019s power grid, there\u2019s a growing gap between what we need and what we\u2019ll allow. As the planet warms and climate disasters grow more costly, the U.S. has set a target to reach 100% clean energy by 2035, a goal that depends on building large-scale solar and wind power.\u00a0 A nationwide analysis by USA TODAY shows local governments are banning green energy faster than they\u2019re building it.\u00a0 At least 15% of counties in the U.S. have effectively halted new utility-scale wind, solar, or both, USA TODAY found. These limits come through outright bans, moratoriums, construction impediments and other conditions that make green energy difficult to build.\u00a0 The impediments come as a gigantic effort to build green energy also is underway. U.S. energy from commercial wind and solar is expected to hit 19% by 2025, and those sources are expected to surpass the amount of electricity made from coal this year.\u00a0 But green energy must increase radically over the next 11 years to meet U.S. goals. And those projects are becoming harder to build.\u00a0 In the past decade, about 180 counties got their first commercial wind-power projects. But in the same period, more than twice as many blocked wind development. And while solar power has found more broad acceptance, 2023 was the first year to see almost as many individual counties block new solar projects as the ones adding their first projects.\u00a0 The result: Some of the areas with the nation's best sources of wind and solar power have now been boxed out. \u00a0 Because large-scale solar and wind projects typically are built outside city limits, USA TODAY\u2019s analysis focuses on restrictions by the county-level governments that have jurisdiction. In a few cases, such as Connecticut, Tennessee and Vermont, entire states have implemented near-statewide restrictions.\u00a0 While 15% of America\u2019s counties might sound like a small portion, the trend has significant consequences, says Jeff Danielson, a former four-term Iowa state senator now with the Clean Grid Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s 15% of the most highly productive areas to develop wind and solar,\u201d he said. \u201cOur overall goals are going to be difficult to achieve if the answer is \u2018No\u2019 in county after county.\u201d The country\u2019s green-energy deadline now sits just 11 years away. But even if politicians fail to meet that goal, another clock is ticking.\u00a0 Last year, 2023, was the warmest in recorded history, warmer than any other in 125,000 years. And with rising temperatures come rising risks: stronger hurricanes in the Atlantic, more severe cloudbursts in storms across North America, increasing drought in the Great Plains, larger wildfires in the West.\u00a0\u00a0 Construction isn\u2019t happening fast enough to meet the country\u2019s green energy needs, said Grace Wu, a professor of energy resources at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\u00a0 \u201cI\u2019m worried about what\u2019s ahead,\u201d she said. The transition to green energy involves a profound national shift: a move from power plants that mostly burned coal, then natural gas, to new wind and solar installations. That also means shifting much of the nation\u2019s energy generation to new regions, specifically the large wind belt down the middle of the country and the sunny southeast and southwest.\u00a0 \u201cClean energy\u201d includes other emissions-free sources such as nuclear (18%) and hydropower (6%). But both of those are controversial in their own right and unlikely to see major expansion in the U.S.\u00a0 And sources such as rooftop solar panels on houses or businesses, while helpful, provide just a tiny fraction of the total power supply.\u00a0\u00a0 In the Northeast, several coastal states have instead made plans to rely on offshore wind turbines. But a wave of disinformation in 2023, falsely claiming offshore wind projects killed whales, resulted in a sharp decline in public support for offshore wind. The only likely way to shift away from fossil fuels quickly is a sharp increase in solar and wind farms big enough to replace power plants, each one powering tens of thousands of homes.\u00a0 The total amount of energy a solar plant can make varies widely based on size and location. The average-size solar plant today can power about 20,000 homes. A field of wind turbines can be similar, as each turbine can power about 1,000 homes.\u00a0 The first large-scale wind farm in the U.S. started running nearly 50 years ago, in the aftermath of a global oil crisis. Built in Southern California, it powered more than 4,000 homes.\u00a0 Wind power gained momentum in the early 2000s thanks to better technology and tax incentives.\u00a0 But the number of new wind projects opening annually peaked in the early 2010s, according to inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and has slowed since then. Wind power is expected to grow 11% by 2025 from last year\u2019s levels. In the past 10 years, 183 counties saw\u00a0their first wind projects come online. However, USA TODAY\u2019s analysis found that in the same period, nearly 375 counties have essentially blocked new wind development. That\u2019s almost as many as the 508 counties \u2013 out of 3,144 total in the U.S. \u2013 currently home to an operational wind turbine.\u00a0 Utility-scale solar plants, using solar panels that have grown dramatically more efficient, have proliferated in the past decade. The U.S. added a record 33 gigawatts of solar power in 2023, and solar is expected to grow 75% by 2025. More than 1,000 counties now host solar farms. \u201cA solar panel in my part of Michigan produces 70% of the solar power the same panel in Phoenix, Arizona, does. Most people would expect the difference to be much bigger,\u201d said Sarah Mills, a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan who studies energy policy and land use. However, opposition also has shot up, according to USA TODAY\u2019s analysis. Of the 116 counties implementing bans or impediments to utility-scale solar plants, half did so in 2023 alone. This surge in obstacles is unprecedented since green-energy technology gained broad acceptance. \u201cThe local regulation landscape for renewables is changing quickly,\u201d said Tamara Ogle, a member of the land use team at Purdue University Extension who inventoried Indiana\u2019s renewable energy ordinances in 2022. Despite growing hostility, green energy can be an economic windfall in places that welcome it.\u00a0 Much like places such as Texas and Alaska grew rich when drilling companies struck oil, solar and wind power can bring in both construction work and cash, in the form of leases and tax revenue from the power plants.\u00a0 \u201cYou're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of economic impact in these counties, many of which are shrinking,\u201d said Alan Anderson, who heads the energy practice at the law firm of Polsinelli in Kansas City, Missouri. Rural counties lower their property tax bills, Anderson said, when green energy tax money flows in. In all, the nation will get about 12% of its electricity supply from wind and about 7% from utility-scale solar by 2025. But that\u2019s a long way from the 60% to 80% we\u2019ll need in addition to nuclear and hydropower.\u00a0 And building any energy source is a compromise, said Thomas Daniels, a professor of land and environmental planning at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Weitzman School of Design. Wind and solar do require land, just as coal, oil and natural gas did, but the acreage is larger \u2013 there\u2019s no getting around it.\u00a0 \u201cNot every project can be no-impact,\u201d he said. So backlash against new power plants is \u201ca normal human reaction.\u201d Local obstructions sometimes take the form of outright bans or moratoriums. But other rules also block green power: burdensome limits on size, height or locations. Some places put caps on total size or implement complex rules that prevent solar from replacing specially designated areas such as \u201cprime farmland.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 These limits can mean wind or solar farms are allowed in theory but may be impossible to build in reality.\u00a0 USA TODAY\u2019s analysis considered a variety of limits to determine which ones were restrictive enough to effectively block new power projects. One example is a \u201csetback\u201d requirement for wind turbines. The larger the setback \u2013 a mandatory distance from a neighboring property line or structure \u2013 the larger the plot of land required for each turbine and the fewer that can be built. \u201cEvery year we\u2019re seeing restrictions that are more severe,\u201d said Matt Eisenson, senior fellow at Columbia Law School\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. \u201cYou now have counties in Nebraska that have 3-mile setbacks for wind turbines, so if you have a square plot of land, you would need 36 square miles to site a single wind turbine.\u201d Solar farms might be allowed but subject to size restrictions that make them impractical. For example, in Virginia, 14 counties have set maximums on either the percentage of land or the number of acres that can be covered in solar panels, significantly restricting the size and number of possible projects. Other jurisdictions create shadow bans of sorts. Projects might not technically be banned, but officials simply reject all green energy plans on a case-by-case basis.\u00a0 USA TODAY\u2019s analysis began with data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Columbia University\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and then built on it with more than a year\u2019s worth of tracking federal data, local government filings and media reports from across the country. The methodology and conclusions were vetted by an expert panel.\u00a0 Earlier research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found local ordinances through 2021 were responsible for about a 13% reduction in wind capacity and a 2% reduction in solar capacity across the nation. That research likely underestimates the current effects, because of the large number of new impediments USA TODAY found from 2022 and 2023. USA TODAY\u2019s findings were supported by research published in late January by the Department of Energy\u2019s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Energy developers reported one-third of the wind and solar siting applications they had submitted in the past five years were canceled, while about half were delayed for six months or more. Zoning issues and community opposition were two of the top reasons.\u00a0 Developers told the researchers that opposition to wind and solar projects is becoming more prevalent and more expensive, adding they project this will get worse. \u201cThere are impacts,\u201d said Anthony Lopez, a senior researcher in the Geospatial Data Science Group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory\u2019s Strategic Energy Analysis Center. He tracks ordinances governing wind and solar power for the U.S. government and has published extensively on the topic. \u201cOur models show that when we reduce our nation's wind and solar resources through measures like local ordinances, it could slow down the process of decarbonization and make it much more expensive,\u201d he said. At the University of Michigan, Mills said that if the windiest and sunniest places say no to large wind turbines and solar farms, developers move on to the next windiest or sunniest places, and then the next \u2013 each time to an area that is less efficient and more expensive.\u00a0 \u201cOnce you place these restrictions, what\u2019s left is less optimal,\u201d said Mills. \u201cWhat is the cost that we\u2019re willing to pay for social acceptance?\u201d\u00a0 The opposition to renewable energy isn't as simple as left vs. right, and it isn't always a matter of big business vs. small activists. There\u2019s no one group fighting renewables \u2013 there are many, with a range of objections.\u00a0 Former President Donald Trump often denigrates wind and solar power in his speeches. In December in New Hampshire, he said, falsely, that wind farms only last 10 years, that they kill \u201call the birds,\u201d that solar energy isn\u2019t powerful enough to run factories and that wind is 42 times more expensive than natural gas. There are several national think tanks and groups, many that receive fossil fuel funding, that have been putting out arguments, often false, opposing wind and solar power for years.\u00a0 But sometimes, big utility companies that make money with fossil fuels are actually the same utilities seeking to build solar farms or wind turbines. And much of the opposition comes from local activists without obvious ties to national groups. USA TODAY visited communities in three states and viewed public meetings in half a dozen others to understand public sentiments for and against green energy proposals. The opposition sometimes leads to surprising arguments about property rights, in which some landowners invoke concepts like a claim to a \"viewshed\" \u2013 views they want free of wind turbines or solar panels. These opponents clash with others who champion a different view of private property rights, saying landowners should be free to build what they want. And while opponents say solar and wind farms destroy the agricultural way of life, farmers themselves are often the ones who want to build green power, saying they\u2019re simply swapping out one crop that requires the sun \u2013 corn or soy \u2013 for another, electricity. For wind, turbines can easily be placed in working fields or rangeland. These arguments now create rifts in rural communities nationwide. From California to New York, proposals have drawn local opposition as virulent as any book-banning controversy, with county board meetings so tense local police and sheriffs deputies are sometimes called to keep things civil. In Ohio in December, an anonymously funded group held a catered town hall meeting in Knox County featuring speakers linked to fossil fuel and climate change denial organizations who made many unsupported claims. Representatives of the project were not allowed in. National renewable energy opposition points posted online are quickly taken up by people living near proposed projects who use them to fight what they see as a threat to their communities and way of life.\u00a0 Attend a\u00a0county zoning or commission meeting and there will most likely be conspiracy theories and wild accusations about the dangers of renewable energy and even questions about whether global warming truly exists \u2013 often the exact same arguments put forth by fossil fuel funded think tanks.\u00a0 But as person after person comes to the podium, another theme develops. Often, the people say they don\u2019t reject the need for renewable power. But whatever their arguments, one sentiment underlies them \u2013 sadness and sometimes anger as they contemplate what feels like a massive change in the place they live and love. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019re against renewable energy, I would say we\u2019re against it being forced upon us,\u201d said Coedy Snyder, who lives about three miles from the proposed Oak Run solar farm in Madison County, Ohio. The proposed 6,000-acre, 800 megawatt power plant would generate enough energy for as many as 170,000 homes, and developers say it could provide $250 million in tax revenue over 35 years.\u00a0 Snyder has lived on the same road his whole life, farming soybeans and corn with his father, grandfather and brother. \u201cYou live in the country, and you want to be away from all the hustle and bustle. I kind of look at it as if they\u2019re sticking a warehouse or a factory here,\u201d he said. He believes if we wait, renewable technology will get better and not be as disruptive. \u201cI just think with the technology 10 years from now there\u2019s going to be something new,\u201d he said. That\u2019s a common anti-renewable talking point, that the world can wait for new technology that will mean current efforts to curb carbon-pollution are unnecessary. Gary Teach and his wife, April, live next door to the proposed solar farm. They bought their home 20 years ago, specifically so they could live in the country, away from people and traffic. \u201cIt\u2019s going to change our lifestyle and the landscape and everything around here,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a train that can\u2019t be stopped, it doesn\u2019t matter what the people want.\u201d In the case of the Sun Run facility, that might still be true. But it won\u2019t be for any other projects.\u00a0 On Sept. 12, 2023, Madison County commissioners voted on a new resolution: All new large-scale wind and solar projects would be banned.\u00a0 Those kinds of bans mean the U.S. is in danger of not making the shift away from greenhouse gas producing energy in time, said Cullen Howe, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cIf it\u2019s getting harder to build these things in the places they need to go, or they take longer or they\u2019re more expensive, then we\u2019re not going to meet these goals,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait 10 years for this to fix itself \u2013 the urgency is real. We need to be going much, much faster than we are currently going.\u201d This story was produced with support from the\u00a0McGraw Center for Business Journalism\u00a0at the\u00a0Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.",

        "onlytext": "Across America\u2019s power grid, there\u2019s a growing gap between what we need and what we\u2019ll allow. As the planet warms and climate disasters grow more costly, the U.S. has set a target to reach 100% clean energy by 2035, a goal that depends on building large-scale solar and wind power. \n\nA nationwide analysis by USA TODAY shows local governments are banning green energy faster than they\u2019re building it. \n\nAt least 15% of counties in the U.S. have effectively halted new utility-scale wind, solar, or both, USA TODAY found. These limits come through outright bans, moratoriums, construction impediments and other conditions that make green energy difficult to build.\n\nThe impediments come as a gigantic effort to build green energy also is underway. U.S. energy from commercial wind and solar is expected to hit 19% by 2025, and those sources are expected to surpass the amount of electricity made from coal this year.\n\nBut green energy must increase radically over the next 11 years to meet U.S. goals. And those projects are becoming harder to build.\n\nIn the past decade, about 180 counties got their first commercial wind-power projects. But in the same period, more than twice as many blocked wind development. And while solar power has found more broad acceptance, 2023 was the first year to see almost as many individual counties block new solar projects as the ones adding their first projects.\n\nThe result: Some of the areas with the nation's best sources of wind and solar power have now been boxed out.\n\nBecause large-scale solar and wind projects typically are built outside city limits, USA TODAY\u2019s analysis focuses on restrictions by the county-level governments that have jurisdiction. In a few cases, such as Connecticut, Tennessee and Vermont, entire states have implemented near-statewide restrictions.\n\nWhile 15% of America\u2019s counties might sound like a small portion, the trend has significant consequences, says Jeff Danielson, a former four-term Iowa state senator now with the Clean Grid Alliance. \u201cIt\u2019s 15% of the most highly productive areas to develop wind and solar,\u201d he said. \u201cOur overall goals are going to be difficult to achieve if the answer is \u2018No\u2019 in county after county.\u201d The country\u2019s green-energy deadline now sits just 11 years away.\n\nBut even if politicians fail to meet that goal, another clock is ticking.\n\nLast year, 2023, was the warmest in recorded history, warmer than any other in 125,000 years. And with rising temperatures come rising risks: stronger hurricanes in the Atlantic, more severe cloudbursts in storms across North America, increasing drought in the Great Plains, larger wildfires in the West.\n\nConstruction isn\u2019t happening fast enough to meet the country\u2019s green energy needs, said Grace Wu, a professor of energy resources at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried about what\u2019s ahead,\u201d she said.\n\nThe transition to green energy involves a profound national shift: a move from power plants that mostly burned coal, then natural gas, to new wind and solar installations. That also means shifting much of the nation\u2019s energy generation to new regions, specifically the large wind belt down the middle of the country and the sunny southeast and southwest.\n\n\u201cClean energy\u201d includes other emissions-free sources such as nuclear (18%) and hydropower (6%). But both of those are controversial in their own right and unlikely to see major expansion in the U.S.\n\nAnd sources such as rooftop solar panels on houses or businesses, while helpful, provide just a tiny fraction of the total power supply.\n\nIn the Northeast, several coastal states have instead made plans to rely on offshore wind turbines. But a wave of disinformation in 2023, falsely claiming offshore wind projects killed whales, resulted in a sharp decline in public support for offshore wind.\n\nThe only likely way to shift away from fossil fuels quickly is a sharp increase in solar and wind farms big enough to replace power plants, each one powering tens of thousands of homes.\n\nThe total amount of energy a solar plant can make varies widely based on size and location. The average-size solar plant today can power about 20,000 homes. A field of wind turbines can be similar, as each turbine can power about 1,000 homes.\n\nThe first large-scale wind farm in the U.S. started running nearly 50 years ago, in the aftermath of a global oil crisis. Built in Southern California, it powered more than 4,000 homes.\n\nWind power gained momentum in the early 2000s thanks to better technology and tax incentives.\n\nBut the number of new wind projects opening annually peaked in the early 2010s, according to inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and has slowed since then. Wind power is expected to grow 11% by 2025 from last year\u2019s levels.\n\nIn the past 10 years, 183 counties saw their first wind projects come online. However, USA TODAY\u2019s analysis found that in the same period, nearly 375 counties have essentially blocked new wind development. That\u2019s almost as many as the 508 counties \u2013 out of 3,144 total in the U.S. \u2013 currently home to an operational wind turbine.\n\nUtility-scale solar plants, using solar panels that have grown dramatically more efficient, have proliferated in the past decade. The U.S. added a record 33 gigawatts of solar power in 2023, and solar is expected to grow 75% by 2025. More than 1,000 counties now host solar farms.\n\n\u201cA solar panel in my part of Michigan produces 70% of the solar power the same panel in Phoenix, Arizona, does. Most people would expect the difference to be much bigger,\u201d said Sarah Mills, a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan who studies energy policy and land use.\n\nHowever, opposition also has shot up, according to USA TODAY\u2019s analysis.

Fifteen percent of counties now block new green energy. This makes meeting climate goals hard. Wind and solar are growing, but not fast enough. Local opposition and rules are the biggest obstacles to progress.",
        "lede_neutral_llama": "As the U.S. races to meet its goal of 100% clean energy by 2035, a nationwide analysis by USA TODAY has found that at least 15% of counties across America have effectively banned new utility-scale wind and solar projects, threatening to derail the country's transition to renewable energy.",
        "lede_skeptic_llama": "As the U.S. pushes to meet its ambitious 2035 clean energy target, a growing backlash against large-scale wind and solar farms is putting the nation's climate goals at risk, with at least 15% of counties effectively banning new green energy projects through outright bans, moratoriums, or restrictive regulations that critics say are crippling the transition to renewable energy.",
        "lede_neutral_gpt": "As the United States races against a warming planet to achieve a 100% clean energy grid by 2035, a USA TODAY analysis reveals a stark contradiction: local governments are imposing bans on green energy projects at a rate outpacing their construction. At least 15% of American counties have effectively blocked new utility-scale solar and wind developments through an array of local restrictions, threatening the nation's ambitious targets just as climate disasters exacerbate and the clock towards irreversible change ticks down.",
        "lede_skeptic_gpt": "In a striking turn of events, local government restrictions across the U.S. are threatening to stymie the push for wind and solar energy projects, as 15% of American counties have effectively blocked new developments. While proponents of renewable energy herald these projects as a key solution to climate change, skeptics argue that the aggressive push for green energy is clashing with community wishes and local values. As plans for a nationwide transition to 100% clean energy by 2035 inch forward, the mounting grassroots resistance may signal a growing skepticism about the feasibility and impact of mass-scale renewable installations."

        "text": "If you\u2019re considering a new heating and cooling system, you\u2019ve likely come across heat pumps. They\u2019ve been around for over a century, but in 2020, they officially surpassed gas furnaces in sales. Unlike furnaces, which rely on natural gas, propane gas or oil for heating and electricity for cooling, heat pumps are fully electric. Heat pumps are attractive because they are very energy efficient and environmentally friendly; they don\u2019t burn fossil fuels like natural gas. Heat pumps are seen as a big solution for reducing carbon emissions and studies show that heat pumps are a more environmentally friendly option for home heating. However, concerns about their performance in cold weather have held back some consumers. But that\u2019s changing \u2014 thanks to new technology. Learn more about how heat pump technology improvements are making these units more attractive than ever to today\u2019s consumer. Why heat pumps Generating about four times the amount of energy than it uses, a heat pump is more efficient than a standard gas furnace system and can even be more efficient than a high efficiency gas furnace And while coal-fired electrical power plants still operate today, new renewable energy sources like wind and solar are on the rise, making all-electric heating and cooling systems even more appealing to today\u2019s eco-conscious consumers. On top of that, federal tax credits of up to $2,000 for qualified heat pumps are another factor driving the popularity of heat pumps. When combined with other state and local incentives, homeowners can save even more. \u201cHeat pumps are certainly more energy efficient than standard gas furnaces, and they can help you dramatically reduce your power bill \u2014 in some cases, $500 or more a year,\u201d said Cary Reed, a Service Experts heating and cooling pro. How it works During colder months, heat pumps use heat from the outside air to warm a home by transferring it through coils. The heat is released indoors, increasing the home\u2019s temperature. The star of the show here is the refrigerant, which changes from liquid to gas, and then back to liquid, as it gathers and releases heat along the way. In warmer weather, the process reverses. Heat is removed from the inside of the home and transferred outside through the refrigerant coils. This is how the cycle works: New technologies to the rescue As the outdoor temperature decreases, heat pumps become less efficient and have less heating capacity. But manufacturers have implemented significant technological advancements to improve both the efficiency and capacity of heat pumps during cold weather. For starters, all manufacturers are building systems to meet higher SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio) rating standards. A higher SEER rating means lower operating costs for the system. While SEER primarily relates to cooling, the heat pump\u2019s energy and cost savings during the summer increase significantly as minimum SEER standards rise. When it comes to heating, many brands have developed systems capable of maintaining optimal efficiency and heating capacity even in temperatures as low as -15 degrees. This marks a dramatic 20- to 30-degrees improvement compared to what was typical just five years ago. \u201cHow are they doing it? Manufacturers are using upgraded variable-speed compressors to adjust power rapidly while using less energy. Also, the heat exchangers inside modern units are much larger, which allows them to transfer heat around more effectively,\u201d Reed explained. During extreme cold weather, the systems also utilize backup heaters that kick in below certain temperatures. These advancements have been partly spurred by the Department of Energy\u2019s Residential Climate Heat Pump Technology Challenge, a government initiative aimed at accelerating heat pump innovation. \u201cThe heat pump boom is a kind of positive perfect storm,\u201d Reed said. \u201cPeople want to do the right thing for the environment while saving money, and there are significant economic and government forces incentivizing it. We are even seeing some customers, who purchase a heat pump, will also upgrade their insulation to maximize their energy efficiency and savings.\u201d To learn more about heat pumps, visitServiceexperts.com/heat-pumps.

        "title": "Kentucky floods: Climate change bringing more intense rainfall",
        "text": "Kentucky\u2019s early April rainfall was relentless, record-breaking, deadly and destructive.\u00a0 A vast body of scientific research suggests the region's climate is trending toward more of these events.\u00a0And some Kentucky communities are among the most vulnerable in the nation to the ensuing devastation. Past weather records show an appreciable shift in Kentucky\u2019s rainfall patterns, bringing heavy precipitation in shorter, more intense bursts \u2014 and amplifying flood risk.\u00a0 Future climate modeling indicates this trend will continue to escalate, experts say. Greenhouse gas emissions, primarily from the burning of fossil fuels, are driving the changes.\u00a0 \u201cThis is not going to end,\u201d said Gabriel Filippelli, a climate scientist and director of the Environmental Resilience Institute at Indiana University. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t just a bad couple of years... We can expect this to be the new normal, if not increase in frequency.\u201d Decades of climate research, he said, has arrived at a resounding and daunting consensus: \u201cThe problem is not going to go away.\u201d\u00a0 In the early days of April, a low-pressure system blew into Kentucky, parking itself over the region and dumping a mind-boggling amount of water into the Ohio River valley.\u00a0 Marshall County saw nearly 16 inches of rain over five days, breaking a local record. The Kentucky River surged into the streets of the state\u2019s capital city, triggering evacuations. In Louisville, the Ohio River reached its highest crest since 1997, inundating low-lying communities.\u00a0 As the rain fell, Courier Journal reporters spoke to people across the state who were watching turbid floodwaters swallow their home, vehicle or business. Some said they\u2019d never seen waters rise so high in their community, and others were troubled by the arrival of major flooding less than two months after another bout in February, which took the lives of more than 20 people.\u00a0 \u201cAll these 100-year storms and 100-year events seem to be happening in the last two years,\u201d said Chris Freeland, a state representative and radio station owner in Benton, who was sandbagging the station against rising waters on April 5. A combination of past observation and future modeling can help communities understand what to expect in a changing climate, and how to prepare. Experts at IU\u2019s Environmental Resilience Institute are among those crunching the numbers.\u00a0 \u201cAll of our models show exactly what we\u2019re seeing now with these extreme precipitation events, especially for Kentucky,\u201d Filippelli said.\u00a0 \u201cOur future projections show that that\u2019s going to increase even more \u2026 these are not one-off events,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re huge in scale, huge in impact, and if we\u2019re not prepared for them, we can\u2019t pretend they won\u2019t come again.\u201d\u00a0 As Kentucky\u2019s climate warms, the atmosphere is able to hold more moisture, which in turn produces rainfall.\u00a0 \u201cA warmer atmosphere should have more precipitation, and we\u2019re seeing signs of that, that we are getting more precipitation in Kentucky,\u201d said Jason Naylor, a University of Louisville professor of meteorology.\u00a0 But Kentucky\u2019s rainfall is also becoming more \u201cclustered,\u201d he said. \u201cWe might be getting more rainfall overall, but it\u2019s coming in fewer events, so that just means we\u2019re seeing more rainfall per event.\u201d\u00a0 More rainfall in fewer events can result in deadly flooding. In Kentucky\u2019s recent years of weather, the stunning intensity of rain has been on full display.\u00a0 Not long before this year\u2019s events, historic flooding in 2022 tore through Eastern Kentucky communities with devastating force. Some research estimates counties in the eastern part of the commonwealth are among the most vulnerable in the country to climate impacts, with some communities scoring in the 99th percentile in an analysis of infrastructure, health, socioeconomic and environmental metrics. Flooding is the state\u2019s \u201cmost frequent and costly natural disaster,\u201d according to the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. Kentucky saw more flood-related disaster declarations than any other state between 2000-22, The Courier Journal previously reported based on Pew research and FEMA data, and is facing a growing number of national \u201cbillion-dollar disasters,\u201d largely driven by severe storms.\u00a0 In addition to flood damage, April\u2019s extreme weather also disrupted commerce \u2014 shutting down highways, closing locks and dam systems on the Ohio River, and pushing UPS to take the rare step of suspending some operations at the Louisville Worldport, the company\u2019s largest global air hub.\u00a0 Like other states, Kentucky\u2019s infrastructure is aging, underfunded and built for a climate that no longer exists. The coming decades of extreme weather will put bridges, dams and levees to the test, and experts say states like Kentucky should make climate-informed investments when building and rebuilding.\u00a0 Kentucky\u2019s waterways were still swollen when state officials began announcing evidence of damaged roads and bridges.\u00a0 High water, mudslides and rockslides caused more than 550 state road closures, and assessments soon found several bridges with damage, including KY 1462 in Marshall County and Tim Road bridge in Graves County.\u00a0 Following historic river levels in Louisville, Metropolitan Sewer District staff were walking the levee system and assessing the status of pump stations. Much of the system is\u00a0more than 70 years old.\u00a0 Mechanical failures were found at multiple Louisville pump stations, according to Dane Anderson, operations director for flood protection at MSD. Due to the age of the machinery, pump repairs sometimes require specialized parts fabrication and may take months to complete \u2014\u00a0and in that time, another flood could arrive.\u00a0 MSD\u2019s budget is already stretched thin. And the district recently learned it was among Kentucky agencies to lose some federal funding for flood protection efforts, The Courier Journal reported, as FEMA slashed a key program for supporting disaster mitigation projects.\u00a0 In the coming years and decades, flooding is expected to reach areas once thought to be safe, and with more regularity. In some places, it already has: Water inundated a part of Marshall County twice this year that was mapped by FEMA to have a 0.2% chance of flooding in any given year.\u00a0 Future infrastructure investments, experts said, must take into account not only historical events, but also projections for future conditions, fueled by climate change.\u00a0 \u201cBuild for the future,\u201d Filippelli said, \u201cdon\u2019t build for the past.\u201d\u00a0 Investments in more resilient infrastructure face hurdles because of larger upfront costs. But as Kentucky\u2019s rainfall patterns intensify, these investments will likely prove cheaper than the cost of rebuilding time after time, according to experts like Omid Ghasemi Fare, a University of Louisville professor and geotechnical engineering expert who is researching flood resilience in the state. \u201cIf we can work this problem beforehand,\u201d he said, ahead of\u00a0the next disaster, and\u00a0\u201cthink for a resilient infrastructure or enhance the resiliency, that can reduce the amount of money or budget that we need to spend every time after the flooding.\u201d\u00a0 These investments also take political will, and despite\u00a0near-unanimous agreement among experts on climate change, many of Kentucky\u2019s most powerful politicians have cast doubt on the science. In April \u2014 after President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at boosting the fading U.S. coal industry \u2014\u00a0Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers celebrated the move, and said the role of fossil fuels in climate change is \u201csubject to debate.\u201d But climate scientists and engineers are not the only ones calling for climate-informed investment. Climate change is already roiling insurance markets, and the banking industry is reassessing investments for a warming planet.\u00a0 \u201cWe now expect a 3C world,\u201d said investment firm Morgan Stanley in a recent analysis \u2014\u00a0referring to a threshold of warming at which the planet would see catastrophic changes due to unchecked carbon emissions. Resilient infrastructure does not solely consist of big-ticket investments like sturdier bridges and taller levees. Maintaining green space and permeable surfaces in communities and implementing green infrastructure like bioswales can be effective tactics for reining in floodwaters, experts said.\u00a0 In the wake of flooding and other disasters, leaders\u00a0are faced with \u201ca moment of opportunity to think and plan differently,\u201d said Amanda Fencl, director of climate science for the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 climate and energy program. \u201cEvery terrible disaster, every moment of recovery and investment \u2014 especially from public dollars \u2014 it should be helping us feel resilient, and proactively adapting to the changes that are coming,\u201d Fencl said. \u201cAny time we're not attuning to that, we're risking being maladaptive, and being more vulnerable, and taking steps backward, when we have so much work to do.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s latest round of flooding and record rainfall came amid a wide-ranging effort by the Trump administration to slash federal funding for climate research, fire government scientists, dismantle environmental regulations and accelerate fossil fuel production. The changes could jeopardize research meant to bring more clarity to Kentucky\u2019s intensifying rainfall, and possibly offer ways to mitigate recurrent flooding. A five-year, $20-million grant through the National Science Foundation, involving eight Kentucky universities, is focused on climate resilience across the commonwealth. Naylor and Ghasemi Fare, at the University of Louisville, are each conducting research related to extreme precipitation and flooding in the state through NSF funding. \u201cSeveral years ago, I wouldn\u2019t be worried about this grant being continued year by year, because we\u2019ve met our milestones, and all signs are that we will continue the funding,\u201d Naylor said. \u201cBut now, I\u2019m not 100% sure that the funding will continue.\u201d The Trump administration has also slashed funds supporting the National Climate Assessment, a scientific undertaking mandated by Congress to study the effects of climate change across the country to guide state and local decision-making, in addition to cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA provides crucial river forecasts, allowing local authorities to know when to expect waters to rise in a community. In Louisville, MSD executes a carefully crafted plan for flood protection operations across the city based on the timing of river levels provided by NOAA's forecasts. And the National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA, maintains \"one of the most advanced weather and climate programs in the world,\" Filippelli said \u2014 and through its forecasts of severe weather and early warnings, the agency has \"saved literally tens of thousands of American lives.\" As one bout of flooding after another thrashes Kentucky, events once thought to be generational are becoming typical. Experts who spoke to The Courier Journal said investments in understanding climate change and preparing for its onslaught will pay dividends in states like Kentucky. \"It will continue,\" Filippelli said. \"We have the ability to use science to get ahead of that. And so why don't we?\" Connor Giffin is an environmental reporter for The Courier Journal. Reach him directly at cgiffin@gannett.com\u00a0or on X @byconnorgiffin.",

Flooding is the state\u2019s \u201cmost frequent and costly natural disaster,\u201d according to the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet. Kentucky saw more flood-related disaster declarations than any other state between 2000-22, The Courier Journal previously reported based on Pew research and FEMA data, and is facing a growing number of national \u201cbillion-dollar disasters,\u201d largely driven by severe storms.\u00a0 In addition to flood damage, April\u2019s extreme weather also disrupted commerce \u2014 shutting down highways, closing locks and dam systems on the Ohio River, and pushing UPS to take the rare step of suspending some operations at the Louisville Worldport, the company\u2019s largest global air hub.\u00a0 Like other states, Kentucky\u2019s infrastructure is aging, underfunded and built for a climate that no longer exists. The coming decades of extreme weather will put bridges, dams and levees to the test, and experts say states like Kentucky should make climate-informed investments when building and rebuilding.\u00a0 Kentucky\u2019s waterways were still swollen when state officials began announcing evidence of damaged roads and bridges.\u00a0 High water, mudslides and rockslides caused more than 550 state road closures, and assessments soon found several bridges with damage, including KY 1462 in Marshall County and Tim Road bridge in Graves County.\u00a0 Following historic river levels in Louisville, Metropolitan Sewer District staff were walking the levee system and assessing the status of pump stations. Much of the system is\u00a0more than 70 years old.\u00a0 Mechanical failures were found at multiple Louisville pump stations, according to Dane Anderson, operations director for flood protection at MSD. Due to the age of the machinery, pump repairs sometimes require specialized parts fabrication and may take months to complete \u2014\u00a0and in that time, another flood could arrive.\u00a0 MSD\u2019s budget is already stretched thin. And the district recently learned it was among Kentucky agencies to lose some federal funding for flood protection efforts, The Courier Journal reported, as FEMA slashed a key program for supporting disaster mitigation projects.\u00a0 In the coming years and decades, flooding is expected to reach areas once thought to be safe, and with more regularity. In some places, it already has: Water inundated a part of Marshall County twice this year that was mapped by FEMA to have a 0.2% chance of flooding in any given year.\u00a0 Future infrastructure investments, experts said, must take into account not only historical events, but also projections for future conditions, fueled by climate change.\u00a0 \u201cBuild for the future,\u201d Filippelli said, \u201cdon\u2019t build for the past.\u201d\u00a0 Investments in more resilient infrastructure face hurdles because of larger upfront costs. But as Kentucky\u2019s rainfall patterns intensify, these investments will likely prove cheaper than the cost of rebuilding time after time, according to experts like Omid Ghasemi Fare, a University of Louisville professor and geotechnical engineering expert who is researching flood resilience in the state. \u201cIf we can work this problem beforehand,\u201d he said, ahead of\u00a0the next disaster, and\u00a0\u201cthink for a resilient infrastructure or enhance the resiliency, that can reduce the amount of money or budget that we need to spend every time after the flooding.\u201d\u00a0 These investments also take political will, and despite\u00a0near-unanimous agreement among experts on climate change, many of Kentucky\u2019s most powerful politicians have cast doubt on the science. In April \u2014 after President Donald Trump signed executive orders aimed at boosting the fading U.S. coal industry \u2014\u00a0Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers celebrated the move, and said the role of fossil fuels in climate change is \u201csubject to debate.\u201d But climate scientists and engineers are not the only ones calling for climate-informed investment. Climate change is already roiling insurance markets, and the banking industry is reassessing investments for a warming planet.\u00a0 \u201cWe now expect a 3C world,\u201d said investment firm Morgan Stanley in a recent analysis \u2014\u00a0referring to a threshold of warming at which the planet would see catastrophic changes due to unchecked carbon emissions. Resilient infrastructure does not solely consist of big-ticket investments like sturdier bridges and taller levees. Maintaining green space and permeable surfaces in communities and implementing green infrastructure like bioswales can be effective tactics for reining in floodwaters, experts said.\u00a0 In the wake of flooding and other disasters, leaders\u00a0are faced with \u201ca moment of opportunity to think and plan differently,\u201d said Amanda Fencl, director of climate science for the Union of Concerned Scientists\u2019 climate and energy program. \u201cEvery terrible disaster, every moment of recovery and investment \u2014 especially from public dollars \u2014 it should be helping us feel resilient, and proactively adapting to the changes that are coming,\u201d Fencl said. \u201cAny time we're not attuning to that, we're risking being maladaptive, and being more vulnerable, and taking steps backward, when we have so much work to do.\u201d Kentucky\u2019s latest round of flooding and record rainfall came amid a wide-ranging effort by the Trump administration to slash federal funding for climate research, fire government scientists, dismantle environmental regulations and accelerate fossil fuel production. The changes could jeopardize research meant to bring more clarity to Kentucky\u2019s intensifying rainfall, and possibly offer ways to mitigate recurrent flooding. A five-year, $20-million grant through the National Science Foundation, involving eight Kentucky universities, is focused on climate resilience across the commonwealth. Naylor and Ghasemi Fare, at the University of Louisville, are each conducting research related to extreme precipitation and flooding in the state through NSF funding. \u201cSeveral years ago, I wouldn\u2019t be worried about this grant being continued year by year, because we\u2019ve met our milestones, and all signs are that we will continue the funding,\u201d Naylor said. \u201cBut now, I\u2019m not 100% sure that the funding will continue.\u201d The Trump administration has also slashed funds supporting the National Climate Assessment, a scientific undertaking mandated by Congress to study the effects of climate change across the country to guide state and local decision-making, in addition to cuts at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA provides crucial river forecasts, allowing local authorities to know when to expect waters to rise in a community. In Louisville, MSD executes a carefully crafted plan for flood protection operations across the city based on the timing of river levels provided by NOAA's forecasts. And the National Weather Service, which is part of NOAA, maintains \"one of the most advanced weather and climate programs in the world,\" Filippelli said \u2014 and through its forecasts of severe weather and early warnings, the agency has \"saved literally tens of thousands of American lives.\" As one bout of flooding after another thrashes Kentucky, events once thought to be generational are becoming typical. Experts who spoke to The Courier Journal said investments in understanding climate change and preparing for its onslaught will pay dividends in states like Kentucky. \"It will continue,\" Filippelli said. \"We have the ability to use science to get ahead of that. And so why don't we?\"",

Pulaski has been running for 3 1/2 years,\" reads a July 17 Facebook post. \"They have been replacing the generators in all the wind towers. There are 100 of them in this wind farm. So evidently the life span on the generators on these things is about 3 to 4 years.\" The post then disparages wind power, asserting\u00a0that a \"huge\" amount of diesel fuel\u00a0required for repairs and maintenance.\u00a0\u00a0 The post was shared 18,000 times in three weeks, but it is inaccurate and misleading. Like any technology, wind turbine generators are\u00a0subject to manufacturing defects or other problems. However, they typically last much longer than three or four years, according to research\u00a0and industry representatives.\u00a0 Further, even when the fossil fuels required to manufacture, install, maintain and dispose of wind turbines are considered,\u00a0wind power releases far less greenhouse gases per kilowatt-hour than burning fossil fuels for electricity. Finally, while the post doesn't name a specific wind farm, the photo accompanying the post shows turbines at the\u00a0HillTopper wind farm\u00a0just outside of Mt. Pulaski, Illinois, according to a\u00a0spokesperson for the company that operates the farm, Enel Green Power. HillTopper recently replaced 17 gearboxes, not 100 generators.\u00a0 Follow us on Facebook!\u00a0Like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user\u00a0who shared the\u00a0claim for comment. There is no evidence that wind turbine generators have a lifespan of only three or four years. Jason Meeks, site manager of\u00a0HillTopper wind farm, told USA TODAY that generators are \"typically expected to last around 20 years.\"\u00a0 According to an analysis conducted in 2012 and 2013,\u00a0wind turbine generators have a failure rate of about three and a half\u00a0percent per year for the first 13 years,\u00a0Eric Lantz, wind analysis manager at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY in an email.\u00a0 Based on this failure rate, only 14 percent of generators would fail after four years.\u00a0However, the industry has worked to improve the technology in the years since then. Fact check: Energy costs of wind turbine manufacturing recouped in months Based on information from industry representatives, Lantz believes generator\u00a0failure rates are lower now than they were a decade ago.\u00a0But\u00a0National Renewable Energy Laboratory has not independently assessed more recent data, he said.\u00a0 While the post claims that all the generators are in the process of being replaced, Meeks said that HillTopper has not replaced any generators in its three and a half years of operation.\u00a0 Instead, 17 gearboxes had to be swapped out \"due to unforeseen and rare defects related to the equipment procured from a third-party manufacturer,\" he said.\u00a0A gearbox\u00a0is a device used to transform the relatively slow turbine blade rotation speeds into faster rotational speeds ideal for generator function. In addition to HillTopper, Enel Green Power operates the Whitney Hill wind farm outside of Mt. Pulaski, but this project\u00a0has not required any major recent repairs, according to Meeks.\u00a0\u00a0 Fact check: Wind turbine blades can be recycled, but it rarely happens today Wind turbine company Vestas also operates a large\u00a0wind farm about 15\u00a0miles east of Mt. Pulaski. Vestas spokesperson, Chelsea Sassara, told USA TODAY in an email that the company has not been replacing generators and that the turbine\u00a0pictured in the social media post did not belong to Vestas. The post is correct that utilizing\u00a0diesel-fueled vehicles to maintain wind turbines releases CO2.\u00a0However,\u00a0wind power still produces far less CO2 per kilowatt-hour than burning fossil fuels.\u00a0 Fact check: Storm damaged a wind turbine in Texas, not a heat wave When manufacturing, construction, maintenance, operation and\u00a0decommissioning are\u00a0considered, wind releases about 11 grams of CO2 equivalent per\u00a0kilowatt-hour, according to the Department of Energy.\u00a0Meanwhile, natural gas releases 465 grams per kilowatt-hour and\u00a0coal produces 980 grams per kilowatt-hour. \"That makes coal\u2019s carbon footprint almost\u00a090 times larger\u00a0than that of wind energy, and the footprint of natural gas more than 40 times larger,\" says the Department of Energy website. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that wind turbine generators typically only last three to four years.

        "onlytext": "Wind turbines, which contributed more than 9% of U.S. electricity in 2021, last roughly 20 to 25 years before they must be replaced, according to the Energy Information Administration.  But some social media users are claiming that wind turbine generators \u2013 the part that produces electricity when the turbine blades are spinning \u2013 must be replaced much more frequently. \"The wind farm in Mt. Pulaski has been running for 3 1/2 years,\" reads a July 17 Facebook post. \"They have been replacing the generators in all the wind towers. There are 100 of them in this wind farm. So evidently the life span on the generators on these things is about 3 to 4 years.\" The post then disparages wind power, asserting that a \"huge\" amount of diesel fuel required for repairs and maintenance.   The post was shared 18,000 times in three weeks, but it is inaccurate and misleading. Like any technology, wind turbine generators are subject to manufacturing defects or other problems. However, they typically last much longer than three or four years, according to research and industry representatives.  Further, even when the fossil fuels required to manufacture, install, maintain and dispose of wind turbines are considered, wind power releases far less greenhouse gases per kilowatt-hour than burning fossil fuels for electricity. Finally, while the post doesn't name a specific wind farm, the photo accompanying the post shows turbines at the HillTopper wind farm just outside of Mt. Pulaski, Illinois, according to a spokesperson for the company that operates the farm, Enel Green Power. HillTopper recently replaced 17 gearboxes, not 100 generators.  USA TODAY reached out to the Facebook user who shared the claim for comment. There is no evidence that wind turbine generators have a lifespan of only three or four years. Jason Meeks, site manager of HillTopper wind farm, told USA TODAY that generators are \"typically expected to last around 20 years.\"  According to an analysis conducted in 2012 and 2013, wind turbine generators have a failure rate of about three and a half percent per year for the first 13 years, Eric Lantz, wind analysis manager at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY in an email.  Based on this failure rate, only 14 percent of generators would fail after four years. However, the industry has worked to improve the technology in the years since then. Fact check: Energy costs of wind turbine manufacturing recouped in months Based on information from industry representatives, Lantz believes generator failure rates are lower now than they were a decade ago. But National Renewable Energy Laboratory has not independently assessed more recent data, he said.  While the post claims that all the generators are in the process of being replaced, Meeks said that HillTopper has not replaced any generators in its three and a half years of operation.  Instead, 17 gearboxes had to be swapped out \"due to unforeseen and rare defects related to the equipment procured from a third-party manufacturer,\" he said. A gearbox is a device used to transform the relatively slow turbine blade rotation speeds into faster rotational speeds ideal for generator function. In addition to HillTopper, Enel Green Power operates the Whitney Hill wind farm outside of Mt. Pulaski, but this project has not required any major recent repairs, according to Meeks.   Fact check: Wind turbine blades can be recycled, but it rarely happens today Wind turbine company Vestas also operates a large wind farm about 15 miles east of Mt. Pulaski. Vestas spokesperson, Chelsea Sassara, told USA TODAY in an email that the company has not been replacing generators and that the turbine pictured in the social media post did not belong to Vestas. The post is correct that utilizing diesel-fueled vehicles to maintain wind turbines releases CO2. However, wind power still produces far less CO2 per kilowatt-hour than burning fossil fuels.  Fact check: Storm damaged a wind turbine in Texas, not a heat wave When manufacturing, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning are considered, wind releases about 11 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour, according to the Department of Energy. Meanwhile, natural gas releases 465 grams per kilowatt-hour and coal produces 980 grams per kilowatt-hour. \"That makes coal\u2019s carbon footprint almost 90 times larger than that of wind energy, and the footprint of natural gas more than 40 times larger,\" says the Department of Energy website. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that wind turbine generators typically only last three to four years. According to 2013 data, only 14% of generators would be expected to fail after four years, and an expert says lifespans have likely increased since then. The wind farm shown in the social media post is not in the process of replacing all of its generators but recently replaced 17 gearboxes, according to the company that operates the farm.",

        "lede_neutral_gpt": "Amid swirling social media claims alleging that wind turbine generators have a shockingly short lifespan, industry experts and fact-checkers are setting the record straight: the generators are built to last around two decades, not just three or four years. While a viral Facebook post claimed the HillTopper wind farm had replaced all its generators in just three and a half years, the farm's operators clarified that only 17 gearboxes were swapped due to rare defects. Even accounting for manufacturing and maintenance, wind energy is far cleaner than fossil fuels, releasing significantly fewer greenhouse gases per kilowatt-hour and demonstrating the robustness and sustainability of this renewable energy source.",
        "lede_skeptic_gpt": "Despite social media buzz claiming wind turbine generators need replacement every three to four years, a closer look reveals a much more durable truth: these machines generally boast a lifespan closer to 20 years. While some skeptics highlight the occasional need for maintenance, such as a recent gearbox swap at an Illinois wind farm, wind power still releases far less CO2 than traditional fossil fuels. Industry experts emphasize ongoing advancements in technology that continue to bolster the reliability and sustainability of wind energy."

        "text": " BBC three-part series features never-before-seen documents, exclusive interviews with industry players, and testimony from leading scientists, politicians and CEOs As the UK sees record-breaking temperatures and forest fires devastate major areas of Europe, climate change is dominating news headlines. Now, a new BBC series tells the story of how we got here, charting decades of failure to tackle climate change. Part of the award-winning This World series, Big Oil vs the World is a fascinating look at how oil giants fuelled climate change denial, despite warnings from their own scientists of the risks carbon emissions posed to the planet. Drawing on thousands of newly discovered documents, the series goes on to chart, in revelatory and forensic detail, how the oil industry then mounted a campaign to sow doubt about the science of climate change, the consequences of which we are living through today. Part One: Denial Based on a year of investigative research, part one of the series: Denial tells the story of what the fossil fuel industry knew about climate change more than four decades ago, unveiling a complex campaign of media spin and political lobbying to spread scepticism on climate change. Speaking in the film, former US Vice-President Al Gore describes the efforts of big oil companies to delay the response to climate change as \u201cthe most serious crime of the post-world war two era\u201d. \u201cI think it's the moral equivalent of a war crime\u2026 The consequences of what they've done are just almost unimaginable,\u201d he said. In the programme, scientists who worked for the biggest oil company in the world, Exxon, reveal the warnings they sounded in the 1970s and early 1980s about how fossil fuels would cause climate change \u2013 with potentially catastrophic effects. Discussing Exxon\u2019s failure to act over the years, Dr Ed Garvey, who joined Exxon\u2019s climate science research team in 1978, says that the company was aware that continuing to burn fossil fuels would mean significant climate impacts in the future. \u201cit's just squandered time, and we're going to pay for it,\u201d he states. Former United States Senator Chuck Hagel, who in the late 1990s led the charge in the US Senate against America joining an international agreement to reduce emissions, now says that the oil industry lied and misled him. \u201cIt\u2019s cost the country, and it cost the world,\u201d he admits. \u2018Denial\u2019 features first-hand accounts from politicians and activists fighting for action on climate change, including former Vice President Al Gore, as well as PR executives, scientists and economists paid by the oil industry. Part Two: Doubt Part two, Doubt, charts how the oil industry\u2019s campaign to block action against climate change continued into the new millennium, even as the science grew more certain. George W. Bush\u2019s former environment chief Christine Todd Whitman explains how industry lobbyists and Vice President Dick Cheney persuaded Bush to reverse his campaign promise to cut emissions. \u201cIt really was a tragedy. I think if President Bush had gone forward with a cap on carbon, it would have made an enormous difference,\u201d she states. Speaking for the first time on camera, a disaffected former ExxonMobil geoscientist and climate change specialist, Bill Heins, reflects on the disconnect between what the company\u2019s scientists knew, and what the CEO Lee Raymond was saying publicly about climate change.The film also unravels the story of the Koch Brothers\u2019 extraordinarily successful effort to block President Obama\u2019s early efforts to pass climate change legislation, and subsequent campaign to reshape the Republican Party into one in which climate denialism became the mainstream position of the party. A lawyer who worked for Kochs through this period speaks on camera for the first time about the campaign, as does Steve Lonegan of the Koch-funded group Americans for Prosperity \u2013 who boasts that their effort \u201cput an end to the whole climate change argument. Since then till now, it\u2019s been a dead issue.\u201d BP\u2019s former CEO Lord Browne tells the story of how BP first broke with the rest of the oil industry in acknowledging the reality of human-caused climate change, and re-branding as \u2018Beyond Petroleum\u2019. Accused of greenwashing by both environmentalists and other oil majors, Lord Browne continues to defend his record \u2013 although acknowledges that BP\u2019s push into renewables ultimately fell short. \u201cLooking backwards over the last 25 years, we really have lost a quarter century in what we should have been doing,\u201d Browne states. Part Three: Delay The third and final part of the series, Delay, follows the fossil fuel industry up to the present day, and examines recent efforts to hold Big Oil legally accountable for the climate crisis. Delving into the world of fracking, revealing how big oil companies courted the Obama administration by presenting natural gas as an environmentally-friendly alternative to oil and coal. Obama climate official Heather Zichal now acknowledges for the first time that the administration did not realise how the natural gas boom would only worsen the climate crisis. She says, \u201cDid it turn out we had it wrong? Absolutely.\u201d Former ExxonMobil engineer, Dar Lon Chang, speaks for the first time on camera alleging that as the company increased its natural gas operations, it was not sufficiently monitoring methane leaks that were contributing to climate change. \u201cThere wasn't much appetite for management to measure methane leakage because, if they found out there was a problem, they would have to do something about it,\u201d he states. But the film also speaks with activist Sharon Wilson who has spent more than a decade documenting methane leaks at sites operated by ExxonMobil and other oil and gas companies. Still travelling across the US in 2022, collecting evidence of ongoing leaks, she says: \u201cWe can have a future, or we can have oil and gas, but we cannot have both.\u201d The Kochs did not respond to requests for an interview or statement. ExxonMobil did not grant any interviews for the series, but told the BBC in a written statement that its \u2018public statements about climate change are, and have always been, truthful, fact-based, transparent and consistent with the contemporary understanding of mainstream climate science.\u2019 ExxonMobil said it\u2019s been an industry leader in the effort to reduce methane emissions and has been using advanced technology to detect leaks. The company says the litigation is \u2018baseless\u2019 and \u2018without merit\u2019; and \u2018there is no truth to the suggestion that ExxonMobil ever misled the public or policymakers about climate change.\u2019 Big Oil vs the World: Denial airs on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer, 9pm, Thursday 21 July. Notes to Editors Big Oil vs the World is a Mongoose Pictures production for the BBC in association with FRONTLINE.

        "title": "5 ways the Inflation Reduction Act would fight climate change",
        "text": " Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News  news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time More clean energy, less dirty energy, new punishments for methane leaks and billions of dollars for communities most in need of climate-related help \u2014 those are the provisions that have environmentalists celebrating what they see as a monumental step for U.S. climate action. Senate Democrats on Sunday passed a sweeping bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, that includes hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change. The package calls for major spending to tackle the climate crisis, in addition to extending health care coverage and reducing the deficit. On top of tax credits to provide incentives for electric vehicles and clean energy, the bill aims to expand renewable energy production and fund the development of technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While the climate part of the legislation was significantly pared down from the Biden administration's original ambitions in the Build Back Better Act, experts say that if the bill is enacted, it would be the largest investment to address global warming in U.S. history and that it would reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Dan Lashof, the U.S. director of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit research group, called the bill \"transformative,\" adding that it was the culmination of decades of work to enact meaningful climate legislation. \"It would be hard to overstate what a pivotal moment this was with the Senate,\" he said at a news briefing Monday. From cutting emissions to helping the U.S. economy make the transition away from fossil fuels, here are five ways the Inflation Reduction Act could actually fight climate change. The bill would devote $369 billion over 10 years for electric vehicle and clean energy tax breaks, a measure that Lashof said would establish clean energy as the most cost-effective option for Americans. \"If you look at the incentives across electric vehicles, electricity production from wind, solar and clean hydrogen, carbon removal \u2014 it really establishes an economic framework that makes clean energy the choice,\" he said. The tax credits, which are designed to help pivot industry and consumers to renewable energy systems, include incentives for electric appliances, heat pumps and other technologies to increase energy efficiency in homes. Consumers would also be eligible for $7,500 tax credits for buying new electric vehicles and $4,000 credits for used electric vehicles. The provisions would help people lower their energy costs and, over time, help the country \"transform\" its entire energy system, Lashof said. Climate experts say the bill could reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% below 2005 levels by 2030, an important step toward staving off the worst consequences of global warming.  President Joe Biden had set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country by at least 50% by the end of the decade. A preliminary estimate by the Rhodium Group, an independent research and data firm that tracks such targets, found that Biden's goal could be achievable with the Inflation Reduction Act and other measures at the federal, state and local levels. \"If Congress passes this package, additional action from executive agencies and subnational actors can put the US's target of cutting emissions in half by 2030 within reach,\" the report said. Biden's targets to reduce emissions are part of the broader goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius to limit irreversible impacts on ecosystems and human health. \"It could not come soon enough,\" Manish Bapna, the president and CEO of\u00a0the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group, said in a statement. \"This law puts the nation's goals for combatting climate pollution within reach, while millions are suffering through yet another summer of extreme weather disasters.\" While the bill is being hailed as a historic breakthrough, it does include some concessions that resulted from hard-fought negotiations with Sen.\u00a0Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. Senate Democrats agreed to include new oil drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska.  Still, the measure would introduce a fee that would penalize fossil fuel companies for excess methane emissions from drilling oil and gas.  Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that is released into the atmosphere when coal, oil and natural gas are mined and transported. Microbes can also emit methane in low-oxygen environments.  Emissions of methane have been responsible for about 30 percent of global warming since preindustrial times, according to the U.N. Environment Program. The climate bill earmarks $60 billion for environmental justice initiatives in disadvantaged communities that are disproportionately affected by climate change. That includes $3 billion in grants to promote clean and accessible transportation and $1 billion for clean buses, garbage trucks and other heavy-duty vehicles. The provisions would help front-line communities deal with air pollution and other important public health issues, said Christina DeConcini, the World Resource Institute's director of government affairs. \"Of course, it's not enough, but it's great that there's a start there,\" she said. The bill also includes funding for rural communities and communities with fossil fuel-based economies to make the transition to clean energy. Experts agreed that if it is implemented, the Inflation Reduction Act would play an important role in signaling to the global community that the U.S. is serious about doing its part to fight climate change. The measure not only would help the country catch up to aggressive climate measures introduced in places like the European Union; it could spur other countries to act. In about four months, leaders from around the world will gather in Egypt for the U.N. Climate Change Conference to accelerate efforts to reduce emissions, implement adaptations and negotiate financing. The climate provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act could help send a message ahead of the meeting that the U.S. is ready to step up, said Nisha Krishnan, an expert on climate resilience at the World Resources Institute. The bill would essentially put the U.S. in \"a much better place to actually encourage these countries to stand by their existing commitments, but also to raise their ambitions,\" Krishnan said.

        "onlytext": "There are no new alerts at this time\n\nMore clean energy, less dirty energy, new punishments for methane leaks and billions of dollars for communities most in need of climate-related help \u2014 those are the provisions that have environmentalists celebrating what they see as a monumental step for U.S. climate action. Senate Democrats on Sunday passed a sweeping bill, known as the Inflation Reduction Act, that includes hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change. The package calls for major spending to tackle the climate crisis, in addition to extending health care coverage and reducing the deficit. \n\nOn top of tax credits to provide incentives for electric vehicles and clean energy, the bill aims to expand renewable energy production and fund the development of technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. While the climate part of the legislation was significantly pared down from the Biden administration's original ambitions in the Build Back Better Act, experts say that if the bill is enacted, it would be the largest investment to address global warming in U.S. history and that it would reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nDan Lashof, the U.S. director of the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit research group, called the bill \"transformative,\" adding that it was the culmination of decades of work to enact meaningful climate legislation. \"It would be hard to overstate what a pivotal moment this was with the Senate,\" he said at a news briefing Monday. From cutting emissions to helping the U.S. economy make the transition away from fossil fuels, here are five ways the Inflation Reduction Act could actually fight climate change.\n\nThe bill would devote $369 billion over 10 years for electric vehicle and clean energy tax breaks, a measure that Lashof said would establish clean energy as the most cost-effective option for Americans. \"If you look at the incentives across electric vehicles, electricity production from wind, solar and clean hydrogen, carbon removal \u2014 it really establishes an economic framework that makes clean energy the choice,\" he said. \n\nThe tax credits, which are designed to help pivot industry and consumers to renewable energy systems, include incentives for electric appliances, heat pumps and other technologies to increase energy efficiency in homes. Consumers would also be eligible for $7,500 tax credits for buying new electric vehicles and $4,000 credits for used electric vehicles. The provisions would help people lower their energy costs and, over time, help the country \"transform\" its entire energy system, Lashof said.\n\nClimate experts say the bill could reduce U.S. emissions by about 40% below 2005 levels by 2030, an important step toward staving off the worst consequences of global warming.  President Joe Biden had set a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the country by at least 50% by the end of the decade.

The proposal to build a direct air capture plant, announced in September by Swiss company Climeworks and Kenya-based Great Carbon Valley, has been billed as a springboard for creating a new, green economy in Africa as the world is expected to invest trillions of dollars in climate-related investment in the coming years. Direct-air capture sucks in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it underground, a process that is relatively energy intensive. The technology has been criticized by some climate scientists who argue that the technology is a dangerous distraction from the only viable solution to climate change: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning en masse away from fossil fuels. Others say that direct air capture is a necessary part of a diverse effort to limit global warming. \u201cThe world is going to need to decarbonize,\u201d said Bilha Ndirangu, CEO of Great Carbon Valley. \u201cThere will be different investments and innovations in decarbonization efforts. How do we make sure that some of those investments are happening in Africa?\u201d The case for investing in Africa is heightened by the disproportionate impacts of climate change, such as extreme drought and flooding, on African nations that have contributed little to the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. Last month, discussions at the United Nations and the Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi focused on how to attract more capital to the continent \u2014 the world\u2019s youngest continent, with 70% of sub-Saharan Africa under the age of 30. Calls for investment in Africa are tempered by watchdogs who say foreign investment in the global South can be harmful if investors from the global North prioritize profit over the safety and rights of local populations. \u201cThere\u2019s a real need for safeguards on where these projects are taking place,\u201d said Ugbaad Kosar, the director of environmental justice at Carbon180, a climate nonprofit that advocates for equitable carbon removal. \u201cAnd once that\u2019s decided, it\u2019s important to track how the resources, benefits and risks are being distributed among the companies and vulnerable populations.\u201d Carbon removal companies such as Climeworks create units of carbon dioxide removed by their plants and companies can buy those units to offset their carbon emissions. With carbon removal, companies that continue to use fossil fuels can claim to be carbon-neutral because they purchased offsets created by some carbon removal plants. Climeworks said it only works with companies that plan to reduce emissions over time, using carbon removal as just one tool in that process. \u201cAll direct air capture does is help fossil fuel companies pretend they\u2019re taking climate action while they continue to drill for oil,\u201d Jonathan Foley, a climate scientist and founder of Project Drawdown, a nonprofit climate group, said. \u201cTrading a few seconds of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions to give oil and gas companies a fig leaf is not a good bargain.\u201d The plant, projected to be completed by 2028, will be built in the Great Rift Valley, an intercontinental depression rich in deep basalt formations that extends across Kenya from Tanzania and onward to Ethiopia. Ndirangu said that the project is an opportunity for Kenya to tackle the climate crisis while creating jobs and expanding the renewable energy grid.\u00a0 Kenya has a relatively small energy grid that relies mostly on renewable energy. The country is rich in geothermal, solar and wind potential \u2014 but that renewable energy potential is untapped, said Carlijn Nouwen, co-founder of the nonprofit Climate Action Platform for Africa.\u00a0 Many energy companies see little incentive to invest in Kenya\u2019s energy infrastructure, but the energy-intensive Climeworks project could help attract investment in the grid and in turn benefit Kenyan citizens, Nouwen said \u2014 though she cautioned that Kenyan policymakers would need to enact policies to ensure the new energy reaches citizens. Ol\u00faf\u1eb9\u0301mi O. T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2, a professor of philosophy specializing in climate justice at Georgetown University, said he was skeptical that the project would benefit Kenyans over protecting the companies\u2019 bottom lines.\u00a0 \u201cThe investment coming in is to set up carbon removal that allows corporations in rich countries to dump their carbon pollution in the global South,\u201d T\u00e1\u00edw\u00f2 said. \u201cThat\u2019s not the kind of investment that inspires confidence in our progress on climate justice.\u201d\u00a0 Whether the technology is helpful or harmful, most experts agree that direct air capture is limited by massive price tags, heavy energy requirements and lack of scalability. Globally, 27 direct air capture plants remove 100,000 metric tons of CO\u2082 annually \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 36.8 billion metric tons of CO\u2082 pumped into the atmosphere by human activities in 2022.\u00a0 Some say investing in direct air capture technology is pointless. \u201cWe don\u2019t have an infinite amount of renewable energy,\u201d said Mark Jacobson, a professor of environmental engineering at Stanford University. \u201cIf it\u2019s being used for direct air capture, it\u2019s not being used for something else. And right now, all our renewable energy is needed to replace fossil fuels.\u201d\u00a0 Julie Gosalvez, chief marketing officer of Climeworks, said judging the potential of a technology based on its current efficiency is not right, adding that the company plans to bring their net carbon removal into the billions of metric tons over the next few decades.\u00a0 Gosalvez added that about 90% of the climate solution is cutting carbon emissions by transitioning from fossil fuels, but emphasized that some carbon removal is needed.\u00a0 Many global climate leaders agree.

A once-every-four-years\u00a0scientific assessment\u00a0found recovery in progress, more than 35 years after every nation in the world agreed to stop producing chemicals that chomp on the layer of ozone in Earth\u2019s atmosphere that shields the planet from harmful radiation linked to skin cancer, cataracts and crop damage. \u201cIn the upper stratosphere and in the ozone hole we see things getting better,\u201d said Paul Newman, co-chair of the scientific assessment. The progress is slow, according to the report presented Monday at the American Meteorological Society convention in Denver. The global average amount of ozone 18 miles (30 kilometers) high in the atmosphere won\u2019t be back to 1980 pre-thinning levels until about 2040, the report said. And it won\u2019t be back to normal in the Arctic until 2045. \u201cOzone action sets a precedent for climate action. Our success in phasing out ozone-eating chemicals shows us what can and must be done \u2014 as a matter of urgency \u2014 to transition away from fossil fuels, reduce greenhouse gases and so limit temperature increase,\u201d World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Prof. Petteri Taalas said in a statement. Signs of healing were reported four years ago but were slight and more preliminary. \u201cThose numbers of recovery have solidified a lot,\u201d Newman said. The two chief chemicals that munch away at ozone are in lower levels in the atmosphere, said Newman, chief Earth scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. Chlorine levels are down 11.5% since they peaked in 1993 and bromine, which is more efficient at eating ozone but is at lower levels in the air, dropped 14.5% since its 1999 peak, the report said. That bromine and chlorine levels \u201cstopped growing and is coming down is a real testament to the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol,\u201d Newman said. \u201cThere has been a sea change in the way our society deals with ozone depleting substances,\u201d said scientific panel co-chair David W. Fahey, director of the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s chemical sciences lab. Decades ago, people could go into a store and buy a can of refrigerants that eat away at the ozone, punch a hole in it and pollute the atmosphere, Fahey said. Now, not only are the substances banned but they are no longer much in people\u2019s homes or cars, replaced by cleaner chemicals. Natural weather patterns in the Antarctic also affect ozone hole levels, which peak in the fall. And the past couple years, the holes have been a bit bigger because of that but the overall trend is one of healing, Newman said. This is \u201csaving 2 million people every year from skin cancer,\u201d United Nations Environment Programme Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press earlier this year in an email. A few years ago emissions of one of the banned chemicals, chlorofluorocarbon-11 (CFC-11), stopped shrinking and was rising. Rogue emissions were spotted in part of China but now have gone back down to where they are expected, Newman said. A third generation of those chemicals, called HFC, was banned a few years ago not because it would eat at the ozone layer but because it is a heat-trapping greenhouse gas. The new report says that the ban would avoid 0.5 to 0.9 degrees of additional warming. The report also warned that efforts to artificially cool the planet by putting aerosols into the atmosphere to reflect the sunlight would thin the ozone layer by as much as 20% in Antarctica.

Despite the successful reduction of ozone-depleting chemicals following global action decades ago, questions linger about the feasibility and impact of transitioning away from more reliable fossil fuels. With natural phenomena and some setbacks indicating bumps on the road to recovery, the call for drastic climate measures may seem premature to those wary of sacrificing economic stability for uncertain gains."

Back-to-back months of heat records and sweltering days have contributed to rising electricity costs, and experts say that without action, it's a problem that will likely only get worse.\u00a0 According to CBS News' price tracker, the cost of electricity has increased from $0.14 per kilowatt hour in 2019 to $0.18 per kilowatt hour in 2024 \u2014 a change of more than 28.5%. The average American is now paying nearly $300 a month just in utilities.\u00a0 For many people, it just isn't affordable.\u00a0 \"Sometimes I have to choose whether I'm going to pay the light bill or do I pay all the rent or buy food or not let my son do a sport?\" Stacey Freeman, a 44-year-old North Carolina mom told KFF Health News. Her energy bills have cost her hundreds a month, even as she relied on window units and space heaters in the summer and winter.\u00a0 Freeman's situation is known as \"energy poverty,\" or the inability to afford utilities to properly heat or cool their home.\u00a0 A 2022 study published in\u00a0Nature Communications found that 16% of U.S. households experience energy poverty, which researchers defined as spending more than 6% of household income on energy expenditures. It's not a problem solely for those who are considered low-income. The study found that 5.2 million households that live above the poverty line face this issue, with Black, Hispanic and Native American communities feeling a disproportionate impact.\u00a0 \"Energy inequity is an issue of increasing urgency,\" the study says. \"...creating a federal energy poverty line would be a critical step in identifying families that face large disparities in access to affordable electricity and energy in the U.S. and improve programs' abilities to address energy burdens.\" The cost of electricity is based on a multitude of factors, including the volatile prices for natural gas, wildfire risk, electricity transmission and distribution, regulations and, the one factor Americans know all too well, inflation. But experts say there's an underlying problem that, unlike inflation, isn't going away anytime soon \u2014 the heat.\u00a0 Recent years have seen back-to-back heat records across the world, including in the U.S. Rising temperatures fuel extreme weather events, such as heat waves in the summer and snow storms in the winter, which then increases energy consumption as people try to keep their homes warm or cool. It also increases the costs for the utility companies themselves to make sure that the electric infrastructure can handle it.\u00a0 Currently, it can't. Power outages remain a major problem across the U.S. When Tropical Storm Ernesto passed by the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico earlier this month, it\u00a0knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of residents. At one point, nearly half of Puerto Rico and almost all of USVI were without electricity. But it's not just the islands \u2014 it's the mainland too. Of all the major power outages in the U.S. from 2000 to 2023, scientists at the nonprofit Climate Central found that 80% were because of weather.\u00a0 Every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers issues a \"report card\" on how U.S. infrastructure fares in a variety of categories. In the latest report, the energy sector received a C-.\u00a0 Engineering experts acknowledged that spending on transmission lines had grown and that utilities were being proactive about strengthening the national grid, but said that \"weather remains an increasing threat\" that is continuously causing power outages. Transmission and distribution systems are a major concern, they said, and \"is likely to accelerate as the impacts of climate change persist and the public's expectation of more reliable, 'always-on' electricity increases.\" \"While the weather has always been the number one threat to the energy sector's reliability, climate change has only exacerbated the frequency and intensity of these events and associated costs,\" the report states. \"The Department of Energy (DOE) found that power outages are costing the U.S. economy $28 billion to $169 billion annually.\"\u00a0 Multiple polls and studies show how pervasive energy poverty and the heat can be. An early August poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 39% of Americans say that heat has had a \"major impact\" on their electricity bills, with another 30% identifying a \"minor impact.\" About 40% of poll takers say they also had unexpected utility expenses because of extreme weather events, including storms, flooding, heat and wildfires.\u00a0 The heat isn't just costly, it's also dangerous. Extreme heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S. and is known for exacerbating cardiovascular and respiratory conditions. The cold is also a concern, with the EPA reporting that more than 19,000 Americans have died from cold-related causes since 1979. \"Not only are households living in more poverty and closer proximity to highly polluted areas at greater risk of adverse health impacts,\" the 2022 Nature study says. \"They must also consume more energy to overcome the particulate emissions, which, themselves, reduce the efficiency of clean sources such as solar panels.\" Experts say there is a long-term solution that can drastically help \u2014 clean energy.\u00a0 In 2023, about 60% of U.S. electricity generation came from the burning of fossil fuels, one of the primary drivers of rising global temperatures, according to the Energy Information Administration. Renewable energy has hit record highs, but last year, it was only used for 21% of electricity generation.\u00a0 A March 2020 study found that the continued warming of the planet could take a significant toll on U.S. energy infrastructure as-is. Specifically, the study found that the most costly aspects will be the reduced lifespan of substation transformers and the increased need for vegetation management expenditures. \"Total infrastructure costs were found to rise considerably, with annual climate change expenditures increasing by as much as 25%,\" the study says. \"The results demonstrate that climate impacts will likely be substantial, though this analysis only captures a portion of the total potential impacts.\"\u00a0 They found that if the U.S. were to more aggressively tackle climate change, it could reduce the expected costs by as much as 50% by 2090.\u00a0 Expanding clean energy has already proven to help communities.\u00a0 In July, the think tank Energy Innovation found that \"states with high levels of wind and solar generation like New Mexico, Iowa, and Oklahoma have experienced the lowest rate increases\" in energy bills. When Hurricane Ian hit Florida in 2022, a community that runs completely on solar power managed to escape relatively unscathed while the areas around it faced rampant destruction. In 2021, The Center for American Progress found that investments in clean energy infrastructure could save U.S. households $500 every year just on energy costs.\u00a0 And this is why it's critical for better policy and funding, experts say.\u00a0 \"Clean energy technologies are expected to continue to decline in costs, enable substantial emissions reductions in the electricity sector without increasing costs,\" Energy Innovation found in its report this year, noting, however, that it is up to regulators and policymakers to ensure that consumers are not hit with \"unnecessary costs and risks\" associated with the transition to clean energy. Better planning, competitive resource procurement, grid-enhancing technologies, cooperation enhancement, and other strategies could help alleviate that issue, the group said, adding, \"Regulators and policymakers have a range of tools they can deploy to mitigate pressure on rising rates, ensuring an affordable and accessible transition to clean electricity.\" Li Cohen is a senior social media producer at CBS News.

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nJanuary 10, 2023 / 9:55 AM EST\n          / CBS News\n         The destructiveness of extreme weather is one of the biggest stories of our time. When it comes to fire, drought and floods, we spend a lot of time showing you the effects of climate change. But it's also important to talk about the causes.    That is why CBS is making it a priority to report on climate change with \"On the Dot\" with David Schechter. In this ongoing reporting project, we will take you on a journey to discover how humans are changing the Earth and how the Earth is changing us.\u00a0 As each day passes, an invisible problem is creating more danger for people on Earth. That invisible problem is carbon dioxide, and too much of it in the atmosphere is what drives climate change. Carbon dioxide comes from the fossil fuel energy we use, the vehicles we drive and the products we make. And according to NASA, people have raised the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 50% since the beginning of the 18th century. \u00a0 \"I think this is our main social environmental challenge for humanity, is how to live on this planet so that not only the benefits that we've enjoyed of a stable climate, of access to fresh water, of you know, not having fires in our neighborhood, that our children and our children's children have those same benefits,\" said Dr. Eugene Cordero, a climatologist at San Jose State University. \"And I think we should be very, very concerned about this.\"\u00a0 Mauna Loa is the largest active volcano on the planet. Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, it towers more than 13,000 ft. above sea level. If it sounds familiar, it recently got a lot of attention for its eruptions and stunning lava flows. The most recent eruption happened in November, for the first time in almost four decades.    What may be less known is the Mauna Loa Observatory that sits on the volcano up a narrow one-lane road through a lava field. It's about a 90-minute drive southeast from the city of Kailua-Kona, on the western coast of the island.\u00a0 \"It's not the easiest place to get to,\" said Aidan Colton, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, about the observatory that is quite near the top of the volcano. \"It's 11,000-foot elevation. Every time we take a breath of air, you're breathing in a third less oxygen.\"   Colton said it is the air that makes this remote location so important. At more than two miles high, it is far above any ground-level pollution from communities below. It is also surrounded by 2,000 miles of open ocean. That means by the time air makes its way to Mauna Loa, it has been blended with air from across the globe.   The observatory is where scientists for the last 65 years have relied on the carbon dioxide measurements taken to establish how much humans are altering our planet.   Colton's job is to take those measurements.  He grabs air samples in two separate ways. The first is by hand, capturing air in pressurized bottles on a weekly basis that are sent to a lab in Colorado for analysis. The second is from a tower that is another 140 feet up. It pulls and analyzes samples on site, 24 hours a day, with hourly findings published online. \"Our job is to present the facts. And the fact is that carbon dioxide is increasing, and it has been increasing since we started monitoring it,\" said Colton.   Since 1958, samples taken in Hawaii have shown the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rising year after year. Those measurements make up what is called the Keeling Curve, named after scientist Dr. Charles Keeling who began this research and gave birth to modern climate science.   By going back 800,000 years and studying things like ice core samples, ocean sediment and tree rings, scientists have a good idea how much carbon has historically been in the Earth's atmosphere. Carbon dioxide levels go up and down over time, but they never went higher than 300 parts per million. \u00a0 In June, the Keeling Curve hit an all-time high of 421 parts per million.    \"The CO2 in the atmosphere has never been seen this high in human history,\" said Colton. \u00a0 Since carbon dioxide is invisible, there wasn't always a way to \"see\" where it is coming from. Which is where entrepreneurs come in. Davida Herzl is the CEO of Aclima. Her company operates a fleet of cars outfitted with tubes and sensors that analyze the air for 14 kinds of pollution. One of them is carbon dioxide, which floats, invisibly, into the atmosphere and can stay up there for hundreds of years. \u00a0 \"I think what this data shows you is that, you know, with every decision, every action, there's a direct consequence,\" said Herzl. \"And now you can actually see it, right? You can look up your address. You can look at what's happening, you know, at your location. But you can also start to connect with, wow, if I choose to drive an electric vehicle or if I choose to invest in decarbonization in my home, I'm actually helping to reduce these overall levels. This isn't just an invisible problem. You can see it. It's visible, it's measurable.\"\u00a0 Businesses and governments use Aclima's data to identify and reduce sources of pollution.\u00a0 \"To deal with climate change, to deal with air pollution, you really have to understand where it's coming from, and you have to take local measurements to do that,\" said Herzl.\u00a0 The \"On the Dot\" team joined Herzl on a drive around the freeways of Oakland, California, in one of her pollution-sensing cars. The car uses GPS to plot pollution levels on a map.\u00a0 \"We're moving through the streets,\" said Herzl. \"That enables us to pinpoint the precise location of those measurements.\" \u00a0 There are a lot of ways that CO2 gets into the air. But according to the EPA, the number one source of carbon emissions is transportation, at 27% of greenhouse gases.\u00a0 Aclima's pollution map shows that. On the side streets, carbon dioxide levels are mostly low, showing up visually as the low-intensity color of purple. On the freeways, carbon dioxide is shown in a high-intensity yellow. At locations where two highways come together the yellow peaks so high it rises on a 3D map like a skyscraper.\u00a0 Herzl said even when people drive to work or school, they are contributing to pollution.    \"You're putting CO2 into the air,\" she said. \"And so, once we can all understand that and this problem isn't so abstract and so invisible, you start to really connect your actions to these global consequences.\" \u00a0 Dr. Eugene Cordero, a climatologist at San Jose State University, is helping people understand how the greenhouse effect is powered by carbon dioxide, with a demonstration that uses a candle and a camera.   \"We're trying to get an idea of how this greenhouse effect works,\" said Cordero. \"How does CO2 have this power over controlling the Earth's temperature?\"    The greenhouse effect is the way Earth's heat gets trapped close to the surface.    In the experiment, the candle represents the heat of Earth.   \"So, the Earth gets warmed during the day by the sun and then it gives off energy,\" he said.    A piece of glass in a picture frame represents carbon dioxide, which Cordero said acts in a similar way.   \"It behaves in the same way because it absorbs this particular kind of [energy given off by the candle],\" he said. \u00a0 When a thermal imaging camera is pointed at the candle, wavelengths of heat show up as white, red and yellow. \u00a0 But when a piece of glass is slipped in front of the flame, that color disappears, and the candle cannot be seen anymore. \u00a0 \"Our natural light from the sun passes through,\" said Cordero. \"But the infrared radiation on the way out, can't get out.\"\u00a0 Cordero said carbon dioxide is a blanket that absorbs and radiates heat and keeps the Earth comfortably warm. When more carbon dioxide is added, the planet gets warmer.   \"And so, our planet's temperature is going to go up,\" said Cordero. \"It's a great thermostat.\"    As the carbon dioxide rises, the temperature rises. Cordero said scientific research shows that is what is driving extreme events. A warming climate means hotter temperatures that can drive more intense wildfires and drought. Warmer air also carries more moisture which can lead to more precipitation during major storms.   \"CO2 and other greenhouse gases is the largest contribution to changing what our planet's like right now and making it warmer,\" said Cordero. \"There are other factors, too, but carbon dioxide is the number one contributor.\" \u00a0 Many scientists, like Cordero, remain hopeful that we can adapt and make changes.\u00a0 \"We have ways to generate energy without burning fossil fuels,\" said Cordero. \"We have ways to live more sustainably. And some people would say our life might even improve,\" he continued. \"I tell my students; would you rather be 45 minutes in traffic to go 15 miles, or take a train and be able to finish your homework while you're on the train and maybe we're listening to music or chatting with the neighbors?\"\u00a0 \"We have created some changes on our planet,\" he continued. \"Some good, some not so good. Maybe the balance of it is not so good for long term. But that doesn't mean we can't reverse that and make things better. And it doesn't have to make our life worse. But we have to do something.\"\u00a0 On future episodes of \"On the Dot\" we will continue to explore the problem of climate change and what we can do about it, looking at extreme weather, fire, drought and floods. \u00a0 David Schechter is a national environmental correspondent and the host of \"On the Dot with David Schechter,\" a guided journey to explore how we're changing the earth and earth is changing us. \n\u00a9 2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

        "onlytext": "The destructiveness of extreme weather is one of the biggest stories of our time. When it comes to fire, drought and floods, we spend a lot of time showing you the effects of climate change. But it's also important to talk about the causes.    That is why CBS is making it a priority to report on climate change with \"On the Dot\" with David Schechter. In this ongoing reporting project, we will take you on a journey to discover how humans are changing the Earth and how the Earth is changing us. \n\nAs each day passes, an invisible problem is creating more danger for people on Earth. That invisible problem is carbon dioxide, and too much of it in the atmosphere is what drives climate change. Carbon dioxide comes from the fossil fuel energy we use, the vehicles we drive and the products we make. And according to NASA, people have raised the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by 50% since the beginning of the 18th century.\n\n\"I think this is our main social environmental challenge for humanity, is how to live on this planet so that not only the benefits that we've enjoyed of a stable climate, of access to fresh water, of you know, not having fires in our neighborhood, that our children and our children's children have those same benefits,\" said Dr. Eugene Cordero, a climatologist at San Jose State University. \"And I think we should be very, very concerned about this.\"\n\nMauna Loa is the largest active volcano on the planet. Located on the Big Island of Hawaii, it towers more than 13,000 ft. above sea level. If it sounds familiar, it recently got a lot of attention for its eruptions and stunning lava flows. The most recent eruption happened in November, for the first time in almost four decades.\n\nWhat may be less known is the Mauna Loa Observatory that sits on the volcano up a narrow one-lane road through a lava field. It's about a 90-minute drive southeast from the city of Kailua-Kona, on the western coast of the island.\n\n\"It's not the easiest place to get to,\" said Aidan Colton, with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, about the observatory that is quite near the top of the volcano. \"It's 11,000-foot elevation. Every time we take a breath of air, you're breathing in a third less oxygen.\"\n\nColton said it is the air that makes this remote location so important. At more than two miles high, it is far above any ground-level pollution from communities below. It is also surrounded by 2,000 miles of open ocean. That means by the time air makes its way to Mauna Loa, it has been blended with air from across the globe.\n\nThe observatory is where scientists for the last 65 years have relied on the carbon dioxide measurements taken to establish how much humans are altering our planet.\n\nColton's job is to take those measurements.  He grabs air samples in two separate ways. The first is by hand, capturing air in pressurized bottles on a weekly basis that are sent to a lab in Colorado for analysis.

        "title": "The majority of Americans support climate reforms. Why won't Congress deliver?\n",
        "text": "Watch CBS News Climate change is a deeply polarizing issue within Congress. The Inflation Reduction Act was hailed as \u201cthe most significant climate action in U.S. history\u201d and provided nearly $400 billion for climate solutions. Congress passed the legislation in 2022 strictly along party lines, with no Republicans voting in favor.  In 2023, Democrats voted for pro-environmental legislation more than 90% of the time. Republicans voted for pro-environmental legislation less than 5% of the time, according to voting data collected by the League of Conservation Voters.  Answer a handful of questions from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication's Climate Change in the American Mind survey to see how your thoughts compare to your neighbor's. And yet, public opinion polling shows support for climate policies in conservative districts. According to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, about two-thirds of Americans are \u201cworried\u201d about climate change. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans support funding research into renewable energy, and 3 out of 4 support regulating carbon emissions. Two-thirds believe Congress should do more to address climate change.  Even in Jack County, Texas, where Donald Trump received 90% of the vote in 2020, 58% support regulating carbon emissions. That\u2019s the lowest of any U.S. county.  So why is there such a disconnect between the American public and Congress?  Marc Arnauch, a third-generation farmer from Colorado, once didn't believe humans could change the climate. \"Earlier in my farming career, I was a naysayer that man couldn't possibly change the climate,\" he said.  But after years of watching nighttime temperatures rise and rainfall patterns shift, Arnauch couldn't deny the impact climate change was having on his crops.  In Arnauch's congressional district, two-thirds are worried about climate change, 79% support funding research into renewable energy and 73% support regulating carbon emissions.  Still, when election season comes around, climate isn't his top concern. He plans to vote for Rep. Lauren Boebert, even though she's been an outspoken opponent of climate policies, famously dismissing the issue by claiming, \"climate change occurs four times a year,\" referring to the seasons.  For Arnauch, other issues -- like his farm, family and the local economy, which relies heavily on farming and fracking -- take priority.  Arnauch story isn't unique. Lifelong Republican Larry Howe from Texas also finds himself at odds with his party on climate change, even as he agrees on many other issues.  Yale's polling data shows about 64% are worried about climate change in Texas, but Howe doesn't feel like his opinions on climate change align with his party.  At a recent town hall, Howe confronted his congressman, Rep. Pat Fallon, asking whether he would support climate education. Fallon instead urged caution, warning against \"climate alarmism.\"  Texas party leaders, like Dallas GOP Chairman Allen West, have echoed these sentiments, pushing back against \"extreme solutions\" they believe could limit personal freedoms.  But Howe said he will be taking climate into account on election day.  \"If you want my vote, you got to step up on climate and prioritize the issue,\" Howe said. \"If you're not willing to act on something with so much evidence behind it, how can I trust you on other issues?\"  Tony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, this disconnect between climate change and politics is widespread. \"We see pretty much across the board, at all levels of government, that government officials dramatically underestimate the level of support from their own constituents,\" Leiserowitz said. More Yale polling data found global warming ranked 19th among 28 issues listed in deciding a presidential candidate. It was ranked higher among Democratic voters and lower among Republican voters. Republican voters ranked the economy and inflation as the top two issues. \"There's a huge difference between voter preferences and voter priorities. And, you know, politicians have limited time and limited money and a limited ability to communicate with voters,\" said Nathaniel Stinnett, the founder and director of the Environmental Voter Project. In California, a state that typically leads the way in environmental laws and regulations, some local officials are cautious about changing too much too fast. Surprisingly some Democratic lawmakers are voting against environmental legislation, despite widespread public support for climate action. California Assemblymember Blanca Rubio said her votes reflect the financial realities her constituents face, not climate denial. \"Not every community can afford whatever policy we pass,\" Rubio said, pointing to the state's clean car regulations, which bans the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Experts warn that the state may not have the infrastructure to support the shift. \"A lot of times, we vote on bills based on hopes and dreams,\" Rubio said. Jobs are also a key issue. While clean energy jobs now make up more than half of California's energy workforce, fossil fuel jobs pay, on average, 50% more due to stronger unions. State Sen. Melissa Hurtado, who represents the state's largest oil-producing region, supports reducing emissions but stresses the need to protect local jobs. \"We have to think about what's going to keep our economy going and keep people employed,\" Hurtado said. While California Democrats may feel some climate policies are hurting their constituents, across the country many districts are seeing millions of dollars in investment and new jobs because of climate policy. This is especially true in conservative congressional districts where all representatives voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. Nearly two-thirds of the projects, more than two-thirds of the jobs and more than 80% of the money invested in projects taking advantage of the legislation's tax credits have been in Republican-represented congressional districts, according to data collected by E2, which has tracked project announcements since the bill's passing. Additionally, almost 3.5 million Americans worked in clean energy by the end of 2023 according to an analysis of federal data by E2. Clean energy jobs represented more than half of all new energy jobs in 2023. Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, a Republican who represents a coastal district particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme storms like Hurricane Debby, voted against the act.  His district, however, is gaining 4,500 new green jobs and $3.5 billion in investments from the legislation. Carter said that his opposition stemmed from a provision in the IRA that lowers the cost of prescription drugs.  Still, Carter insists he aligns with his constituents' views.  \"I represent the entire coast of Georgia, and we love our environment,\" he said.  Yet, he has voted against environmental measures 96% of the time, according to the League of Conservation Voters, even as 53% of his district's residents express concern about climate change. Carter, the vice-chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus, which includes more than 80 Republicans who acknowledge climate change but all voted against the IRA, expressed uncertainty about its causes. \"I'm not a scientist in that realm, so I don't know what it could be, but I suspect it could be just natural phenomena,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not one of those who subscribes to the theory that if we don't fix it by the day after tomorrow, we're all going to fry. But I do believe we should address it.\" Another reason for the disconnect between voters and elected officials when it comes to climate change is the oil and gas industry. It spent $72 million on federal lobbying in the first half of 2024 alone, as the EPA introduced some of its toughest regulations to reduce fossil fuel emissions. This spending is on track to surpass the $133 million spent in 2023.  \"There's the existence of a very powerful lobby, mostly the fossil fuel industry, that is absolutely fighting tooth and nail to try to maintain their hold over our energy system,\" said Yale's Tony Leiserowitz. Research from Harvard University revealed that ExxonMobil accurately predicted climate change in the 1970s but never shared its findings. Today, Exxon leads the oil and gas lobbying efforts, ranking among the top 20 lobbyists across all industries, having spent $300 million since 1998. The industry has also donated more than $400 million to congressional campaigns since 1998, with about 80% of that going to Republican members.  \"These older companies are holding onto the past because it benefits their profits. They've had massive influence on politics, from the local to national level,\" Leiserowitz explained. Nathaniel Stinnett, from the Environmental Voter Project, said his organization focuses on \"finding people who care deeply about climate in the environment, who don't vote, and then turning them into better voters,\" Stinnett said.  This strategy has the potential to influence election outcomes. The Environmental Voter Project identified significant numbers of climate voters in key battleground states: 250,000 in Pennsylvania, 230,000 in Arizona and 490,000 in Georgia. Given the narrow margins in these states during the 2020 election, these voters could be decisive.  Researchers at the University of Colorado studied the 2016 and 2020 elections and found that 77% of voters - including moderates - consider climate change \"somewhat\" or \"very\" important supported Democrats. In 2020, these voters overwhelmingly backed Biden.  The researchers also found that climate change opinions boosted Biden's popular vote by 3%, enough to give him the edge over Trump in the 2020 election.  \"We know the policies needed to tackle the climate crisis. We know the technologies that should be adopted more quickly. We understand how utilities and energy consumption must change. The answers are there, but what often stands in the way is a lack of political will for politicians to enact these solutions,\" Stinnett said.

Republicans voted for pro-environmental legislation less than 5% of the time, according to voting data collected by the League of Conservation Voters.\n\nAnd yet, public opinion polling shows support for climate policies in conservative districts. According to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, about two-thirds of Americans are \u201cworried\u201d about climate change. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans support funding research into renewable energy, and 3 out of 4 support regulating carbon emissions. Two-thirds believe Congress should do more to address climate change.\n\nEven in Jack County, Texas, where Donald Trump received 90% of the vote in 2020, 58% support regulating carbon emissions. That\u2019s the lowest of any U.S. county.\n\nSo why is there such a disconnect between the American public and Congress?\n\nMarc Arnauch, a third-generation farmer from Colorado, once didn't believe humans could change the climate. \"Earlier in my farming career, I was a naysayer that man couldn't possibly change the climate,\" he said.\n\nBut after years of watching nighttime temperatures rise and rainfall patterns shift, Arnauch couldn't deny the impact climate change was having on his crops.\n\nIn Arnauch's congressional district, two-thirds are worried about climate change, 79% support funding research into renewable energy and 73% support regulating carbon emissions.\n\nStill, when election season comes around, climate isn't his top concern. He plans to vote for Rep. Lauren Boebert, even though she's been an outspoken opponent of climate policies, famously dismissing the issue by claiming, \"climate change occurs four times a year,\" referring to the seasons.\n\nFor Arnauch, other issues -- like his farm, family and the local economy, which relies heavily on farming and fracking -- take priority.\n\nArnauch story isn't unique. Lifelong Republican Larry Howe from Texas also finds himself at odds with his party on climate change, even as he agrees on many other issues.\n\nYale's polling data shows about 64% are worried about climate change in Texas, but Howe doesn't feel like his opinions on climate change align with his party.\n\nAt a recent town hall, Howe confronted his congressman, Rep. Pat Fallon, asking whether he would support climate education. Fallon instead urged caution, warning against \"climate alarmism.\"\n\nTexas party leaders, like Dallas GOP Chairman Allen West, have echoed these sentiments, pushing back against \"extreme solutions\" they believe could limit personal freedoms.\n\nBut Howe said he will be taking climate into account on election day.\n\n\"If you want my vote, you got to step up on climate and prioritize the issue,\" Howe said. \"If you're not willing to act on something with so much evidence behind it, how can I trust you on other issues?\"\n\nTony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, this disconnect between climate change and politics is widespread. \"We see pretty much across the board, at all levels of government, that government officials dramatically underestimate the level of support from their own constituents,\" Leiserowitz said.\n\nMore Yale polling data found global warming ranked 19th among 28 issues listed in deciding a presidential candidate. It was ranked higher among Democratic voters and lower among Republican voters. Republican voters ranked the economy and inflation as the top two issues.\n\n\"There's a huge difference between voter preferences and voter priorities. And, you know, politicians have limited time and limited money and a limited ability to communicate with voters,\" said Nathaniel Stinnett, the founder and director of the Environmental Voter Project.\n\nIn California, a state that typically leads the way in environmental laws and regulations, some local officials are cautious about changing too much too fast.\n\nSurprisingly some Democratic lawmakers are voting against environmental legislation, despite widespread public support for climate action.\n\nCalifornia Assemblymember Blanca Rubio said her votes reflect the financial realities her constituents face, not climate denial. \"Not every community can afford whatever policy we pass,\" Rubio said, pointing to the state's clean car regulations, which bans the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.\n\nExperts warn that the state may not have the infrastructure to support the shift.\n\n\"A lot of times, we vote on bills based on hopes and dreams,\" Rubio said.\n\nJobs are also a key issue. While clean energy jobs now make up more than half of California's energy workforce, fossil fuel jobs pay, on average, 50% more due to stronger unions.\n\nState Sen. Melissa Hurtado, who represents the state's largest oil-producing region, supports reducing emissions but stresses the need to protect local jobs.\n\n\"We have to think about what's going to keep our economy going and keep people employed,\" Hurtado said.\n\nWhile California Democrats may feel some climate policies are hurting their constituents, across the country many districts are seeing millions of dollars in investment and new jobs because of climate policy.\n\nThis is especially true in conservative congressional districts where all representatives voted against the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the projects, more than two-thirds of the jobs and more than 80% of the money invested in projects taking advantage of the legislation's tax credits have been in Republican-represented congressional districts, according to data collected by E2, which has tracked project announcements since the bill's passing.\n\nAdditionally, almost 3.5 million Americans worked in clean energy by the end of 2023 according to an analysis of federal data by E2.\n\nClean energy jobs represented more than half of all new energy jobs in 2023.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Buddy Carter, a Republican who represents a coastal district particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme storms like Hurricane Debby, voted against the act.\n\nHis district, however, is gaining 4,500 new green jobs and $3.5 billion in investments from the legislation.\n\nCarter said that his opposition stemmed from a provision in the IRA that lowers the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nStill, Carter insists he aligns with his constituents' views.\n\n\"I represent the entire coast of Georgia, and we love our environment,\" he said.\n\nYet, he has voted against environmental measures 96% of the time, according to the League of Conservation Voters, even as 53% of his district's residents express concern about climate change.\n\nCarter, the vice-chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus, which includes more than 80 Republicans who acknowledge climate change but all voted against the IRA, expressed uncertainty about its causes.\n\n\"I'm not a scientist in that realm, so I don't know what it could be, but I suspect it could be just natural phenomena,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not one of those who subscribes to the theory that if we don't fix it by the day after tomorrow, we're all going to fry. But I do believe we should address it.\"\n\nAnother reason for the disconnect between voters and elected officials when it comes to climate change is the oil and gas industry.\n\nIt spent $72 million on federal lobbying in the first half of 2024 alone, as the EPA introduced some of its toughest regulations to reduce fossil fuel emissions.\n\nThis spending is on track to surpass the $133 million spent in 2023.\n\n\"There's the existence of a very powerful lobby, mostly the fossil fuel industry, that is absolutely fighting tooth and nail to try to maintain their hold over our energy system,\" said Yale's Tony Leiserowitz.\n\nResearch from Harvard University revealed that ExxonMobil accurately predicted climate change in the 1970s but never shared its findings.\n\nToday, Exxon leads the oil and gas lobbying efforts, ranking among the top 20 lobbyists across all industries, having spent $300 million since 1998.\n\nThe industry has also donated more than $400 million to congressional campaigns since 1998, with about 80% of that going to Republican members.\n\n\"These older companies are holding onto the past because it benefits their profits. They've had massive influence on politics, from the local to national level,\" Leiserowitz explained.\n\nNathaniel Stinnett, from the Environmental Voter Project, said his organization focuses on \"finding people who care deeply about climate in the environment, who don't vote, and then turning them into better voters,\" Stinnett said.\n\nThis strategy has the potential to influence election outcomes.\n\nThe Environmental Voter Project identified significant numbers of climate voters in key battleground states: 250,000 in Pennsylvania, 230,000 in Arizona and 490,000 in Georgia.\n\nGiven the narrow margins in these states during the 2020 election, these voters could be decisive.\n\nResearchers at the University of Colorado studied the 2016 and 2020 elections and found that 77% of voters - including moderates - consider climate change \"somewhat\" or \"very\" important supported Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, these voters overwhelmingly backed Biden.\n\nThe researchers also found that climate change opinions boosted Biden's popular vote by 3%, enough to give him the edge over Trump in the 2020 election.\n\n\"We know the policies needed to tackle the climate crisis. We know the technologies that should be adopted more quickly. We understand how utilities and energy consumption must change. The answers are there, but what often stands in the way is a lack of political will for politicians to enact these solutions,\" Stinnett said.",

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nUpdated on:  April 6, 2023 / 12:27 PM EDT\n          / CBS News\n         How we grow food, consume it and waste it may play a big role in whether the world can avert a climate catastrophe, environmentalists and climate change analysts say. One big obstacle to changing the most damaging practices is that many of them are in fact encouraged and financially incentivized by countries \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 possibly pushing us faster toward a world that's too dangerously warm. \"If we do everything right \u2014 if we reduce energy-related emissions [and] transportation-related emissions as much as we all need, and we don't address emissions from agriculture, we are still not going to avoid a climate catastrophe,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. The global food system \u2014 the growing, processing, transporting, distributing, consumption and disposal of food \u2014 makes up\u00a0a third\u00a0of greenhouse gas emissions every year. From cutting down trees for grazing cattle, to food waste in landfills, each stage of the food system creates greenhouse gases: a\u00a0study published in March estimated that emissions from food production and waste alone could push global temperatures up by as much as 1.1 degrees Celsius (1.98 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.\u00a0 Methane is the second biggest greenhouse gas producer after carbon dioxide, and it's 25 times as powerful as CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Overall, high-methane foods are on track to make up more than 80% of food-related warming by 2100.  Livestock and agriculture are big methane producers \u2014 particularly cattle and rice. Manure and gas from cows is rich in methane, as are rice paddies, which emit the gas after they're flooded.\u00a0 In the U.S., perhaps the most influential factor in agriculture policy affecting climate change is the farm bill, a massive, contentious measure that sets agriculture policies and regulations. It's passed by Congress every five years and is up for renewal this year.\u00a0 The Environmental Working Group (EWG) published an\u00a0analysis\u00a0of U.S. agriculture spending from 2017-2020, a period during which the environmental quality incentives program of the farm bill provided more than $3.6 billion of funding to farmer. But EWG found that just 23% of incentive payments \"were for practices that mitigate climate change,\" according to the Agriculture Department's own list of \"climate-smart practices and enhancements.\" Some of those climate-smart practices include converting manure into organic fertilizer, improving soil health by increasing plant diversity and minimizing soil disturbance.\u00a0 But implementing new and climate-friendly practices may be costly and adversely affect yield, cutting into farmers' bottom lines and making their crops or herds less attractive to investors and buyers. That reality, according to the\u00a0World Economic Forum, has resulted in a cycle in the U.S. that rewards \"the systems that are least regenerative, emit the most greenhouse gases, and result in the most land degradation.\" These damaging systems, the World Economic Forum said, \"are the most likely to have access to capital.\" The EWG analysis found that the majority of environmental quality incentives program practices funded by the farm bill were for structures, equipment or facilities that were not even on the department's \"climate-smart\" list, and further some of the items receiving the most funding, like waste storage facilities, which are used for manure, actually increase methane emissions, a point that has been acknowledged by the Agriculture Department. The department has a list of climate-friendly alternatives for managing cattle waste, among them, the use of microbes to anaerobically digest manure or composting, but all of these approaches come with attendant costs or labor. Globally, leaders have agreed to dramatically decrease agriculture sector emissions. In 2021, 111 countries, making up 45% of global methane emissions,\u00a0signed an agreement\u00a0to reduce methane emissions 30% by 2030, and 145 countries signed on to\u00a0reverse deforestation \u2014 which is mostly caused by cattle ranching \u2014 by 2030.\u00a0 In 2015,196 parties adopted the international\u00a0Paris Agreement to\u00a0keep global average temperatures from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) as compared to pre-Industrial times. But since then, average global temperatures have already increased by at least 1.1 degrees Celsius; meaning, emissions related to our food system alone would push warming past the agreement's ceiling. \"When people think about climate the focus usually snaps to fossil fuels, renewable energy, and that makes sense because it's the leading driver [of emissions], but food is this super underappreciated part of it. We eat three times a day, so it's something that we can actually do something about,\" said Richard Waite, senior research associate of the World Resources Institute's food and climate programs.\u00a0 The role of the global food system in producing greenhouse gas emissions has not been fully recognized by much of the world. Only a third of the 194 countries that signed the Paris Agreement reference food-system mitigation measures in their climate goals.\u00a0 There have been climate-focused food system bills passed in Washington outside of the farm bill. In January, President Joe Biden signed the Food Donation Improvement Act, which promised to reduce food waste and insecurity. But the bill, Faber said, is just one example of congressional action that is too \"incremental.\"\u00a0 Amanda Little, a food systems expert at Vanderbilt University agrees that more action is required beyond the Food Donation Improvement Act, but she praised the legislation in a Bloomberg opinion piece, as an important step toward resolving \"the gross contradiction between food excess and food scarcity in America.\" She pointed out that the new law will make it much easier for businesses, schools, farms and markets to donate their large surpluses of food directly to communities that need it by relieving them of liabilities related to food quality or spoilage. Previously, Little points out, they were required to make their food donations indirectly \u2014 to food banks that might be far away \u2014 and the food bank would then redistribute the food, a practice that in many cases was so impractical that it was just easier to throw away the extra food, instead of dealing with the logistics of donating it. The U.S., historically the world's largest emitter, does not mention curbing food waste in its latest emissions targets, even though nearly 40% of all food is wasted here. The U.S. should be leading the way on this issue, says Pete Pearson, of the World Wildlife Fund: \"We've got to have food loss and waste linked to our climate goals, period.\" And environmentalists worry that change is not happening fast enough, says Waite. He said that in some cases, mitigation measures need to be moving \"five to six times\" faster than current trends in order to meet global climate goals. Last year, the World Resources Institute published a study that examined the world's progress in meeting climate goals. In the food and agriculture sector, WRI found that ruminant meat productivity trends \u2014 that is, the meat of cattle, sheep and goats \u2014 were \"off track\" and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production were moving in the \"wrong direction.\" Meat consumption is on the rise across the globe. As more wealth is created in emerging economies, such as China and Brazil, more meat is eaten, and the U.S. consumes more meat than any other country.\u00a0 For years, studies and media reports have encouraged more plant-heavy diets and less red meat, arguing the shift could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in Nature found that if diets globally were limited to one serving of red meat per week and all other animal protein to two servings per day, global warming due to food consumption would decrease by 0.19\u2009\u00b0C by the end of the century.

        "lede_skeptic_llama": "As the world struggles to transition to renewable energy, a lesser-known driver of greenhouse gas emissions is gaining attention: the global food system, which accounts for a third of emissions and could single-handedly push global temperatures past the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree Celsius limit, sparking concerns that even a rapid shift to clean energy won't be enough to avert a climate catastrophe. The issue is particularly pressing given that current agricultural practices and policies in the U.S. and elsewhere are often at odds with climate goals, prioritizing productivity and profit over sustainability, and potentially undermining efforts to reduce emissions. With the U.S. farm bill up for renewal this year, the debate is heating up over how to reform a system that is both a major contributor to climate change and a vital part of the global economy.",
        "lede_neutral_gpt": "In a world increasingly beset by climate concerns, the global food system emerges as a surprising yet critical player in the battle to avert disaster, as environmentalists spotlight its staggering contribution of one-third of annual greenhouse gas emissions. Despite pledges from global leaders to curtail emissions, many agricultural practices that exacerbate the climate crisis remain financially incentivized, perpetuating systems that degrade land and intensify warming. With the U.S. farm bill up for renewal, activists warn that without urgent reforms acknowledging agriculture's role in methane production, even the most robust reductions in energy and transportation emissions could still leave the world dangerously warm.",
        "lede_skeptic_gpt": "As the global temperature continues its perilous ascent, skeptics of renewable energy may find an unexpected culprit in the looming climate crisis: our food system. According to recent analyses, traditional agricultural practices \u2014 backed by lucrative incentives \u2014 are not just resistant to change but are actively contributing to a third of annual greenhouse gas emissions worldwide. Despite advancements in renewable energy, experts warn that without addressing emissions from the food sector, particularly those encouraged by policies like the U.S. farm bill, we may be hastening towards environmental disaster."

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nMay 1, 2025 / 11:13 PM EDT\n          / CBS News\n         The Senate on Thursday approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule tied to the Clean Air Act and designed to limit seven of the most hazardous air pollutants that are emitted by heavy industry. The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time in the 55-year history of the Clean Air Act that Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law. Senate Republicans utilized the Congressional Review Act to overturn the regulation, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2024. The joint resolution now goes to the Republican-led House, where it also expected to pass. The rule\u00a0tied to the Clean Air Act\u00a0was finalized last year to close a loophole that required all \"major\" sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called \"Once in, Always In.\" The rule requires that industrial facilities \u2014 often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution \u2014 always maintain strict pollution controls. Even if they comply and limit those pollution levels, those facilities would always be labeled \"major\" sources under the rule. The Trump Administration had killed the rule in President Trump's first term, but the EPA, under former President Joe Biden, finalized and updated it last September. The environmental advocacy group Earthjustice has said that\u00a0the rule forced 1,800 facilities across the country\u00a0to tighten air pollution controls to comply with the law. The seven pollutants in question are: Several Republican lawmakers have been attempting to revoke the rule. Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah introduced\u00a0the resolution\u00a0which passed Thursday. Curtis had argued that the rule disincentivized companies to deploy new technology to reduce pollution. \"The rule put forward under the former administration shut the door on progress,\" Curtis said in a statement after the resolution's passage. \"It told companies that no matter how much they invest to reduce harmful emissions, they would still be punished with permanent red tape. That's not good science, it's not good governance, and it certainly isn't good for the environment. My resolution restores a common-sense incentive: if you clean up, you get credit for it.\" Several environmental groups, however, blasted the move. \"Today, I worry for children's health more than ever before,\" Melody Reis, director of federal policy for\u00a0Moms Clean Air Force, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Just now Senate Republicans voted to hand a couple of thousand of the nation's largest industrial polluters an easy way to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer, birth defects, and brain damage. They voted to allow chemical manufacturers, pesticide makers, refineries and other facilities to turn off their pollution controls for the most insidious air pollutants known to humankind \u2014 chemicals such as dioxins, mercury, and PCBs. This will put our children, and all of us, at grave risk. It is a shameful, and completely unnecessary move.\" \u00a0 Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, which is made up of former EPA staffers, said in his own statement, \"Congress should be strengthening EPA's ability to protect the public from mercury, benzene, and other dangerous emissions, not stripping away rules that hold polluters accountable.\" The vote marks a major victory for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, which had lobbied against the \"Once in, Always In\" rule for some time. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group,\u00a0sent a letter to Mr. Trump\u00a0after his inauguration calling the rule \"burdensome,\" and listing it as one of several environmental regulations that are \"strangling our economy\" and should be reversed.

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nMay 17, 2022 / 8:37 PM EDT\n          / AP\n         A new study blames pollution of all types for 9 million deaths a year globally, with the death toll attributed to dirty air from cars, trucks and industry rising 55% since 2000. That increase is offset by fewer pollution deaths from primitive indoor stoves and water contaminated with human and animal waste, so overall pollution deaths in 2019 are about the same as 2015. The United States is the only fully industrialized country in the top 10 nations for total pollution deaths, ranking 7th with 142,883 deaths blamed on pollution in 2019, sandwiched between Bangladesh and Ethiopia, according to a new study in the journal\u00a0The Lancet Planetary Health.\u00a0 Tuesday's pre-pandemic study is based on calculations derived from the Global Burden of Disease database and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. India and China lead the world in pollution deaths with nearly 2.4 million and almost 2.2 million deaths a year, but the two nations also have the world's largest populations. When deaths are put on a per population rate, the United States ranks 31st from the bottom at 43.6 pollution deaths per 100,000. Chad and the Central African Republic rank the highest with rates at about 300 pollution deaths per 100,000, more than half of them due to tainted water, while Brunei, Qatar and Iceland have the lowest pollution death rates ranging from 15 to 23. The global average is 117 pollution deaths per 100,000 people. Pollution kills about the same number of people a year around the world as cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke combined, the study said. \"Nine million deaths is a lot of deaths,\" said Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program and Global Pollution Observatory at Boston College. \"The bad news is that it's not decreasing,\" Landrigan said. \"We're making gains in the easy stuff and we're seeing the more difficult stuff, which is the ambient (outdoor industrial) air pollution and the chemical pollution, still going up.\" It doesn't have to be this way, researchers said. \"They are preventable deaths. Each and every one of them is a death that is unnecessary,\" said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Public Health, who wasn't part of the study. She said the calculations made sense and, if anything, the study was conservative about what it attributed to pollution \u2014 the real death toll is likely higher. The certificates for these deaths don't say pollution. They list heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, other lung issues and diabetes that are \"tightly correlated\" with pollution by numerous epidemiological studies, Landrigan said. To then put these together with actual deaths, researchers look at the number of deaths by cause, exposure to pollution weighted for various factors, and then complicated exposure response calculations derived by large epidemiological studies based on thousands of people over decades of study, he said. It's the same way scientists can say cigarettes cause cancer and heart disease deaths. \"That cannon of information constitutes causality,\" Landrigan said. \"That's how we do it.\" Five outside experts in public health and air pollution, including Goldman, told The Associated Press the study follows mainstream scientific thought. Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency room doctor and Harvard professor who wasn't part of the study, said \"the American Heart Association determined over a decade ago that exposure to (tiny pollution particles) like that generated from the burning of fossil fuels is causal for heart disease and death.\" \"While people focus on decreasing their blood pressure and cholesterol, few recognize that the removal of air pollution is an important prescription to improve their heart health,\" Salas said. Three-quarters of the overall pollution deaths came from air pollution and the overwhelming part of that is \"a combination of pollution from stationary sources like coal-fired power plants and steel mills on one hand and mobile sources like cars, trucks and buses. And it's just a big global problem,\" said Landrigan, a public health physician. \"And it's getting worse around the world as countries develop and cities grow.\" In New Delhi, India, air pollution peaks in the winter months and last year the city saw just two days when the air wasn't considered polluted. It was the first time in four years that the city experienced a clean air day during the winter months. That air pollution remains the leading cause of death in South Asia reaffirms what is already known, but the increase in these deaths means that toxic emissions from vehicles and energy generation is increasing, said Anumita Roychowdhury, a director at the advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. \"This data is a reminder of what is going wrong but also that it is an opportunity to fix it,\" Roychowdhury said. Pollution deaths are soaring in the poorest areas, experts said. \"This problem is worst in areas of the world where population is most dense (e.g. Asia) and where financial and government resources to address the pollution problem are limited and stretched thin to address a host of challenges including health care availability and diet as well as pollution,\" said Dan Greenbaum, president of the Health Effects Institute, who wasn't part of the study. In 2000, industrial air pollution killed about 2.9 million people a year globally. By 2015 it was up to 4.2 million and in 2019 it was 4.5 million, the study said. Toss in household air pollution, mostly from inefficient primitive stoves, and air pollution killed 6.7 million people in 2019, the study found. Lead pollution \u2014 some from lead additive which has been banned from gasoline in every country in the world and also from old paint, recycling batteries and other manufacturing \u2014 kills 900,000 people a year, while water pollution is responsible for 1.4 million deaths a year. Occupational health pollution adds another 870,000 deaths, the study said. In the United States, about 20,000 people a year die from lead pollution-induced hypertension, heart disease and kidney disease, mostly as occupational hazards, Landrigan said. Lead and asbestos are America's big chemical occupational hazards, and they kill about 65,000 people a year from pollution, he said. The study said the number of air pollution deaths in the United States in 2019 was 60,229, far more than deaths on American roads, which hit a 16-year peak of nearly 43,000 last year. Modern types of pollution are rising in most countries, especially developing ones, but fell from 2000 to 2019 in the United States, the European Union and Ethiopia. Ethiopia's numbers can't quite be explained and may be a reporting issue, said study co-author Richard Fuller, founder of the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution and president of Pure Earth, a non-profit that works on pollution clean-up programs in about a dozen countries. The study authors came up with eight recommendations to reduce pollution deaths, highlighting the need for better monitoring, better reporting and stronger government systems regulating industry and cars. \"We absolutely know how to solve each one of those problems,\" Fuller said. \"What's missing is political will.\" \n\u00a9 2022 The Associated Press.

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nUpdated on:  February 17, 2021 / 8:50 PM EST\n          / CBS News\n         As the Earth continues to warm, climate disasters are getting more extreme. In 2020, the impact was on vivid display with record-shattering\u00a0wildfires in the western U.S. and the historic Atlantic hurricane season.\u00a0 Destroying homes and livelihoods, these types of events often act as triggers, leaving people with little choice but to move, especially if they were already socially or economically vulnerable. This phenomenon is called climate migration and it is becoming more common because of human-caused climate change.\u00a0 This past autumn we witnessed the beginning of what may be one of the most straightforward examples of climate-induced migration in Central America. Around 10,000 people have already attempted to migrate northward after two devastating storms hit, and many more are planning to leave soon. In November, Hurricane Eta and Hurricane Iota, both catastrophic Category 4 hurricanes, made landfall two weeks and only 15 miles apart, near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua. They were two of the most intense storms of the most active Atlantic hurricane season in recorded history.\u00a0 With winds of 150 mph and devastating flooding from torrential rains, the storms impacted 6 million people, destroyed thousands of homes and displaced nearly 600,000 in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. With little to no government assistance, many of those displaced are living in shelters with little food. As of early January, the Red Cross reported 250,000 were still in emergency shelters throughout the region. It's not only housing and food that are in short supply; many people have also lost their livelihoods. The Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock in Honduras estimates that up to 80% of the agricultural sector was decimated by the storms \u2014 an industry that, as of 2020, provided one-third of the country's employment. With few options at home, in mid-January up to 9,000 people gathered\u00a0to join a caravan in Honduras heading to Mexico and the United States in search of opportunity. A CBS News crew caught up with a few of the migrants in Honduras. We asked why they made the risky choice to leave their country and families behind. Marlin Oviedo, a father of three, told us: \"There is no employment, there is nothing. Because we work in agriculture and you saw the two hurricanes that damaged all the crops, we have nothing. We have to go out and find what we can offer our children, because we have nothing.\" Holding back tears, Oviedo said he felt he had no choice. \"I am leaving three girls behind \u2014 a 4-year old girl, a 12-year-old with special needs, and a 16-year-old. And it hurts me to leave, but I believe I have to.\" It is unclear if Oviedo made it. As the caravan crossed into Guatemala, the group clashed with the Guatemalan military, which\u00a0broke up the caravan\u00a0and sent many of the would-be migrants back to Honduras. \"If people feel their lives are in jeopardy, there's nothing that will deter them from fleeing to safety,\" explained Michael Chertoff, the former Secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush, in an October interview with CBS News. He said massive dislocation caused by people's inability to live in certain areas, due to climate change and socioeconomic factors, is one of his biggest international security concerns. In 2019, the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) calculated that weather-related disasters, some of them tied to climate change, displaced almost 24 million people around the globe \u2014 about three times more than those displaced by conflict that year. These disasters included unprecedented back-to-back cyclones in Mozambique,\u00a0Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas, and the wildfires in California.\u00a0 The record-breaking\u00a02020 Atlantic hurricane season is just another example of how climate change is making weather events more extreme, driving people to migrate from their homes. While hurricanes in the western Caribbean are common during the fall, Eta and Iota were remarkably strong for so late in the season. The intensity of these storms was fueled by some of the warmest water in the Northern Hemisphere, enhanced by human-caused climate change. As the image below shows, since the 1980s water temperatures in the Caribbean have been steadily increasing. The Atlantic overall has warmed more than 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the early 1900s. In the below tweet from British climate scientist Richard Dixon, the map shows (in yellow) how water temperatures in the Caribbean are surpassing 83 degrees Fahrenheit more often.  This warmer water provides high-octane fuel to supercharge storms, taking run-of-the-mill hurricanes and making them into monsters like Eta and Iota. \u00a0 Resending clearer version of this animation that shows the % of weeks, decadally, in November, where mean SSTs > 28.5c in the Atlantic. Can see how much the sea off the coast of Nicaragua has become so much more prone to high SSTs. Would #Iota have deepened as much in the 1980s? pic.twitter.com/trHQUAWY7y This matters because while much of the infrastructure in Central America may be able to withstand the force of typical hurricanes, major hurricanes are often too much to bear. In Honduras alone, more than 85,000 homes\u00a0were damaged in the two storms. NOAA estimates that 85% of all damage from hurricanes comes from the strongest storms \u2014 major Category 3, 4 or 5 systems. Kayly Ober, senior advocate and program manager of the Climate Displacement Program at Refugees International, says the 2019 disasters, as well as hurricanes Eta and Iota, are examples of \"sudden-onset\" events. She fears these types of events, and the migrations that follow, are a sign of things to come. \"Sudden-onset events such as these will only increase in intensity and frequency in the future,\" she said. But she explains that migration caused by these climate events doesn't happen in isolation \u2014 it's often tied to a community's existing vulnerability and inability to adapt. \"Climate change impacts and socioeconomic issues are heavily intertwined.\" Angel Munoz, a climate scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society at Columbia University, agrees. He noted that many people in these communities were dealing with chronic poverty, crime and other difficulties before disaster struck. \"These people were already struggling, even without any hurricane or drought. They are already struggling to survive,\" Munoz said. Sudden-onset events are often the straw that breaks the camel's back, and like Ober, Munoz expects climate-triggered migration events will escalate in a warmer future.\u00a0 But it's not only sudden climate events like Eta and Iota that are causing hardship and driving migration from Central America.\u00a0 \"Slow-onset events, such as prolonged drought, have been affecting the ability of many people on the edge for years in the region, particularly in the so-called Dry Corridor, which runs from Southern Mexico to Costa Rica,\" explained Ober.\u00a0 The U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization estimates that 3.5 million people in the region have faced food insecurity in the past 10 years due to recurring droughts, driven by natural climate variability and climate change. The Climate Reality Project does a good job of explaining how these climate shifts helped lead to high rates of migration in 2018. Whether it be slow-onset events like drought, or sudden-onset events like hurricanes, what we are witnessing is just the tip of the iceberg as a hotter Earth means more extreme weather. We are already seeing evidence of the impacts. A recent\u00a0report by Refugees International says, \"The trends are clear\u2014sudden-onset disasters are becoming more frequent and intense; disasters are leading to protracted displacement.\" And the World Bank predicts that unchecked carbon emissions could lead to 143 million internal climate migrants by 2050 in Latin America, the Caribbean, South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.\u00a0 With the threat of increased climate migration in mind, President Biden recently signed an executive order on \"Rebuilding and Enhancing Programs to Resettle Refugees and Planning for the Impact of Climate Change on Migration,\" which orders federal agencies to prepare and submit a report on climate change and its impact on migration. Mr. Biden directed that the report must include discussion of the international security implications of climate-related migration\u00a0and options for protection and resettlement of individuals displaced directly or indirectly from climate change.\u00a0 This is an important step for those forced to flee their countries due to climate change. That's because the U.N.'s\u00a01951 Refugee Convention does not cover climate-related migration. It defines refugees as those who are outside their country of origin and have a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a social group. Because this definition does not address migration resulting from climate change, those people have not been able to obtain international protection.\u00a0 The Refugees International report praises the initial steps of the Biden administration and argues that \"the United States has a moral and practical responsibility to lead on issues of climate change, migration, and displacement\" because the U.S. has been responsible for the largest share of heat-trapping fossil fuel emissions over time.\u00a0 \"We need to realize that climate change impacts are already influencing decisions to migrate today, and ensure that people moving are able to access safe and dignified pathways in their own country and abroad,\" said Ober. It will take financial commitment to help reduce the risk of disaster, adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience. Ober believes the United States and its allies should step up financing for existing international aid funds, such as the Green Climate Fund, which was created by the U.N. to help developing countries reduce emissions and enhance their resilience to climate change.\u00a0 In fact, in its\u00a0report, the World Bank predicts that robust action on cutting carbon emissions and supporting a green transition could reduce the total number of climate migrants by 50% to 80% \u2014 that's 31 to 72 million people \u2014 by 2050.\u00a0 But without a comprehensive plan to reel in carbon emissions and effective policies to deal with the growing threat of climate migration, Ober fears many more people will be forced to flee.\u00a0 \"I am concerned that climate change impacts will only increase in frequency and intensity, and that without proper support or policy intervention, people will have to make the difficult to decision to move.\" Jeff Berardelli is a meteorologist and climate specialist for CBS News. \n\u00a9 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nSeptember 19, 2022 / 8:05 AM EDT\n          / MoneyWatch\n         As Wall Street banks and investors face mounting pressure to disinvest in\u00a0fossil fuels, the massive private equity industry is taking their place, according to climate activists. The eight largest buyout firms have put nearly as much money into coal, oil and gas as the big banks, according to a recent analysis from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project and Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF). The firms, which include Apollo Global Management, Blackstone Group, Brookfield Asset Management, Carlyle Group, KKR and Warbug Pincus, collectively oversee $216 billion worth of fossil-fuel assets \u2014 on par with how much money big banks put into fossil fuels last year, the nonprofit groups found. Looking at the 10 largest private equity funds, it found that 80% of their energy investments were in fossil fuels.\u00a0 \"The billions of dollars private equity firms have deployed to drill, frack, transport, store, refine fossil fuels and generate energy, stand in stark contrast to what climate scientists and international policymakers have called upon to align our trajectory to the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming scenario,\" states the\u00a0report, which was cosigned by major climate groups including Greenpeace, Natural Resources Defense Project, Sierra Club and the Sunrise Project.  As banks, utilities and other public companies offload polluting assets, private equity firms are \"emerging as pollution financiers of last resort,\" Oscar Vald\u00e9s Viera, research manager at AFREF, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These  polluting assets are shifting from the public markets, where there is  greater amount of regulatory and public scrutiny, into the shadows of  our financial industry, where private equity usually operates,\" said  Riddhi Mehta-Neugebauer, research director at the Private Equity  Stakeholder Project.  For instance, New Jersey-based utility PSEG, which has a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2030, recently sold 13 fossil-fuel power plants to ArcLight Capital Partners, a private equity firm. Brookfield Asset Management recently bought oil pipelines in Canada and liquefied natural gas facilities in Louisiana. Warburg Pincus, through Citizen Energy, purchased oil and gas wells in Oklahoma. KKR, through subsidiaries, is invested in oil and gas production in Texas, Utah and Canada.\u00a0 The Blackstone Group \u2014 one of the world's largest private equity funds \u2014 is also one of the worst polluters, according to the report. It notes that Blackstone-backed power plants produced 18.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020, the same as 4 million gasoline-burning cars.\u00a0 Warburg Pincus and KKR disputed their portrayal in the report, which they said incorrectly attributed assets they don't own. In a statement, Brookfield said, \"We are proud to be one of the world's largest renewable energy operators and manager of the world's largest climate impact fund,\" and noted that it plans to achieve net-zero emissions in its portfolio by 2050.\u00a0  Blackstone did not respond to a request for comment from CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0 While some PE firms have promised to eliminate carbon, environmentalists say they could be moving much more quickly.\u00a0 Carlyle Group, which earlier this year pledged to have net-zero emissions by 2050, still maintains $24 billion in carbon-based energy through NGP Group, in which it holds a stake, according to the report, which noted that 60% of Carlyle's profit in the first half of this year came from NGP.\u00a0 A Carlyle executive said the company doesn't control NGP's activities, and disagreed with the environmentalists' timeline on how quickly it's possible to retire fossil-fuel plants.\u00a0 \"Carlyle's approach to invest in, not divest from, the energy transition is a different one, grounded in seeking real emissions reductions within portfolio companies over the long term,\" the company said in a statement. \"In order to work toward meaningful progress on climate change, we will continue to partner with companies across the energy spectrum to collect better data and strive for clear progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\" The executive cited several examples of Carlyle's environmental push, noting the company has shut down coal plants under its ownership and pushed oil-and-gas companies Cepsa and Varo Energy to shift to renewables.\u00a0 Carlyle announced in February that it would reach a net-zero portfolio by 2050.

        "onlytext": "As Wall Street banks and investors face mounting pressure to disinvest in fossil fuels, the massive private equity industry is taking their place, according to climate activists. The eight largest buyout firms have put nearly as much money into coal, oil and gas as the big banks, according to a recent analysis from the Private Equity Stakeholder Project and Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund (AFREF). The firms, which include Apollo Global Management, Blackstone Group, Brookfield Asset Management, Carlyle Group, KKR and Warbug Pincus, collectively oversee $216 billion worth of fossil-fuel assets \u2014 on par with how much money big banks put into fossil fuels last year, the nonprofit groups found. Looking at the 10 largest private equity funds, it found that 80% of their energy investments were in fossil fuels.\n\n\"The billions of dollars private equity firms have deployed to drill, frack, transport, store, refine fossil fuels and generate energy, stand in stark contrast to what climate scientists and international policymakers have called upon to align our trajectory to the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming scenario,\" states the report, which was cosigned by major climate groups including Greenpeace, Natural Resources Defense Project, Sierra Club and the Sunrise Project.\n\nAs banks, utilities and other public companies offload polluting assets, private equity firms are \"emerging as pollution financiers of last resort,\" Oscar Vald\u00e9s Viera, research manager at AFREF, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These polluting assets are shifting from the public markets, where there is greater amount of regulatory and public scrutiny, into the shadows of our financial industry, where private equity usually operates,\" said Riddhi Mehta-Neugebauer, research director at the Private Equity Stakeholder Project.\n\nFor instance, New Jersey-based utility PSEG, which has a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2030, recently sold 13 fossil-fuel power plants to ArcLight Capital Partners, a private equity firm. Brookfield Asset Management recently bought oil pipelines in Canada and liquefied natural gas facilities in Louisiana. Warburg Pincus, through Citizen Energy, purchased oil and gas wells in Oklahoma. KKR, through subsidiaries, is invested in oil and gas production in Texas, Utah and Canada.\n\nThe Blackstone Group \u2014 one of the world's largest private equity funds \u2014 is also one of the worst polluters, according to the report. It notes that Blackstone-backed power plants produced 18.1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions in 2020, the same as 4 million gasoline-burning cars.\n\nWarburg Pincus and KKR disputed their portrayal in the report, which they said incorrectly attributed assets they don't own. In a statement, Brookfield said, \"We are proud to be one of the world's largest renewable energy operators and manager of the world's largest climate impact fund,\" and noted that it plans to achieve net-zero emissions in its portfolio by 2050.\n\nBlackstone did not respond to a request for comment from CBS MoneyWatch. \n\nWhile some PE firms have promised to eliminate carbon, environmentalists say they could be moving much more quickly.\n\nCarlyle Group, which earlier this year pledged to have net-zero emissions by 2050, still maintains $24 billion in carbon-based energy through NGP Group, in which it holds a stake, according to the report, which noted that 60% of Carlyle's profit in the first half of this year came from NGP.\n\nA Carlyle executive said the company doesn't control NGP's activities, and disagreed with the environmentalists' timeline on how quickly it's possible to retire fossil-fuel plants.\n\n\"Carlyle's approach to invest in, not divest from, the energy transition is a different one, grounded in seeking real emissions reductions within portfolio companies over the long term,\" the company said in a statement. \"In order to work toward meaningful progress on climate change, we will continue to partner with companies across the energy spectrum to collect better data and strive for clear progress reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\" The executive cited several examples of Carlyle's environmental push, noting the company has shut down coal plants under its ownership and pushed oil-and-gas companies Cepsa and Varo Energy to shift to renewables.\n\nCarlyle announced in February that it would reach a net-zero portfolio by 2050. However, in the past year \u2014 with rising energy prices and now Russia's war in Ukraine \u2014 the fund is focused on energy security as much as sustainability, the executive said. That means keeping natural-gas plants online longer than initially planned.\n\nMore broadly, private equity firms say their investment in thousands of companies around the U.S., including many small and midsize employers, helps sustain struggling businesses and preserve jobs.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Greenhouse gas emissions might have already peaked. Now they need to fall \u2014 fast. Earth is coming out of the hottest year on record, amplifying the destruction from hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, and drought. The oceans remain alarmingly warm, triggering the fourth global coral bleaching event in history. Concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere have reached levels not seen on this planet for millions of years, while humanity\u2019s demand for the fossil fuels that produce this pollution is the highest it has ever been.  Yet at the same time, the world may be closer than ever to turning a corner in the effort to corral climate change.  Last year, more solar panels were installed in China \u2014 the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter \u2014 than the US has installed in its entire history. More electric vehicles were sold worldwide than ever. Energy efficiency is improving. Dozens of countries are widening the gap between their economic growth and their greenhouse gas emissions. And governments stepped up their ambitions to curb their impact on the climate, particularly when it comes to potent greenhouse gases like methane. If these trends continue, global emissions may actually start to decline. Climate Analytics, a think tank, published a report last November that raised the intriguing possibility that the worst of our impact on the climate might be behind us.  \u201cWe find there is a 70% chance that emissions start falling in 2024 if current clean technology growth trends continue and some progress is made to cut non-CO2 emissions,\u201d authors wrote. \u201cThis would make 2023 the year of peak emissions.\u201d \u201cIt was actually a result that surprised us as well,\u201d said Neil Grant, a climate and energy analyst at Climate Analytics and a co-author of the report. \u201cIt\u2019s rare in the climate space that you get good news like this.\u201d The inertia behind this trend toward lower emissions is so immense that even politics can only slow it down, not stop it. Many of the worst-case climate scenarios imagined in past decades are now much less likely.  The United States, the world\u2019s second largest greenhouse gas emitter, has already climbed down from its peak in 2005 and is descending further. In March, Carbon Brief conducted an analysis of how US greenhouse gas emissions would fare under a second Trump or a second Biden administration.  They found that Trump\u2019s stated goals of boosting fossil fuel development and scrapping climate policies would increase US emissions by 4 billion metric tons by 2030. But even under Trump, US emissions are likely to slide downward.  This is a clear sign that efforts to limit climate change are having a durable impact.  However, four months into 2024, it seems unlikely that the world has reached the top of the mountain just yet. Fossil fuel demand is still poised to rise further in part because of more economic growth in developing countries. Technologies like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies are raising overall energy demand as well.  Still, that it\u2019s possible at all to conceive of bending the curve in the near term after more than a century of relentless growth shows that there\u2019s a radical change underway in the relationship between energy, prosperity, and pollution \u2014 that standards of living can go up even as emissions from coal, oil, and gas go down.  Greenhouse gases are not a runaway rocket, but a massive, slow-turning cargo ship. It took decades of technology development, years of global bickering, and billions of dollars to wrench its rudder in the right direction, and it\u2019s unlikely to change course fast enough to meet the most ambitious climate change targets.  But once underway, it will be hard to stop.  Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions have risen in tandem with wealth and an expanding population. Since the 1990s and the 2000s, that direct link has been separated in at least 30 countries, including the US, Singapore, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Their economies have grown while their impact on the climate has shrunk per person. In the past decade, the rate of global carbon dioxide pollution has held fairly level or risen slowly even as the global economy and population has grown by wider margins. Worldwide per capita emissions have also held steady over the past decade.  \u201cWe can be fairly confident that we\u2019ve flattened the curve,\u201d said Michael Lazarus, a senior scientist at SEI US, an environmental think tank, who was not involved in the Climate Analytics study. Still, this means that humanity is adding to the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2014 and doing so at close to its fastest pace ever.  It\u2019s good that this pace is at least not accelerating, but the plateau implies a world that will continue to get warmer. To halt rising temperatures, humans will have to stop emitting greenhouse gases, zeroing their net output, and even start withdrawing the carbon previously emitted. The world thus needs another drastic downward turn in its emissions trajectory to limit climate change. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t get out any balloons or fireworks over flattening emissions,\u201d Lazarus said.  Then there\u2019s the clock. In order to meet the Paris climate agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) on average above pre-industrial temperatures, the world must slash carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. That means power generators, trucks, aircraft, farms, construction sites, home appliances, and manufacturing plants all over the world will have to rapidly clean up.  The current round of international climate commitments puts the planet on track to warm by 5.4\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) by the end of the century. That\u2019s a world in which the likelihood of a major heat wave in a given year would more than double compared to 2.7\u00b0F of warming, where extreme rainfall events would almost double, and more than one in 10 people would face threats from sea level rise.  \u201cThat puts us in this race between the really limited time left to bend the emissions curve and start that project towards zero, but we are also seeing this sort of huge growth, an acceleration in clean technology deployment,\u201d Grant said. \u201cAnd so we wanted to see which of these factors is winning the race at the moment and where we are at.\u201d  Grant and his team mapped out three scenarios. The first is a baseline based on forecasts from the International Energy Agency on how current climate policies and commitments would play out. It shows that fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide emissions would reach a peak this year, but emissions of other heat-trapping gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons would keep rising, so overall greenhouse gas emissions would level off.  The second scenario, dubbed \u201clow effort,\u201d builds on the first, but also assumes that countries will begin to fulfill their promises under agreements like the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane pollution 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 and the Kigali Amendment to phase out HFCs. Under this pathway, total global emissions reach their apex in 2025.  The third scenario imagines a world where clean technology \u2014 renewable energy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency \u2014 continues gaining ground at current rates, outstripping energy demand growth and displacing coal, oil, and natural gas. That would mean greenhouse gases would have already peaked in 2023 and are now on a long, sustained decline.  The stories look different when you zoom in to individual countries, however. While overall emissions are poised to decline, some developing countries will continue to see their output grow while wealthier countries make bigger cuts.  As noted, the US has already climbed down from its peak. China expects to see its emissions curve change directions by 2025. India, the world\u2019s third largest greenhouse gas emitter, may see its emissions grow until 2045.  All three of these pathways anticipate some sort of peak in global emissions before the end of the decade, illustrating that the world has many of the tools it needs to address climate change and that a lot of work in deploying clean energy and cleaning up the biggest polluters is already in progress.  There will still be year-to-year variations from phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o that can raise electricity demand during heat waves or shocks like pandemics that reduce travel or conflicts that force countries to change their energy priorities. But according to the report, the overall trend over decades is still downward.  To be clear, the Carbon Analytics study is one of the more optimistic projections out there, but it\u2019s not that far off from what other groups have found. In its own analysis, the International Energy Agency reports that global carbon dioxide emissions \u201care set to peak this decade.\u201d The consulting firm McKinsey anticipates that greenhouse gases will begin to decline before 2030, also finding that 2023 may have been the apogee.  Global emissions could just as easily shoot back up if governments and companies give up on their goals Within the energy sector, Ember, a think tank, found that emissions might have peaked in 2022. Research firm Rystad Energy expects that fossil fuel emissions will reach their pinnacle in 2025.  Bending the curve still requires even more deliberate, thoughtful efforts to address climate change \u2014 policies to limit emissions, deploying clean energy, doing more with less, and innovation. Conversely, global emissions could just as easily shoot back up if governments and companies give up on their goals.  \u201cPeaking is absolutely not a guarantee,\u201d Grant said. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, even at a slower rate, Earth will continue heating up. It means more polar ice will melt, lifting sea levels along every ocean, increasing storm surges and floods during cyclones. It means more dangerous heat waves. It means more parts of the world will be unlivable.  There are some other caveats to consider. One is that it\u2019s tricky to simply get a full tally of humanity\u2019s total impact on the climate. Scientists can measure carbon dioxide concentrations in the sky, but it\u2019s tougher to trace where those molecules came from.  Burning fossil fuels is the dominant way humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Since they\u2019re closely tracked commercial commodities, there are robust estimates for their contributions to climate change and how they change over time.  But humans are also degrading natural carbon-absorbing ecosystems like mangrove forests. Losing carbon sinks increases the net amount of carbon dioxide in the air. Altering how we use land, like clearing forests for farms, also shifts the balance of carbon. These changes can have further knock-on effects for the environment, and ecosystems like tropical rainforests could reach tipping points where they undergo irreversible, self-propagating shifts that limit how much carbon they can absorb.  All this makes it hard to nail down a specific time frame for when emissions will peak and what the consequences will be.  There\u2019s also the thorny business of figuring out who is accountable for which emissions. Fossil fuels are traded across borders, and it\u2019s not always clear whose ledger high-polluting sectors like international aviation and shipping should fall on. Depending on the methodology, these gray areas can lead to double-counting or under-counting.  \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get a complete picture, and even if we get the little bits and pieces, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Luca Lo Re, climate and energy analyst at the IEA.  Even with these uncertainties, it\u2019s clear that the scale of the course correction needed to meet climate goals is immense.  According to the Climate Analytics report, to meet the 2030 targets for cutting emissions, the world will need to stop deforestation, stop any new fossil fuel development, double energy efficiency, and triple renewable energy.  Another way to illustrate the enormity of this task is the Covid-19 pandemic. The world experienced a sudden drop in global emissions as travel shut down, businesses closed, people stayed home, and economies shrank. Carbon dioxide output has now rebounded to an even higher level. Reducing emissions on an even larger scale without increasing suffering \u2014 in fact, improving welfare for more people \u2014 will require not just clean technology but careful policy. Seeing emissions level off or decline in many parts of the world as economies have grown in recent decades outside of the pandemic is an important validation that the efforts to limit climate change are having their intended effect. \u201cEmissions need to decrease for the right reasons,\u201d Lo Re said. \u201cIt is reasonable to believe our efforts are working.\u201d The mounting challenge is that energy demand is poised to grow. Even though many countries have decoupled their emissions from their GDPs, those emissions are still growing. Many governments are also contending with higher interest rates, making it harder to finance new clean energy development just as the world needs a massive buildout of solar panels, wind turbines, and transmission lines.  And peaking emissions isn\u2019t enough: They have to fall. Fast.  The longer it takes to reach the apex, the steeper the drop-off needed on the other side in order to meet climate goals. Right now, the world is poised to walk down a gentle sloping hill of greenhouse gas emissions instead of the plummeting roller coaster required to limit warming this century to less than 2.7\u00b0F/1.5\u00b0C. It\u2019s increasingly unlikely that this goal is achievable.  Finally, the ultimate validation of peak greenhouse emissions and a sustained decline can only be determined with hindsight. \u201cWe can\u2019t know if we peaked in 2023 until we get to 2030,\u201d said Lazarus. The world may be closer than ever to bending the curve on greenhouse gas emissions downward, but those final few degrees of inflection may be the hardest.  The next few years will shape the warming trajectory for much of the rest of the century, but obstacles ranging from political turmoil to international conflict to higher interest rates could slow progress against climate change just as decarbonization needs to accelerate.  \u201cWe should be humble,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThe future is yet unwritten and is in our hands.\u201d Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

Technologies like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies are raising overall energy demand as well.\n\nStill, that it\u2019s possible at all to conceive of bending the curve in the near term after more than a century of relentless growth shows that there\u2019s a radical change underway in the relationship between energy, prosperity, and pollution \u2014 that standards of living can go up even as emissions from coal, oil, and gas go down.\n\nGreenhouse gases are not a runaway rocket, but a massive, slow-turning cargo ship. It took decades of technology development, years of global bickering, and billions of dollars to wrench its rudder in the right direction, and it\u2019s unlikely to change course fast enough to meet the most ambitious climate change targets.\n\nBut once underway, it will be hard to stop.\n\nSince the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions have risen in tandem with wealth and an expanding population. Since the 1990s and the 2000s, that direct link has been separated in at least 30 countries, including the US, Singapore, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Their economies have grown while their impact on the climate has shrunk per person.\n\nIn the past decade, the rate of global carbon dioxide pollution has held fairly level or risen slowly even as the global economy and population has grown by wider margins. Worldwide per capita emissions have also held steady over the past decade.\n\n\u201cWe can be fairly confident that we\u2019ve flattened the curve,\u201d said Michael Lazarus, a senior scientist at SEI US, an environmental think tank, who was not involved in the Climate Analytics study.\n\nStill, this means that humanity is adding to the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere \u2014 and doing so at close to its fastest pace ever.\n\nIt\u2019s good that this pace is at least not accelerating, but the plateau implies a world that will continue to get warmer. To halt rising temperatures, humans will have to stop emitting greenhouse gases, zeroing their net output, and even start withdrawing the carbon previously emitted.\n\nThe world thus needs another drastic downward turn in its emissions trajectory to limit climate change.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t get out any balloons or fireworks over flattening emissions,\u201d Lazarus said.\n\nThen there\u2019s the clock. In order to meet the Paris climate agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) on average above pre-industrial temperatures, the world must slash carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nThat means power generators, trucks, aircraft, farms, construction sites, home appliances, and manufacturing plants all over the world will have to rapidly clean up.\n\nThe current round of international climate commitments puts the planet on track to warm by 5.4\u00b0F (3\u00b0C) by the end of the century. That\u2019s a world in which the likelihood of a major heat wave in a given year would more than double compared to 2.7\u00b0F of warming, where extreme rainfall events would almost double, and more than one in 10 people would face threats from sea level rise.\n\nGrant and his team mapped out three scenarios. The first is a baseline based on forecasts from the International Energy Agency on how current climate policies and commitments would play out. It shows that fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide emissions would reach a peak this year, but emissions of other heat-trapping gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons would keep rising, so overall greenhouse gas emissions would level off.\n\nThe second scenario, dubbed \u201clow effort,\u201d builds on the first, but also assumes that countries will begin to fulfill their promises under agreements like the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane pollution 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 and the Kigali Amendment to phase out HFCs. Under this pathway, total global emissions reach their apex in 2025.\n\nThe third scenario imagines a world where clean technology \u2014 renewable energy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency \u2014 continues gaining ground at current rates, outstripping energy demand growth and displacing coal, oil, and natural gas. That would mean greenhouse gases would have already peaked in 2023 and are now on a long, sustained decline.\n\nThe stories look different when you zoom in to individual countries, however. While overall emissions are poised to decline, some developing countries will continue to see their output grow while wealthier countries make bigger cuts.\n\nAs noted, the US has already climbed down from its peak. China expects to see its emissions curve change directions by 2025. India, the world\u2019s third largest greenhouse gas emitter, may see its emissions grow until 2045.\n\nAll three of these pathways anticipate some sort of peak in global emissions before the end of the decade, illustrating that the world has many of the tools it needs to address climate change and that a lot of work in deploying clean energy and cleaning up the biggest polluters is already in progress.\n\nThere will still be year-to-year variations from phenomena like El Ni\u00f1o that can raise electricity demand during heat waves or shocks like pandemics that reduce travel or conflicts that force countries to change their energy priorities.\n\nBut according to the report, the overall trend over decades is still downward.\n\nTo be clear, the Carbon Analytics study is one of the more optimistic projections out there, but it\u2019s not that far off from what other groups have found.\n\nIn its own analysis, the International Energy Agency reports that global carbon dioxide emissions \u201care set to peak this decade.\u201d The consulting firm McKinsey anticipates that greenhouse gases will begin to decline before 2030, also finding that 2023 may have been the apogee.\n\nGlobal emissions could just as easily shoot back up if governments and companies give up on their goals\n\nWithin the energy sector, Ember, a think tank, found that emissions might have peaked in 2022. Research firm Rystad Energy expects that fossil fuel emissions will reach their pinnacle in 2025.\n\nBending the curve still requires even more deliberate, thoughtful efforts to address climate change \u2014 policies to limit emissions, deploying clean energy, doing more with less, and innovation.\n\nConversely, global emissions could just as easily shoot back up if governments and companies give up on their goals.\n\n\u201cPeaking is absolutely not a guarantee,\u201d Grant said.\n\nAnd if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, even at a slower rate, Earth will continue heating up. It means more polar ice will melt, lifting sea levels along every ocean, increasing storm surges and floods during cyclones. It means more dangerous heat waves. It means more parts of the world will be unlivable.\n\nThere are some other caveats to consider. One is that it\u2019s tricky to simply get a full tally of humanity\u2019s total impact on the climate. Scientists can measure carbon dioxide concentrations in the sky, but it\u2019s tougher to trace where those molecules came from.\n\nBurning fossil fuels is the dominant way humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Since they\u2019re closely tracked commercial commodities, there are robust estimates for their contributions to climate change and how they change over time.\n\nBut humans are also degrading natural carbon-absorbing ecosystems like mangrove forests. Losing carbon sinks increases the net amount of carbon dioxide in the air. Altering how we use land, like clearing forests for farms, also shifts the balance of carbon.\n\nThese changes can have further knock-on effects for the environment, and ecosystems like tropical rainforests could reach tipping points where they undergo irreversible, self-propagating shifts that limit how much carbon they can absorb.\n\nAll this makes it hard to nail down a specific time frame for when emissions will peak and what the consequences will be.\n\nThere\u2019s also the thorny business of figuring out who is accountable for which emissions. Fossil fuels are traded across borders, and it\u2019s not always clear whose ledger high-polluting sectors like international aviation and shipping should fall on. Depending on the methodology, these gray areas can lead to double-counting or under-counting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to get a complete picture, and even if we get the little bits and pieces, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d said Luca Lo Re, climate and energy analyst at the IEA.\n\nEven with these uncertainties, it\u2019s clear that the scale of the course correction needed to meet climate goals is immense.\n\nAccording to the Climate Analytics report, to meet the 2030 targets for cutting emissions, the world will need to stop deforestation, stop any new fossil fuel development, double energy efficiency, and triple renewable energy.\n\nAnother way to illustrate the enormity of this task is the Covid-19 pandemic. The world experienced a sudden drop in global emissions as travel shut down, businesses closed, people stayed home, and economies shrank. Carbon dioxide output has now rebounded to an even higher level.\n\nReducing emissions on an even larger scale without increasing suffering \u2014 in fact, improving welfare for more people \u2014 will require not just clean technology but careful policy.\n\nSeeing emissions level off or decline in many parts of the world as economies have grown in recent decades outside of the pandemic is an important validation that the efforts to limit climate change are having their intended effect.\n\n\u201cEmissions need to decrease for the right reasons,\u201d Lo Re said. \u201cIt is reasonable to believe our efforts are working.\u201d\n\nThe mounting challenge is that energy demand is poised to grow. Even though many countries have decoupled their emissions from their GDPs, those emissions are still growing. Many governments are also contending with higher interest rates, making it harder to finance new clean energy development just as the world needs a massive buildout of solar panels, wind turbines, and transmission lines.\n\nAnd peaking emissions isn\u2019t enough: They have to fall. Fast.\n\nThe longer it takes to reach the apex, the steeper the drop-off needed on the other side in order to meet climate goals. Right now, the world is poised to walk down a gentle sloping hill of greenhouse gas emissions instead of the plummeting roller coaster required to limit warming this century to less than 2.7\u00b0F/1.5\u00b0C.\n\nIt\u2019s increasingly unlikely that this goal is achievable.\n\nFinally, the ultimate validation of peak greenhouse emissions and a sustained decline can only be determined with hindsight. \u201cWe can\u2019t know if we peaked in 2023 until we get to 2030,\u201d said Lazarus.\n\nThe world may be closer than ever to bending the curve on greenhouse gas emissions downward, but those final few degrees of inflection may be the hardest.\n\nThe next few years will shape the warming trajectory for much of the rest of the century, but obstacles ranging from political turmoil to international conflict to higher interest rates could slow progress against climate change just as decarbonization needs to accelerate.\n\n\u201cWe should be humble,\u201d Grant said. \u201cThe future is yet unwritten and is in our hands.\u201d",

Mostly available in the western United States, geothermal power is still a tiny proportion of US energy but already produces enough electricity to power 2.7 million homes. For comparison, geyser-filled Iceland gets 66% of its primary energy from geothermal power. Like many ecologically friendly initiatives, \"green\" energy has gotten its name because it is good for the planet.\u00a0 It has\u00a0become common to label clean, renewable projects \"green\" to remind people that they are intended help lead to a healthier, greener, more sustainable planet. Green racing, Green New Deal\u00a0and green plane fares\u00a0are other examples. While scientists agree green energy helps fight climate change, it's important to remember that not everything with the \"green\" label is actually better. It can also be used as\u00a0a form of \"greenwashing\" where a company tries to make a product or policy seem environmentally friendly when it in fact isn't. The shift to renewable energy is important because most of these power sources don't produce greenhouse gasses that drive climate change. These gases, especially the carbon dioxide produces when coal, oil or natural gas are burned, create\u00a0a \"blanket\" in the atmosphere that holds in heat. Since humans began burning large amounts of coal at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, later adding oil and natural gas, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased from 280 parts per million to 418 parts per million.\u00a0 DEFINITIONS: Is climate change the same thing as global warming? Definitions explained. CLIMATE CHANGE CAUSES: Why scientists say humans are to blame. In general, renewable and green energy mean the same thing.\u00a0 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines green power as a subset of renewable energy, including all renewable energy resources that provide the greatest environmental benefit and the lowest environmental cost. In practice, this means all renewable energy sources with the exception of large hydroelectric resources that can have \"environmental trade-offs on issues such as fisheries and land use.\" Here's a cheat sheet: Carbon-neutral energy is energy that is produced without emitting greenhouse gases\u00a0into the atmosphere. Renewable energy sources \u2013 wind, solar, hydroelectric, biomass and geothermal\u00a0\u2013 are all considered carbon-neutral energy production, although building them (and all energy plants) does produce carbon.

        "text": "Oil and gas is required for many of life's\u00a0everyday functions. Cars, trains and planes all rely on fuel in order to move people around, leaving many dependent on them. Many also rely on gas and fuel to keep their homes warm during the winter. Although there are renewable energy sources like solar panels and windmills as well as transportation alternatives like electric vehicles, the economy is still \"hooked\" on oil. There are, however, many concerns about the negative environmental impact\u00a0of the oil industry and its contribution to climate change. To better understand the impact\u00a0of oil and gas on the environment, and even the health of individuals, it's important to know where oil and gas come\u00a0from and what fracking is.\u00a0 Fracking is a method used to extract natural gas\u00a0and oil from deep within the Earth\u2019s surface, according to National Geographic. During the process of\u00a0fracking, chemicals, water and sand are injected at a high pressure to open and widen cracks below the surface of the Earth.\u00a0 There are many areas in the United States where fracking takes place including in the Marcellus shale formation in the northern Appalachian Basin. This includes areas in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia, according to National Geographic. Hydraulic fracturing is what is commonly referred to as fracking.\u00a0The Barnett shale formation in northern Texas was one of the first places to use hydraulic fracturing technology, according to National Geographic. According to Investopedia, crude oil is a fossil fuel made up of organic materials and hydrocarbon deposits. A\u00a0petroleum product, crude oil is often refined to create diesel and gasoline. Natural gas is a fossil fuel made up of many different compounds, with the largest compound\u00a0being\u00a0methane. Found deep under the Earth\u2019s surface, natural gas is used as a fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Many also rely on gas and fuel to keep their homes warm during the winter. Although there are renewable energy sources like solar panels and windmills as well as transportation alternatives like electric vehicles, the economy is still \"hooked\" on oil. There are, however, many concerns about the negative environmental impact of the oil industry and its contribution to climate change. To better understand the impact of oil and gas on the environment, and even the health of individuals, it's important to know where oil and gas come from and what fracking is.\n\nFracking is a method used to extract natural gas and oil from deep within the Earth\u2019s surface, according to National Geographic. During the process of fracking, chemicals, water and sand are injected at a high pressure to open and widen cracks below the surface of the Earth.\n\nThere are many areas in the United States where fracking takes place including in the Marcellus shale formation in the northern Appalachian Basin. This includes areas in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Ohio, Virginia and West Virginia, according to National Geographic. Hydraulic fracturing is what is commonly referred to as fracking. The Barnett shale formation in northern Texas was one of the first places to use hydraulic fracturing technology, according to National Geographic.\n\nAccording to Investopedia, crude oil is a fossil fuel made up of organic materials and hydrocarbon deposits. A petroleum product, crude oil is often refined to create diesel and gasoline. Natural gas is a fossil fuel made up of many different compounds, with the largest compound being methane. Found deep under the Earth\u2019s surface, natural gas is used as a fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\n\nThere are many negative effects associated with fracking, both health-wise and environmentally. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, because of the toxic air pollution resulting from fracking, health effects include childhood leukemia, cardiac problems, asthma symptoms, birth defects and headaches. Some of the over 1,000 harmful chemicals used in fracking have even been linked to cancer.\n\nThere are no federal requirements for drillers to disclose what chemicals they use, meaning that people often do not know what is being pumped into their communities. State laws are also poorly enforced and there is limited testing data on air and water quality, according to the NRDC.\n\nBecause of the many unknowns, nurses and doctors often have difficulty determining what chemicals a patient has been exposed to, the Natural Resources Defense Council says. Fracking has also been linked to a loss of plant and animal species due to greenhouse gasses, toxic air pollutants, water waste and noise, according to Yale University. Fracking is also sometimes linked problems in communities with fewer resources, worsening their burden.\n\nThe Independent Petroleum Association of America on its website contends fracking \"has improved public health by dramatically improving air quality in recent years. This is not to say there are no risks, but the full body of research on this issue shows that those risks are manageable.\" The IPAA also says some states have \"found that emissions during oil and natural gas development do not exceed public health thresholds.\" The association also says \"two dozen scientific studies have concluded that fracking does not pose a major threat to groundwater.\"",

        "text": "CRANDON, Wis. \u2212 In the 1970s, Forest County Potawatomi Community elders noticed something strange happening to the ecosystem in northeast Wisconsin. Plant leaves changed sizes, animals moved to new habitats, medicines the tribe gathered became less potent or disappeared altogether. Nothing in the tribe\u2019s oral history or traditional knowledge explained the abnormalities. \u201cThe earth is trying to tell us something,\u201d tribal elder Jim Thunder said in describing the situation at a climate change conference in the early 2000s. \u201cYou learn by watching what\u2019s going on around you.\u201d\u00a0 Heeding the elders\u2019 concerns, tribal researchers studied lakes on the reservation and discovered they were tainted with mercury. They traced the mercury to a nearby power plant that burned coal. The chemical element \u2013 which has much higher concentrations in coal than other fossil fuels \u2013 was emitted into the atmosphere during the combustion process, and fell onto the reservation via rain.\u00a0 Mercury can have irreversible, toxic health effects. The discovery was possible because elders listened to the land and spoke up. \u201cThe clean air efforts of the tribe go back to the tribal elders,\u201d said Jeff Crawford, the attorney general for the Forest County Potawatomi. \u201cThey are the protectors of our cultural beliefs.\u201d\u00a0 The Seven Generations belief system of the Potawatomi, and many of the more than 500 tribal nations in the U.S., is that stewardship of the environment is essential so that the ecosystem will still be healthy at least seven generations from now. That includes air quality, and many tribes in the Great Lakes region have developed innovative ways to protect that resource.\u00a0 But air doesn\u2019t abide by any sort of man-made boundary. Climate change \u2013 largely driven by global reliance on fossil fuels \u2013 is expected to worsen pollution, and that pollution won't just stop at reservation borders. Scientists say there must be \u201ca substantial reduction in overall fossil fuel use\u201d and until the world\u2019s largest fossil fuel emitters, like the U.S., curb those fuels, there\u2019s only so much progress that can be made. Greenhouse gases stay in the atmosphere for decades.\u00a0 After identifying the polluted air affecting their reservation, Forest County Potawatomi leaders took a big step. They applied for a special classification that would recognize the importance of clean air and help them protect it.\u00a0 The federal Clean Air Act sorts areas of the country into three classes. Each class permits different levels of air quality deterioration. Most of the country belongs in Class II. Large national parks and wilderness areas are designated as Class I \u2013 places where the air is pristine and must remain that way. States and tribal governments have the authority to apply for Class I status in certain areas, and obtaining that status means they get notified \u2013 and a chance to weigh in \u2013 when developers propose a project that would pollute air in the area.\u00a0 In 1993, the Forest County Potawatomi sent a letter to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency stating their intent to have their reservation lands redesignated as Class I. In the tribe\u2019s application, which was formally submitted in 1995, officials explained that in the tribe\u2019s cultural and spiritual practices, natural resources \u201cmust be drawn from spiritually pure natural environments. Concern about access to these resources and the ability of the environment to provide the pure resources needed to sustain Potawatomi culture occupies the thoughts and prayers of the community.\u201d Tribal officials also explained that clean air is important to the economy of the tribe and of northern Wisconsin, where recreation and tourism are primary to the economic base. In the application, Thunder lamented the pollution of the air and other natural resources.\u00a0 \u201cWe are abusing our Mother Earth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI pray to our Creator that we look back so that we may see ahead. \u2026 Let us respect our children and, above all, let us live our lives in accordance with our beliefs.\u201d\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t an easy road. Legal battles stretched on for more than a decade as industry lobbyists and developers fought against the redesignation. Crawford recalled the state of Michigan opposing the designation vigorously.\u00a0 But in 2008, the tribal lands gained the Class I designation. Today, the tribe is one of just six across the U.S. to accomplish that. When a development with the potential to pollute air as far as 186 miles from the Potawatomi Reservation applies for a permit, tribal officials have the chance to weigh in. \"That's a pretty exclusive classification, and a ... stringent and rigorous process to go through,\" said Ben Giwojna, the tribal air coordinator for the EPA\u2019s upper Midwest region. \u201cIt\u2019s quite an endeavor, I\u2019ll say that.\" It isn\u2019t the only way tribes can exert influence when it comes to air quality. Eight of the 35 tribes in the region hold \u201ctreatment as a state\u201d status, Giwojna explained, meaning they get to operate their own air monitoring programs.\u00a0 \u201cAnytime we can acknowledge and recognize tribal sovereignty, it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. Under that status, the tribes also can achieve different benefits, like a chance to review air pollution permits. Those reviews can provide an important opportunity for tribes to share Indigenous knowledge of the flora and fauna in the area and how it might be affected by air pollution, Giwojna said.\u00a0 \u201cThey have their own perspective on things that we don\u2019t have working from the regional office in Chicago. They\u2019re on the ground and know the lay of the land,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have that background that they can impart \u2026 that maybe we don\u2019t have at the moment in EPA circles.\u201d Tribal communities have been able to weigh in on other air quality issues as well. Keshena, northwest of Green Bay, is home to what scientists around the world call one of the healthiest primeval forests in North America.\u00a0 The more than 200,000-acre Menominee Forest, managed by the Menominee Nation, removes pollutants from the air and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by storing carbon. A 2018 study found that tribal forests such as the Menominee were able to store more carbon than other forested lands in the area, particularly because the trees have been growing for centuries.\u00a0 \u201cCommunities downwind of the Menominee Forest benefit because they have less pollution, less carbon and better air quality,\u201d said Michael Skenadore, president of Menominee Tribal Enterprises, which runs the tribe\u2019s sustainable forestry operations. Nikki Cooley, co-director of the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals based at Northern Arizona University, called the forest an \u201camazing example\u201d of traditional knowledge preserving a longstanding natural resource.\u00a0 \u201c(Menominee tribal members) often talk about trees as \u2026 a community where they support each other in their growth,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are working together to survive, but also to help others thrive \u2013 and when I say others, I mean humans as well.\u201d\u00a0 Cooley said she\u2019s happy that traditional knowledge is gaining appreciation, but wary that credit for that knowledge won\u2019t be correctly assigned. If profit is produced, she said, it needs to go back to the tribes.\u00a0 That\u2019s where organizations like the National Indian Carbon Coalition come in.\u00a0 Bryan Van Stippen, a member of the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin, is the program director of the coalition, which helps tribal nations and individual Indigenous landowners develop carbon sequestration or offset projects to be able to take advantage of carbon credits.\u00a0 He believes tribes should be able to protect clean air and other natural resources \u2013 and benefit from their longstanding care for them \u2013 as new industries aimed at mitigating climate change spring up around them. Carbon capture reduces carbon dioxide emissions by capturing the gas from where it is produced before it\u2019s released into the atmosphere. Carbon credit projects allow a person or group that will store carbon \u2013 like in a tribally managed forest \u2013 to financially benefit by selling \u201ccredits\u201d for the storage to a company that wants to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions. Critics of carbon credits argue that such buying and selling doesn\u2019t actually reduce the amount of the gas released by the buying company and only allows it to claim eco-friendly status. Still, the market is hot, and Van Stippen wants to make sure that if credit is given out for environmental stewardship, the tribes get a fair share. For a long time, Van Stippen said, tribes had to make money by cutting trees down. Now, these projects are \u201ca tool in the tool chest to help tribes protect and preserve that tribal natural resource,\u201d he said. \u201cSo now we have another mechanism to derive this revenue.\u201d\u00a0 Climate change adds a layer of concern, especially in urban areas. Temperature and precipitation changes are expected to increase chances for unhealthy summertime ozone levels. Hotter summers are making stagnant air days more frequent, according to an analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit organization that reports on climate science. On those days, pollutants like ozone get trapped and make breathing more difficult.\u00a0 The situation is particularly challenging in Wisconsin, which has the third-largest racial disparity in the country when it comes to air pollution, according to a recent University of Illinois study. The disparity is most pronounced in Milwaukee, which has the highest concentration of Indigenous residents in the state. In a 2022 report on the status of tribal air quality, the National Tribal Air Association wrote that as outdoor air pollution forces people to spend more time indoors, indoor air quality is becoming a greater concern for tribes.\u00a0 Almost all tribes surveyed said mold was a concern in indoor housing, according to the report, followed by asthma and allergy triggers. Outdated appliances and worn-out air ducts leave elders and people with respiratory issues particularly vulnerable. Crawford, with the Forest County Potawatomi, called mitigating climate change a \u201cconstant battle\u201d and said the tribe is trying to do its part by producing more of its own renewable energy, particularly through solar panels. Since solar energy does not produce air pollution or greenhouse gas, it can have an indirect, but positive effect on the environment when it replaces other energy sources that produce more pollution. In rural, northern Wisconsin, the tribal communities can be identified easily by the relatively large number of solar panels on buildings.\u00a0 The Forest County Potawatomi also installed solar panels on its buildings in Milwaukee, including the casino hotel in the Menomonee River valley. Since 2010, tribal officials estimate, their solar panel installations and energy efficiency projects have prevented the emissions of 75,419 metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. They hope non-Indigenous communities follow suit.\u00a0 \u201cEveryone, governments and individuals collectively, has to do their part to start healing the world,\u201d Crawford said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to lead by example.\u201d This four-part series examines how Indigenous communities in Wisconsin are pushing to protect land, air and water. It is supported by a climate change reporting grant from the Poynter Institute, through funding by the Joyce Foundation.

        "summary_skeptic_gpt": "In Wisconsin, tribal elders noticed pollution harming their land. They found mercury from a coal plant was poisoning lakes and air. The tribe worked hard for clean air protections and now uses solar panels to cut carbon emissions. Their actions have already kept over 75,000 tons of pollution out of the air. They urge everyone to help protect our environment.",
        "lede_neutral_llama": "In the 1970s, the Forest County Potawatomi Community in northeast Wisconsin noticed a disturbing trend: changes in plant leaves, shifting animal habitats, and the decline of traditional medicines. Decades later, their vigilance led to a groundbreaking achievement: becoming one of just six tribes in the US to earn a Class I air quality designation, giving them a powerful voice in protecting their land and air from pollution. As the climate crisis worsens, their efforts serve as a model for Indigenous-led environmental stewardship and a call to action for communities nationwide.",
        "lede_skeptic_llama": "In the heart of Wisconsin, a Native American tribe's decades-long crusade for cleaner air is yielding results, but also underscores a harsh reality: even the most pristine wilderness areas are vulnerable to pollution from far-off fossil fuel power plants, and only a drastic reduction in global fossil fuel use can prevent the toxic consequences that have already harmed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.\" This lede highlights the tangible, local impacts of fossil fuel pollution and frames the tribe's efforts as a necessary response to a pressing environmental problem, rather than a radical environmentalist agenda.",
        "lede_neutral_gpt": "In the face of unfolding environmental mysteries in the 1970s, the Forest County Potawatomi Community elders in northeast Wisconsin discerned something was amiss\u2014plants were altering, animals shifting habitats, and essential medicines were dwindling. By heeding their insights and investigating further, the tribe discovered the culprit was mercury pollution from a nearby coal-burning power plant, marking the start of their determined quest for clean air. Now, decades later, their relentless efforts and cultural commitment to environmental stewardship have earned them a coveted Class I air quality designation, empowering the tribe to protect both their heritage and the air they share with surrounding communities.",
        "lede_skeptic_gpt": "In a bold move that highlights both the power and the cost of government intervention, the Forest County Potawatomi Community in Wisconsin secured a rare Class I air quality designation after a contentious 15-year battle against industry lobbyists. This unprecedented step allows the tribe to scrutinize and influence potential pollutants entering their airspace, underscoring their commitment to protecting their ecosystem in stark contrast to a global reliance on fossil fuels. While those skeptical of renewables may question the feasibility and economic impact of such measures, the tribe's actions spotlight a localized, proactive approach to environmental stewardship that challenges conventional energy priorities."

        "text": "The United States and the world are in a race against time to shift from greenhouse gas producing energy sources to carbon-free ones, which at this point means either nuclear plants, hydroelectric power, or solar and wind farms.\u00a0 Wind turbines and solar panels \u2013 which must be the main way forward \u2013 have been subject to\u00a0mis- and disinformation campaigns.\u00a0Alan Anderson heads the energy practice with the law firm of Polsinelli and says when he hears arguments against wind and solar, he thinks of bears and Bigfoot. \u201cBears are real \u2013 if you have a bear in your campsite, that\u2019s not good,\u201d the Kansas City, Missouri-based attorney said. \u201cBut if someone says there\u2019s a Bigfoot in their campsite, it\u2019s not real. \u201cWe're burdened by having to give factual information that's backed by science and engineering, whereas the other side's not. So we're at a disadvantage,\u201d he said.\u00a0 That contrast was on display recently at a commissioners meeting in Madison County, outside Columbus, Ohio. The proposed Oak Run solar farm would produce 800 megawatts of clean electricity, bringing an estimated $250 million in tax revenue over the project\u2019s 35-year life and providing dozens of long-term jobs. It would also cover at least 4,000 acres with solar panels and require four to eight years to construct.\u00a0 A crowd of neighbors was there to make sure that didn\u2019t happen. The panels would \u201ctake up prime farmland\u201d and kill birds, they said. \u201cThese are eyesores,\u201d said Heather Crum, of Somerford township. She and her husband moved to the area almost 20 years ago. \u201cHad we known, we would have done a 360.\u201d Locals are waiting for the Ohio Power Siting Board to decide whether the solar farm can be built. However, they\u2019ve already taken steps to make sure no other such projects can ever come to their county. On Sept. 12, the county commission voted to prohibit all new wind and solar farms. Across America, scenes like this one play out when large green energy projects are proposed. Some of the common objections are a matter of opinion \u2013 are wind turbines ugly or beautiful? Does a field of solar panels ruin a rural setting, or help preserve it? But other arguments are based on false information. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the most common ones. The short answer: Yes, wind turbines can kill both bats and birds. But the more important question is how many they kill compared with other sources. Buildings are estimated to kill up to 988 million birds a year and outdoor cats are an enormous danger to birds. By one estimate, free-ranging domestic cats kill between 1.3 billion and 4 billion birds each year. A study to be published in 2024 found that wind farms had no statistically significant effect on bird counts. But another kind of energy did. Fracking reduced the total number of birds counted in near shale and oil production sites by 15%. And all of that is separate from considering the impact of climate change.\u00a0\u00a0 The National Audubon Society has estimated that as many as two-thirds of North American bird species \u2013 398 species \u2013 are at risk of extinction due to changes in habitat caused by global warming.\u00a0 The answer: Some water birds can mistake a large solar farm for a body of water and attempt to land on it, which can harm the birds. However, according to the National Audubon Society, some developers are adding special patterns to panels or using other strategies to minimize the risk of crash landings. Audubon also notes that many states require solar developers to grow native plants in and among solar farms, benefiting birds and other pollinators. The answer: Agricultural communities have always exported what they produce, whether it\u2019s crops or livestock. \u201cThe beef and potatoes that ranchers and dairymen produce in Idaho don\u2019t all stay in Idaho,\u201d said John Robison, public lands director for the Idaho Conservation League. People in those communities see wheat and corn and soy being grown, see combines and grain bins, and know there\u2019s money for farmers and taxes for their communities. Solar advocates and energy developers say their task is to persuade people living near turbines or solar farms to look at them and realize it means jobs and better-funded schools and repaired roads. The answer: Improved standards for solar panels and wind turbines mean both have much longer lifespans today than they did a decade ago. Panels typically last 30 to 35 years while turbines have a lifespan of about 30 years.\u00a0 At that point, it\u2019s true: They must be decommissioned and disposed of. But the trash this will eventually produce pales in comparison to that produced by households, coal ash and plastic waste. Globally, municipal waste is expected to reach 70 billion metric tons by 2050, coal ash (the byproduct of burning coal) more than 45 billion metric tons and plastic waste 12 billion metric tons, a study published in the journal Nature Physics in October 2023 found. In comparison, even in the worst-case scenario, waste from solar panels is expected to reach 160 million metric tons globally by 2050. Most solar zoning codes require that the companies post bonds for decommissioning them at the end of their lifespans so that counties don\u2019t have to deal with disposal. The answer: There are a couple different issues here, including questions of what\u2019s really in the panels and also whether any of that stuff is actually risky. Here\u2019s the breakdown. Solar panels are mostly made of glass, aluminum and silicon \u2013 77%, 10% and 3%, respectively. It\u2019s true that trace elements are added to make them better conductors of electricity, usually cadmium and copper. What\u2019s less true is the idea of some other poisonous substances. Despite the fact that some states have gone so far as to ban use of these materials, there\u2019s no evidence that today\u2019s photovoltaic cells contain arsenic, germanium, hexavalent chromium or perfluoroalkyl substances. All of these items could, indeed, be poisonous, but they simply aren\u2019t there.\u00a0 The other question is whether it\u2019s possible for any of those materials to exit the solar panel and poison something else.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Research published in the Journal of Hazardous Materials in 2017 found that it\u2019s possible to release the trace amounts of cadmium in a solar panel \u2013 but to do so, you\u2019d first have to crush up the panel and then put the resulting powder in an acidic environment over several weeks. The bottom line: There\u2019s just not evidence of toxic material leaching out of solar panels in the rain. That hasn\u2019t stopped this argument from taking root. In Horry County, South Carolina, in 2020, in response to a proposed 138 megawatt solar project, community members raised concerns about the leaching of cadmium telluride, questioning what would happen if the solar panels were damaged in a hurricane. County council members also raised concerns about decommissioning and whether landfills would accept solar panels. Although the developer agreed not to use solar panels that include cadmium telluride, the project was never built. The answer: A study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory published in December found that, on average, homes located within one mile of a commercial wind turbine experience about an 11% decline in value following the announcement of a new commercial wind energy project. Homes between a mile and two miles were slightly affected, and any house more than two miles away wasn\u2019t affected at all. However, the effect was short-lived. Prices returned to pre-announcement levels within three to five years after the power project opened. The study looked at nearly 500,000 home sales across 34 states near 428 different wind projects between 2005 and 2009. To be clear, during that time, wind turbines were not as tall as state-of-the-art turbines today. However, because modern turbines are taller and produce more energy per turbine, fewer of them are required, so the area of potential shadow and noise is smaller. Research in the journal Energy Policy in 2022 showed that home values increased after wind projects began operating, though that is probably because taxes from the projects provided economic benefits to the area including better schools and infrastructure, making the community more enticing. The answer: Sound from wind turbines may be annoying, but it has no established adverse health effects, according to Peter Thorne, a professor and head of the University of Iowa's Department of Occupational and Environmental Health. Some opponents have said that turbines emit a low-frequency \u201cinfra-sound\u201d that causes headaches, nausea and other problems. But a report published in 2019 found no link between health outcomes and proximity to turbines. While researchers said the symptoms were often real, they were linked to beliefs and negative expectations, not the turbines. Farmland is a popular place to build solar because it\u2019s generally relatively flat and open. Not surprisingly, places where people grow crops tend to have good sunlight. So an increasingly common argument for curtailing solar projects is to preserve farmland. Some counties now set limits on the amount of agricultural land that can be turned into a solar farm.\u00a0 Opponents argue that too much farmland being turned into solar farms will affect the country\u2019s ability to feed itself.\u00a0 The answer: No, solar will not use up all the farmland we need.\u00a0 The National Renewable Energy Laboratory estimates that for the U.S. to move completely to carbon-neutral power, it will require about 10,000 square miles of land. The Department of Agriculture already pays farmers to take about 24.8 million acres of less productive and environmentally sensitive land out of production. That\u2019s 38,750 square miles \u2013 more than the entire amount of land that would be needed for green energy.\u00a0 And in 2023, about 40% of the U.S. corn crop was used to produce ethanol. By some measures, an acre of solar power can make 70 times as much energy as an acre\u2019s worth of corn turned into ethanol. One version of this argument asserts that by placing solar panels on old industrial properties that have limited uses \u2013 such as old surface coal mines, chemical plants or former military sites \u2013 no undisturbed land will need to be used for solar power. This is called turning \u201cbrownfields\u201d into \u201cbrightfields,\u201d and avoiding solar on \u201cgreenfields.\u201d There are two problems. One is that there can be a high added expense to building on potentially toxic ground. Such projects can and often are placed on old landfill properties, but these are still more expensive than farmland or scrubland.\u00a0 The answer: Either way, solar panels ultimately have to cover acreage because they all need to face the sky. There simply aren\u2019t enough brownfields to reach the full needs of the energy transition. There\u2019s no rebuttal to this one: Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some people behold a wind turbine or a solar installation and see clean energy that will help stop global warming and make the United States more energy independent. Others see them as a blight that destroys the landscape and turns it into an industrial eyesore. \u201cThey\u2019re ugly, they don\u2019t work and they can explode,\u201d was how Elizabeth Finke described them at a hearing on a proposed solar installation near her family farm in Madison County, Ohio. It\u2019s worth noting that solar farms, compared with wind turbines, sit relatively low to the ground. In some parts of the country, once those panels are screened off by a row of trees or vegetation, they\u2019re hardly visible from afar. Still, they draw ire.\u00a0 This story was produced with support from the\u00a0McGraw Center for Business Journalism\u00a0at the\u00a0Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.",

Wind turbines and solar panels \u2013 which must be the main way forward \u2013 have been subject to mis- and disinformation campaigns. Alan Anderson heads the energy practice with the law firm of Polsinelli and says when he hears arguments against wind and solar, he thinks of bears and Bigfoot. \u201cBears are real \u2013 if you have a bear in your campsite, that\u2019s not good,\u201d the Kansas City, Missouri-based attorney said. \u201cBut if someone says there\u2019s a Bigfoot in their campsite, it\u2019s not real. \u201cWe're burdened by having to give factual information that's backed by science and engineering, whereas the other side's not. So we're at a disadvantage,\u201d he said. \n\nThat contrast was on display recently at a commissioners meeting in Madison County, outside Columbus, Ohio. The proposed Oak Run solar farm would produce 800 megawatts of clean electricity, bringing an estimated $250 million in tax revenue over the project\u2019s 35-year life and providing dozens of long-term jobs. It would also cover at least 4,000 acres with solar panels and require four to eight years to construct. \n\nA crowd of neighbors was there to make sure that didn\u2019t happen. The panels would \u201ctake up prime farmland\u201d and kill birds, they said. \u201cThese are eyesores,\u201d said Heather Crum, of Somerford township. She and her husband moved to the area almost 20 years ago. \u201cHad we known, we would have done a 360.\u201d Locals are waiting for the Ohio Power Siting Board to decide whether the solar farm can be built.

One shows windmills spread across an agricultural landscape and is labeled \"These quit working at -27C.\" The second shows solar panels and is labeled \"These quit working at sunset.\" The third shows an apparent coal mining operation and is labeled \"Coal does not quit.\" The post was shared more than 200 times in a month. More from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page Solar and wind power do not produce energy all of the time, but neither do coal plants, according to energy system experts. Coal plants \"quit\" due to mechanical failures, weather events and for scheduled maintenance. Grid operators employ a variety of strategies to maintain constant power flow as weather-dependent renewables proliferate on the grid. When full and partial outages are accounted for, U.S. coal plants are offline about 12% of the time due to maintenance or unexpected failures, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported in January. There are multiple recent examples of coal plants failing during major weather events. For instance, while the catastrophic power outages in Texas during the winter of 2021 were primarily caused by failures in the state's natural gas infrastructure, other forms of generation \u2212 including coal plants \u2212 also went offline due to cold temperatures. More: Can we count on renewable energy? Four ways wind, solar and water can power the US Coal plants also represented about 23% of the power plant outages during Winter Storm Elliot in 2022, contributing to rolling blackouts in the Southeastern U.S. In May 2022, coal plants unexpectedly went offline in Texas near the beginning of a record-breaking heat wave, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \"As (the grid operator) began preparing for the early season heat wave, it was without almost 20% of its installed, supposedly dispatchable coal-fired generation,\" the institute reports. That May, coal shortages also resulted in blackouts in India during a heat wave, AP reports. A 2019 study that modeled temperature-related conditions on the PJM grid in the eastern U.S., predicted that both hot and cold weather events would increase the likelihood of unplanned coal plant outages. Unplanned outage rates would reach around 13% when temperatures drop to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius) and 14% when temperatures rise to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), the study concluded. The Facebook post also states that solar panels stop producing after dark and wind turbines go offline at -27 degrees Celsius (-17 degrees Fahrenheit). While researchers are exploring innovations that could allow solar panels to produce power after dark, the technology was not designed to produce electricity at night. And winterized wind turbines are only rated to around -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2212 close to the figure given in the post \u2212 according to Paul Denholm, a researcher at the Grid Planning and Analysis Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. But grid planners know that. \"That's absolutely built into the way that the power system is designed,\" Denholm said. \"We don't count on the wind blowing. The wind is used to offset the need for other \u2212 primarily fossil fuel \u2212 resources that are expensive. So the basic idea is you can save money by not buying as much natural gas to run your power plants and offsetting that generation with wind.\" Fact check: False claim that wind turbine generators only last 3 to 4 years As the amount of solar and wind power on the grid increases and fossil fuels decline, storage technologies will become increasingly necessary to keep power flowing as solar and wind switch on and offline, USA TODAY previously reported. \"You use the sun when it's available \u2212 either use it directly or you charge up batteries with solar,\" Denholm said. \"Or when the wind is blowing more than you can use it, you charge a battery or other storage devices.\" The stored power can then be used when renewables are offline or output is low. Resource diversity \u2212 incorporating different types of renewable power onto the grid \u2212 will also be used to stabilize power flow on a renewables-dominated grid, Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, previously told USA TODAY. He noted that using wind and solar in tandem can be particularly useful. \"Wind and solar, which are both ... intermittent resources, are\u00a0complementary in nature,\" Jacobson said. \"When the sun is not shining, the wind is often blowing ... and vice versa. Thus, combining wind and solar on the grid smooths out the overall electricity supply over time.\" Transmitting renewable energy from other places via transmission lines is another way to keep the lights on when local renewables aren't producing. Power can be moved from places where electricity is being generated to places where it isn't. \"It's not always windy in North Dakota,\" Denholm said. But \"if the wind stops blowing in North Dakota, maybe it's blowing in Iowa.

        "onlytext": "Solar and wind power do not produce energy all of the time, but neither do coal plants, according to energy system experts. Coal plants \"quit\" due to mechanical failures, weather events and for scheduled maintenance. Grid operators employ a variety of strategies to maintain constant power flow as weather-dependent renewables proliferate on the grid. When full and partial outages are accounted for, U.S. coal plants are offline about 12% of the time due to maintenance or unexpected failures, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory reported in January. \n\nThere are multiple recent examples of coal plants failing during major weather events. For instance, while the catastrophic power outages in Texas during the winter of 2021 were primarily caused by failures in the state's natural gas infrastructure, other forms of generation \u2212 including coal plants \u2212 also went offline due to cold temperatures.\n\nCoal plants also represented about 23% of the power plant outages during Winter Storm Elliot in 2022, contributing to rolling blackouts in the Southeastern U.S. In May 2022, coal plants unexpectedly went offline in Texas near the beginning of a record-breaking heat wave, according to the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. \"As (the grid operator) began preparing for the early season heat wave, it was without almost 20% of its installed, supposedly dispatchable coal-fired generation,\" the institute reports. That May, coal shortages also resulted in blackouts in India during a heat wave, AP reports.\n\nA 2019 study that modeled temperature-related conditions on the PJM grid in the eastern U.S., predicted that both hot and cold weather events would increase the likelihood of unplanned coal plant outages. Unplanned outage rates would reach around 13% when temperatures drop to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius) and 14% when temperatures rise to 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius), the study concluded.\n\nThe Facebook post also states that solar panels stop producing after dark and wind turbines go offline at -27 degrees Celsius (-17 degrees Fahrenheit). While researchers are exploring innovations that could allow solar panels to produce power after dark, the technology was not designed to produce electricity at night. And winterized wind turbines are only rated to around -30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit) \u2212 close to the figure given in the post \u2212 according to Paul Denholm, a researcher at the Grid Planning and Analysis Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\n\nBut grid planners know that. \"That's absolutely built into the way that the power system is designed,\" Denholm said. \"We don't count on the wind blowing. The wind is used to offset the need for other \u2212 primarily fossil fuel \u2212 resources that are expensive. So the basic idea is you can save money by not buying as much natural gas to run your power plants and offsetting that generation with wind.\"\n\nAs the amount of solar and wind power on the grid increases and fossil fuels decline, storage technologies will become increasingly necessary to keep power flowing as solar and wind switch on and offline, USA TODAY previously reported. \"You use the sun when it's available \u2212 either use it directly or you charge up batteries with solar,\" Denholm said. \"Or when the wind is blowing more than you can use it, you charge a battery or other storage devices.\" The stored power can then be used when renewables are offline or output is low.\n\nResource diversity \u2212 incorporating different types of renewable power onto the grid \u2212 will also be used to stabilize power flow on a renewables-dominated grid, Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, previously told USA TODAY. He noted that using wind and solar in tandem can be particularly useful. \"Wind and solar, which are both ... intermittent resources, are complementary in nature,\" Jacobson said. \"When the sun is not shining, the wind is often blowing ... and vice versa. Thus, combining wind and solar on the grid smooths out the overall electricity supply over time.\"\n\nTransmitting renewable energy from other places via transmission lines is another way to keep the lights on when local renewables aren't producing. Power can be moved from places where electricity is being generated to places where it isn't. \"It's not always windy in North Dakota,\" Denholm said. But \"if the wind stops blowing in North Dakota, maybe it's blowing in Iowa. Maybe it's blowing in other locations.\"\n\nWhen reached by USA TODAY, the Facebook user, Climate Change is Crap, acknowledged that coal plants go offline from \"time to time for maintenance.\" The user didn't mention outages associated with weather or mechanical failures.",

Recent weather events, such as Winter Storm Elliot and Texas's 2021 winter freeze, have exposed vulnerabilities in coal-fired power, showing that outages can occur across all energy types when extreme weather strikes. As fossil fuels decline and renewables rise, new strategies and technologies are proving essential to maintain a steady power flow, challenging long-held assumptions about the dependability of conventional energy sources.",
        "lede_skeptic_gpt": "Despite common perceptions, coal plants, often viewed as the stalwarts of reliable energy, experience significant downtime due to mechanical failures and extreme weather, contributing to power outages during critical times. Recent events, including major winter storms and record-breaking heat waves, have highlighted the vulnerabilities of coal-fired power, which faces unplanned outages that rival the intermittency of renewables like wind and solar. As the energy landscape shifts, experts argue that acknowledging the shared unpredictability of both fossil fuels and renewables underscores the need for a diversified and resilient grid strategy."

That mix includes power from nuclear plants,\u00a0hydroelectric dams, solar and wind. With nuclear and hydropower relatively unchanged for years at about 19% and 10% respectively, the majority of the increase has come from the rapid build-out of solar and wind power, whose costs have plummeted in the past two decades.\u00a0 The statistics come from the annual\u00a0Sustainable Energy in America 2023 Factbook, released Wednesday. The Factbook is produced each year by BloombergNEF,\u00a0a division of Bloomberg LP focused on the transition to a lower-carbon economy, in partnership with the Business Council for Sustainable Energy.\u00a0 2022 also saw a huge increase in the number of electric vehicles Americans purchased, making up 7.1% of all new cars sold in the United States and bringing the total number of EVs in the country to just shy of 1 million. The slow but steady increase in renewable energy, which has also become cheaper than most other power sources, means the transition to a carbon-free energy system is now \"hard-wired\" into the U.S. economy, said Lisa Jacobson,\u00a0president of the Business Council for Sustainable Energy, which has funded the annual report since 2013. \"Despite high inflation and supply chain issues\u00a0and interconnection backlogs (in the electric grid), we still saw pretty amazing growth in the capacity of wind and especially solar, despite a challenging business environment,\" said\u00a0Harrison Fell, a professor of resource and energy economics at North Carolina State University.\u00a0 That shift, known as \"the energy transition,\" will be turbocharged in the coming years by the passage of 2021's Inflation Reduction Act, which included billions of dollars to help the United States shift to clean power and meet its goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon-neutral energy is energy that is produced without emitting greenhouse gases\u00a0into the atmosphere. It includes both renewable energy sources plus nuclear power, which while not renewable, also doesn't emit greenhouse gasses. A subset of carbon-neutral energy is renewable energy, which is electricity\u00a0produced by fuel sources that renew themselves and do not diminish when humans tap them for power.\u00a0These include\u00a0electricity from solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric dams and a small amount of what's known as biomass, which is burning wood, crop waste, or garbage. In 2022, 41% of U.S. electricity was produced by carbon-free sources. Energy from renewable sources produced 23% of U.S. electricity\u00a0in 2022. Sales of electric vehicles surged 50% in 2022, bringing the nation's fleet of battery-powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles to an estimated 982,000 cars.

In 2022, natural gas produced 39% of U.S. electricity, up from 38% in 2021. A decade ago, it stood at 31% but has since taken over much of the generation previously provided by coal. Electricity produced by\u00a0burning coal slid to 19% of the U.S. energy consumption in 2022. Just ten years ago, coal provided 37% of U.S. electricity. The shift has come as coal became more expensive in relation to natural gas and renewable energy sources. The cost of 1 megawatt-hour of electricity from coal was on average $100 in the second half of 2022, compared with $58 for a combined cycle natural gas plant, according to the Factbook.

And is the warming climate to blame for wild weather events?\u00a0Here\u2019s some key information:\u00a0 Weather is what you\u00a0see outside the window. Climate is what occurs in an area over years or decades.\u00a0Climate change is the difference\u00a0seen in long-term trends in air, water and ocean temperatures and longer-term weather patterns. Monitoring stations around the world add to a growing trove of information that reveals how temperature and rainfall\u00a0are changing.\u00a0Some have decades of measurements, while others have more than a century of data. In Japan, they've recorded the start of the cherry tree\u00a0bloom\u00a0for more than 1,200 years. Scientists use these historical records to study the rise in global average temperatures. For example, records show how sap rises earlier in maple trees or\u00a0when wildfire seasons\u00a0start\u00a0earlier. They know warmer temperatures delay ice formation on the Great Lakes, when the warmer water temperatures fuel\u00a0more lake effect snow. Spring flowers appear earlier. The biggest influence on the planet's changing climate is the release of emissions into the atmosphere from burning\u00a0oil, gas and coal to move people and goods from place to place and to create energy, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\u00a0 Here's how that works: If CO2 doubles above the pre-industrial levels benchmark, the draft of the latest National Climate Assessment said\u00a0global temperatures could rise by 4.5 \u2013 7.2 degrees, spawning deadly heat waves, crop damage and other cascading impacts around the world. So what can be done to prevent the dire consequences forecast if emissions and temperatures continue to rise?\u00a0 Scientists with the United Nations and governments around the world say fossil fuel emissions must be slashed and soon to avoid \"catastrophic consequences.\"\u00a0To keep the increase\u00a0in global average temperatures at 2.7 degrees\u00a0compared to temperatures in the late 1800s, the world must reach \"net zero\" CO2 emissions by 2050, according to the latest climate assessment. The world can't slash all emissions, so reaching the result of net zero emissions requires removing carbon dioxide from the air through both natural and mechanical means, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported. That includes measures such as preserving and protecting forests and wetlands that store carbon and developing technologies that can effectively suck carbon from the air. Other methods urged by the U.N.\u00a0and others include living a less carbon-intensive lifestyle and increasing the use of renewable energy resources. Even if the world does reach net zero emissions, the national climate assessment states\u00a0it will be impossible to prevent some of the warming\u00a0already in motion.\u00a0 Disasters:\u00a018 billion-dollar disasters killed nearly 500 people last year, NOAA says Dinah Voyles Pulver covers climate and environment issues for USA TODAY.

In Japan, they've recorded the start of the cherry tree bloom for more than 1,200 years.\n\nScientists use these historical records to study the rise in global average temperatures. For example, records show how sap rises earlier in maple trees or when wildfire seasons start earlier. They know warmer temperatures delay ice formation on the Great Lakes, when the warmer water temperatures fuel more lake effect snow. Spring flowers appear earlier.\n\nThe biggest influence on the planet's changing climate is the release of emissions into the atmosphere from burning oil, gas and coal to move people and goods from place to place and to create energy, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nHere's how that works: If CO2 doubles above the pre-industrial levels benchmark, the draft of the latest National Climate Assessment said global temperatures could rise by 4.5 \u2013 7.2 degrees, spawning deadly heat waves, crop damage and other cascading impacts around the world.\n\nSo what can be done to prevent the dire consequences forecast if emissions and temperatures continue to rise? \n\nScientists with the United Nations and governments around the world say fossil fuel emissions must be slashed and soon to avoid \"catastrophic consequences.\" To keep the increase in global average temperatures at 2.7 degrees compared to temperatures in the late 1800s, the world must reach \"net zero\" CO2 emissions by 2050, according to the latest climate assessment.\n\nThe world can't slash all emissions, so reaching the result of net zero emissions requires removing carbon dioxide from the air through both natural and mechanical means, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported. That includes measures such as preserving and protecting forests and wetlands that store carbon and developing technologies that can effectively suck carbon from the air.\n\nOther methods urged by the U.N. and others include living a less carbon-intensive lifestyle and increasing the use of renewable energy resources. Even if the world does reach net zero emissions, the national climate assessment states it will be impossible to prevent some of the warming already in motion.",

        "title": "Fossil fuels: Can humanity really kick its addiction?",
        "text": "We are about to pass a civilisational milestone, say forecasters. In the next few years we will pass 'peak' fossil fuels - it may have already happened. It will mean the world has reached its maximum use of coal, oil and gas and demand will begin to decline. It is an incredible achievement and something we should be celebrating far more enthusiastically, but it also raises crucial questions. Will the transition to a new clean energy system happen quickly, or will we fry the planet first? That's what the huge UN climate conference in Dubai is really about. And, we may be reaching the peak, but the fossil fuel mountain is much higher than most of us realise. The International Energy Agency (IEA), a respected world authority on the subject, predicts global fossil fuel use will peak in 2025, even if governments don't introduce any new climate policies. IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol called this an \"historic turning point\". What kind of a challenge do we face? The legendary academic and expert on the role of energy in human society Vaclav Smil, explained to me once that energy isn't just another input in the global economy, like steel, innovation or information technology - it IS the economy. \"The economy is basically converting one form of energy into another, that's all it is, right? Without having energy, there is no economy,\" he told me. He's deeply sceptical about how easily we'll wean ourselves off the fuels that are warming the planet. \"We are a fossil fuel society, I'm sorry about this,\" he said, emphasising that we're talking about a billion tonnes of steel a year, four billion tons of cement, and four billion tons of liquid fuels. These astronomical numbers are almost beyond our comprehension. That reflects just how central energy is to absolutely everything we do. Our species has been around for about 300,000 years. For 299,000 of those years virtually all of us lived short lives marked overwhelmingly by drudgery and poverty.  That all began to change about 1800 when we began to exploit the world's vast stores of fossilised sunlight.   The switch to coal, oil and gas sparked the industrial revolution and with it explosive economic growth. Horses gave way to the steam engine, then the internal combustion engine, then the jet engine.  And all the while the human population grew: from a couple of million of us at the end of the ice age, to a billion at the dawn of the industrial revolution and now more than eight billion human beings. But the unprecedented productivity of the industrial world means most of us enjoy prosperity and health even our grandparents would find astonishing. Our hunting and gathering ancestors got by on about 10 gigajoules of energy a year. The average American uses 50 times that now, Prof Smil estimates. In short, the energy mountain we have climbed is truly gargantuan. And we may be nearing the peak of our fossil fuel use, but 80% of the energy we use still comes from them. That is the challenge for the next energy revolution, the one the world is discussing at COP28 in Dubai - the switch to renewable energy. So, how's that coming along?   Wind and solar - the two great hopes for our clean energy future - have been growing rapidly. They accounted for around 12% of electricity generation in 2022, according to IEA figures, up from virtually nothing just a few decades ago. But most electricity - 70% of the total - is still generated from coal, oil and gas.  And electricity accounts for just one fifth of the world's total energy consumption. So wind and solar are actually only responsible for around 2% of global energy supply.   The reason we are reaching the peak of the fossil fuel mountain has less to do with renewables than it has with the growing efficiency of the world's power stations, steel works, cement kilns, fertiliser plants, glass factories, ships, planes and cars.  So, can we learn to do without them? Chris Stark, the head of the UK's climate watchdog, the Climate Change Committee, is more upbeat than Prof Smil. He pointed out to me here at COP28 that moving away from fossil fuels will involve electrifying virtually everything, and electric devices tend to be more efficient than those powered by fossil fuels. \"Think of the heat that comes off the bonnet of your car,\" he says.  \"It is wasted energy. You don't get that with an EV.\" Similarly, for every unit of energy you put into a gas boiler you get one unit of heat out. For an electric-powered heat pump you get three. Stark's point is that by switching to the electric solution you are reducing energy demand - making the mountain smaller.  \"Demand destruction\" he calls it. Renewable electricity is now often cheaper than fossil fuels so the switchover will save us all money over time, Mr Stark points out - and we all like to save money. We don't need big government subsidies to make it happen, he says, private cash should do the heavy lifting on this.  But with renewables the big costs are upfront, when you install the solar panels or wind turbines.   The savings come because the fuel - sun and wind - are free. Those upfront costs are an issue for poorer countries, which struggle to afford expensive projects.  But there is progress on that too, thanks in large part to the efforts of the prime minister of tiny Barbados, Mia Mottley. An investor raising money for a solar farm in Germany pays four or five per cent a year on a loan, in Zambia it is more like 20%, her team says.  Ms Mottley thinks she has ways to drive those interest rates down, and now has the backing of the new head of the World Bank, the Washington-based institution which helps developing countries advance their economies. If it can absorb some of the risk of putting money into renewables in developing countries, that could release hundreds of billions of dollars in loans from banks and other commercial organisations, Ms Mottley believes. So we are moving forward. The International Energy Agency is predicting the share of fossil fuels in global energy supply - stuck for decades at around 80% - will decline to 73% by 2030. \"The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it's unstoppable. It's not a question of \"if\", it's just a matter of \"how soon\" \u2014 and the sooner the better for all of us,\" says IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol. But remember how big the mountain is. We need to electrify everything possible for everyone on the planet and we need to do it pretty much all at once - the science tells us we've only got a few decades.  So, if you are wondering why we have reached the 28th of these COP conferences and we still haven't solved the climate problem, there's your answer. Update 16 February 2024: This article was amended to clarify the speed at which the world is expected to transition to clean energy.

And all the while the human population grew: from a couple of million of us at the end of the ice age, to a billion at the dawn of the industrial revolution and now more than eight billion human beings.\n\nBut the unprecedented productivity of the industrial world means most of us enjoy prosperity and health even our grandparents would find astonishing. Our hunting and gathering ancestors got by on about 10 gigajoules of energy a year. The average American uses 50 times that now, Prof Smil estimates. In short, the energy mountain we have climbed is truly gargantuan.\n\nAnd we may be nearing the peak of our fossil fuel use, but 80% of the energy we use still comes from them. That is the challenge for the next energy revolution, the one the world is discussing at COP28 in Dubai - the switch to renewable energy.\n\nSo, how's that coming along?   Wind and solar - the two great hopes for our clean energy future - have been growing rapidly. They accounted for around 12% of electricity generation in 2022, according to IEA figures, up from virtually nothing just a few decades ago. But most electricity - 70% of the total - is still generated from coal, oil and gas.  And electricity accounts for just one fifth of the world's total energy consumption. So wind and solar are actually only responsible for around 2% of global energy supply.\n\nThe reason we are reaching the peak of the fossil fuel mountain has less to do with renewables than it has with the growing efficiency of the world's power stations, steel works, cement kilns, fertiliser plants, glass factories, ships, planes and cars.\n\nSo, can we learn to do without them? Chris Stark, the head of the UK's climate watchdog, the Climate Change Committee, is more upbeat than Prof Smil. He pointed out to me here at COP28 that moving away from fossil fuels will involve electrifying virtually everything, and electric devices tend to be more efficient than those powered by fossil fuels. \"Think of the heat that comes off the bonnet of your car,\" he says.  \"It is wasted energy. You don't get that with an EV.\"\n\nSimilarly, for every unit of energy you put into a gas boiler you get one unit of heat out. For an electric-powered heat pump you get three. Stark's point is that by switching to the electric solution you are reducing energy demand - making the mountain smaller.  \"Demand destruction\" he calls it.\n\nRenewable electricity is now often cheaper than fossil fuels so the switchover will save us all money over time, Mr Stark points out - and we all like to save money. We don't need big government subsidies to make it happen, he says, private cash should do the heavy lifting on this.\n\nBut with renewables the big costs are upfront, when you install the solar panels or wind turbines.   The savings come because the fuel - sun and wind - are free. Those upfront costs are an issue for poorer countries, which struggle to afford expensive projects.\n\nBut there is progress on that too, thanks in large part to the efforts of the prime minister of tiny Barbados, Mia Mottley. An investor raising money for a solar farm in Germany pays four or five per cent a year on a loan, in Zambia it is more like 20%, her team says.\n\nMs Mottley thinks she has ways to drive those interest rates down, and now has the backing of the new head of the World Bank, the Washington-based institution which helps developing countries advance their economies. If it can absorb some of the risk of putting money into renewables in developing countries, that could release hundreds of billions of dollars in loans from banks and other commercial organisations, Ms Mottley believes.\n\nSo we are moving forward. The International Energy Agency is predicting the share of fossil fuels in global energy supply - stuck for decades at around 80% - will decline to 73% by 2030. \"The transition to clean energy is happening worldwide and it's unstoppable. It's not a question of \"if\", it's just a matter of \"how soon\" \u2014 and the sooner the better for all of us,\" says IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol.\n\nBut remember how big the mountain is. We need to electrify everything possible for everyone on the planet and we need to do it pretty much all at once - the science tells us we've only got a few decades.\n\nSo, if you are wondering why we have reached the 28th of these COP conferences and we still haven't solved the climate problem, there's your answer.",

        "title": "Challenge to stop solar panels becoming a 'waste mountain'",
        "text": "While they are being promoted around the world as a crucial weapon in reducing carbon emissions, solar panels degrade and become gradually less efficient. After about 25-30 years it's typically more cost effective to replace them with new ones. Experts say billions of panels will eventually all need to be disposed of and replaced.  \"The world has installed more than one terawatt of solar capacity. Ordinary solar panels have a capacity of about 400W, so if you count both rooftops and solar farms, there could be as many as 2.5 billion solar panels.,\" says Dr Rong Deng, an expert in solar panel recycling at the University of New South Wales in Australia. According to the British government, there are tens of millions of solar panels in the UK. But the specialist infrastructure to scrap and recycle them is lacking. Energy experts are calling for urgent government action to prevent a looming global environmental disaster. \"It's going to be a waste mountain by 2050, unless we get recycling chains going now,\" says Ute Collier, deputy director of the International Renewable Energy Agency.  \"We're producing more and more solar panels - which is great - but how are we going to deal with the waste?\" she asks. It is hoped a major step will be taken at the end of June, when the world's first factory dedicated to fully recycling solar panels officially opens in France.  ROSI, the specialist solar recycling company which owns the facility, in the Alpine city of Grenoble, hopes eventually to be able to extract and re-use 99% of a unit's components.  As well as recycling the glass fronts and aluminium frames, the new factory can recover nearly all of the precious materials contained within the panels, such as silver and copper, which are typically some of the hardest materials to extract.  These rare materials can subsequently be recycled and reused to make new, more powerful, solar units. Conventional methods of recycling solar panels recover most of the aluminium and glass - but ROSI says the glass, in particular, is of relatively low-quality.  The glass recovered using those methods can be used to create tiles, or in sandblasting - it can also be mixed with other materials to make asphalt - but it cannot be used in applications where high-grade glass is required, such as the production of new solar panels.   The new ROSI plant will open during a boom period for solar panel installations.  The world's solar energy generation capacity grew by 22% in 2021. Around 13,000 photovoltaic (PV) solar panels are fitted in the UK every month - most of them on the roofs of private houses.  In many cases, solar units become relatively uneconomical before they reach the end of their expected lifespan. New, more efficient designs evolve at regular intervals, meaning it can prove cheaper to replace solar panels that are only 10 or 15 years old with updated versions. If current growth trends are sustained, Ms Collier says, the volume of scrap solar panels could be huge. \"By 2030, we think we're going to have four million tonnes [of scrap] - which is still manageable - but by 2050, we could end up with more than 200 million tonnes globally.\" To put that into perspective, the world currently produces a total of 400 million tonnes of plastic every year.  The reason there are so few facilities for recycling solar panels is because there has not been much waste to process and reuse until recently.  The first generation of domestic solar panels is only now coming to the end of its usable life. With those units now approaching retirement, experts say urgent action is needed. \"Now is the time to think about this,\" says Ms Collier.  France is already a leader among European nations when it comes to processing photovoltaic waste, says Nicolas Defrenne. His organisation, Soren, partners with ROSI and other firms, co-ordinating the decommissioning of solar panels all over France. \"The biggest one [we decommissioned] took three months,\" Mr Defrenne recalls.  His team at Soren has been experimenting with different ways of recycling what they collect: \"We're throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks.\" At ROSI's high-tech plant in Grenoble, the solar panels are painstakingly taken apart to recover the precious materials inside - such as copper, silicon and silver. Each solar panel contains only tiny fragments of these precious materials and those fragments are so intertwined with other components that, until now, it has not been economically viable to separate them.  But because they are so valuable, extracting those precious materials efficiently could be a game-changer, says Mr Defrenne.  \"Over 60% of the value is contained in 3% of the weight of the solar panels,\" he says. The team at Soren are hopeful that, in the future, nearly three-quarters of the materials needed to make new solar panels - including silver - can be recovered from retired PV units and recycled - to help speed up production of new panels.  Currently there is not enough silver available to build the millions of solar panels which will be required in the the transition from fossil fuels, says Mr Defrenne: \"You can see where you have a production bottleneck, it's silver.\"  Meanwhile British scientists have been trying to develop similar technology to ROSI.  Last year, researchers at the University of Leicester announced they had worked out how to extract silver from PV units using a form of saline.  But so far, ROSI is the only company in its field to have scaled up its operation to industrial levels. Moreover, the technology is expensive. In Europe, importers or producers of solar panels most dispose of them responsibly. And many favour crushing or shredding the waste - which is far cheaper.  Mr Defrenne acknowledges that intensive recycling of solar panels is still in its infancy. Soren and its partners recycled just under 4,000 tonnes of French solar panels last year.  But there is potential to do a lot more. And he's making that his mission.  \"The weight of all the new solar panels sold last year in France was 232,000 tonnes - so, by the time those wear out in 20 years, that's how much I'll need to collect every year.   \"When that happens, my personal goal is to ensure France will be the technological leader of the world.\" Listen to The Climate Question on BBC Sounds Clarification 23 June 2023: An earlier version of this article stated solar panels had an average lifespan of 20-25 years. It has been updated to make clear this is the average length of their optimum efficiency.

        "title": "Solar panels used by British Army linked to claims of forced labour in China\n",
        "text": "The British Army is using solar panels made by companies claimed to have a \"very high\" exposure to forced labour in China, the BBC can reveal. The production of solar panels in the Xinjiang region has been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims. The British Army is investing \u00a3200m in solar panels across four of its sites. The Ministry of Defence listed JA Solar, Trina and Qcells as the solar panel suppliers in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request. A report in July this year by the UK's Sheffield Hallam University flags the three companies as having \"very high\" exposure to production in Xinjiang. JA Solar and Qcells told the BBC they were taking action to make sure forced labour had no part in their supply chains, but Trina didn't reply to requests for comment. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"We have robust procedures in place that allow us to vet and routinely monitor all aspects of our supply chain which is kept under constant review.\" But Alan Crawford, one of the authors of the Sheffield Hallam report, said he had seen the list of companies obtained by the BBC and he believed his findings still stood.  As a chemical engineer with extensive experience of supplier identification, he said big solar firms were unlikely to buy components they knew for certain were the products of forced labour. But, he added, there was a \"lack of transparency\" in the supply chain, which led some firms to \"hide behind\" their \"anti-slavery declarations\". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing calls to take a harder line against China and to end the UK's reliance on solar production from the country. Senior Conservative MP Alicia Kearns is urging the UK government to \"sanction and [impose] a ban on any solar company with links to Uyghur forced labour from operating in the UK\". The US has accused the Chinese government of arbitrarily detaining more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang prison camps. In state-sponsored programmes, detainees are forced to produce goods including polysilicon, a core ingredient in solar panels, according to the US Department of Labor. The Chinese government has always staunchly denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Ms Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, told the BBC there was \"an ever-growing mass of evidence linking the solar industry to the forced labour and genocide of the Uyghur people in China\". The MP said the UK Ministry of Defence's \"exposure via solar investments is indicative of the scale of the issue, which will only get worse as the UK continues to lag behind international partners in acting\". Solar power is huge source of renewable energy and one of the cornerstones of the international effort to curb climate-warming carbon emissions. China has dominated the market and, according to the International Energy Agency, the country's global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeds 80%. It's a dilemma for the UK, which imports a large portion of its solar panels from China. The British Army's use of Chinese-made solar panels comes as no surprise to Yalkun Uluyol. An academic native of Xinjiang, Mr Uluyol has been researching the links between Chinese manufacturers and alleged forced labour in his home region. Mr Uluyol said his research found forced labour \"happens almost everywhere in every sector\". The evidence for this, he added, can be found in official Chinese records and the personal experiences of Uyghurs like members of his family. He said relatives - including his father - had been held in detention camps, with some \"taken away to work in facilities\". \"Green energy means respect for human rights and respect for the environment,\" Mr Uluyol said. \"Both are absent from the Uyghur region.\" Mr Uluyol's conclusions are shared by the US government, which has passed a law that requires companies to prove that goods imported from Xinjiang were not produced with forced labour. The US has been blocking shipments of solar energy components since passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2021. Project Prometheus began in the same year, as allegations of forced labour in solar supply chains came into sharper focus. The fourth and final site - which is using solar panels made by JA Solar, a Chinese company - was due to open at Rock Barracks in Suffolk this year. Asked to comment on the Sheffield Hallam report, Michael Parr, a solar expert who works with Qcells, said there was \"no doubt that the broad assessment was pretty fair\". \"It's really challenging to do an airtight independent audit in China,\" said Mr Parr, the executive director of the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance. \"It's difficult to get clear data from the companies. Most of the wafer supply comes from numerous companies and they often blend. Even companies who are buying polysilicon from the US and Europe are reliant on China.\" When told the British Army was using solar panels made by JA Solar, Trina and Qcells, Mr Parr said: \"Europe has been less attentive to the risk of forced labour in solar than the US\". He said he would \"differentiate\" between the three companies supplying panels for Project Prometheus. He said while Trina and JA Solar were Chinese manufacturers \"with the vast majority of their manufacturing\" in China, Qcells was a South Korean company that's \"done a lot of work on trying to clean up their supply chains\". In recent years, solar companies have taken steps to sever ties with Xinjiang. Some have diversified their production to cut out the region, while the solar industry has tried to improve its monitoring of supply chains. A spokesperson for JA Solar said the company was \"strongly committed to ensuring that our operations and supply chain are free from any form of forced labour\". \"JA Solar has due diligence mechanisms in place, reviews its suppliers and has several ongoing projects to further enhance the traceability of all JA Solar modules,\" it added. A spokesperson for Segen, which supplied JA Solar panels to Project Prometheus, said the company was \"committed to achieving a traceable supply chain and has processes in place\".  The spokesperson said the UK solar sector was \"driving best practice\" through a scheme to encourage common standards of production and oversight. Qcells said it took \"the forced labour issue very seriously, which is why we do everything we can to track and monitor our supply chain\". A spokesperson said Qcells had adopted a code of conduct that \"prohibits forced-labour made products in our supply chain and we terminate agreements if suppliers fail to comply\". Qcells had invested \"billions of dollars\" in \"an entirely American supply chain to produce polysilicon-based solar panels\", the spokesperson added.  Trina did not respond to requests for comment. Plans for a solar farm bigger than 130 football pitches near Newent have been rejected. Councillors say renewable power is needed to tackle climate change. An Essex MP and ex-Tory Home Secretary says the Labour government has \"abandoned\" the region. Plans for a 154-acre site in Haswell Plough are knocked back by Durham County Council.

        "onlytext": "The British Army is using solar panels made by companies claimed to have a \"very high\" exposure to forced labour in China, the BBC can reveal. The production of solar panels in the Xinjiang region has been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims. The British Army is investing \u00a3200m in solar panels across four of its sites. The Ministry of Defence listed JA Solar, Trina and Qcells as the solar panel suppliers in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request. A report in July this year by the UK's Sheffield Hallam University flags the three companies as having \"very high\" exposure to production in Xinjiang. JA Solar and Qcells told the BBC they were taking action to make sure forced labour had no part in their supply chains, but Trina didn't reply to requests for comment. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"We have robust procedures in place that allow us to vet and routinely monitor all aspects of our supply chain which is kept under constant review.\" But Alan Crawford, one of the authors of the Sheffield Hallam report, said he had seen the list of companies obtained by the BBC and he believed his findings still stood.  As a chemical engineer with extensive experience of supplier identification, he said big solar firms were unlikely to buy components they knew for certain were the products of forced labour. But, he added, there was a \"lack of transparency\" in the supply chain, which led some firms to \"hide behind\" their \"anti-slavery declarations\". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing calls to take a harder line against China and to end the UK's reliance on solar production from the country. Senior Conservative MP Alicia Kearns is urging the UK government to \"sanction and [impose] a ban on any solar company with links to Uyghur forced labour from operating in the UK\". The US has accused the Chinese government of arbitrarily detaining more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang prison camps. In state-sponsored programmes, detainees are forced to produce goods including polysilicon, a core ingredient in solar panels, according to the US Department of Labor. The Chinese government has always staunchly denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Ms Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, told the BBC there was \"an ever-growing mass of evidence linking the solar industry to the forced labour and genocide of the Uyghur people in China\". The MP said the UK Ministry of Defence's \"exposure via solar investments is indicative of the scale of the issue, which will only get worse as the UK continues to lag behind international partners in acting\". Solar power is huge source of renewable energy and one of the cornerstones of the international effort to curb climate-warming carbon emissions. China has dominated the market and, according to the International Energy Agency, the country's global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeds 80%. It's a dilemma for the UK, which imports a large portion of its solar panels from China. The British Army's use of Chinese-made solar panels comes as no surprise to Yalkun Uluyol. An academic native of Xinjiang, Mr Uluyol has been researching the links between Chinese manufacturers and alleged forced labour in his home region. Mr Uluyol said his research found forced labour \"happens almost everywhere in every sector\". The evidence for this, he added, can be found in official Chinese records and the personal experiences of Uyghurs like members of his family. He said relatives - including his father - had been held in detention camps, with some \"taken away to work in facilities\". \"Green energy means respect for human rights and respect for the environment,\" Mr Uluyol said. \"Both are absent from the Uyghur region.\" Mr Uluyol's conclusions are shared by the US government, which has passed a law that requires companies to prove that goods imported from Xinjiang were not produced with forced labour. The US has been blocking shipments of solar energy components since passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2021. Project Prometheus began in the same year, as allegations of forced labour in solar supply chains came into sharper focus. The fourth and final site - which is using solar panels made by JA Solar, a Chinese company - was due to open at Rock Barracks in Suffolk this year. Asked to comment on the Sheffield Hallam report, Michael Parr, a solar expert who works with Qcells, said there was \"no doubt that the broad assessment was pretty fair\". \"It's really challenging to do an airtight independent audit in China,\" said Mr Parr, the executive director of the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance. \"It's difficult to get clear data from the companies. Most of the wafer supply comes from numerous companies and they often blend. Even companies who are buying polysilicon from the US and Europe are reliant on China.\" When told the British Army was using solar panels made by JA Solar, Trina and Qcells, Mr Parr said: \"Europe has been less attentive to the risk of forced labour in solar than the US\". He said he would \"differentiate\" between the three companies supplying panels for Project Prometheus. He said while Trina and JA Solar were Chinese manufacturers \"with the vast majority of their manufacturing\" in China, Qcells was a South Korean company that's \"done a lot of work on trying to clean up their supply chains\". In recent years, solar companies have taken steps to sever ties with Xinjiang. Some have diversified their production to cut out the region, while the solar industry has tried to improve its monitoring of supply chains. A spokesperson for JA Solar said the company was \"strongly committed to ensuring that our operations and supply chain are free from any form of forced labour\". \"JA Solar has due diligence mechanisms in place, reviews its suppliers and has several ongoing projects to further enhance the traceability of all JA Solar modules,\" it added.

Meade in Maryland, which houses U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. \"If anything, a 21st century warfare needs 21st century energy and resilience,\" said Col. Michael Sapp, the garrison commander of Fort Meade. Sapp told CBS News that means beefing up clean energy on base; solar panels now top nearly 60% of the housing there. Fort Meade also has plans to transform an empty landfill into a 60-acre solar farm, with a target date of 2026. The energy would help power the local grid, but also ensure the base is self-sufficient if the grid takes a hit. \"We can't afford to lose power. Losing power means we lose training, and we lose operations,\" Rachel Jacobson, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment, told CBS News. The Army's Climate Strategy includes building a microgrid on every base by 2035. The service is targeting 2030 for a 50% reduction in net greenhouse gas pollution and aims to get to zero emissions by 2050. \"We think it's doable,\" said Jacobson. \"We think that we certainly have the capacity on military installations to try innovative solutions and technologies to achieve these goals.\"\u00a0 \"We'd love to work with industry, academia, other federal agencies to try out new experimentation on military bases,\" she continued. At Fort Bragg in North Carolina, new innovation includes a floating solar array, the largest of its kind in the Southeast. Fort Carson in Colorado is working on new battery technology, and Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri has added electric vehicle charging stations. Jacobson says plans also include converting tactical vehicles to a fully electric fleet in coming decades, as well as building greener facilities.\u00a0 \"Part of our strategy is also to make our buildings smarter, to make our buildings more energy efficient when we're either renovating or designing a new building to make sure we have efficient backup systems, to make sure we're using sustainable building materials,\" she explained. Back at Fort Meade, Sgt. Brittany Washington currently lives in one of the apartment buildings topped with solar panels. \"I think it's amazing that they're allowing us to be a part of the change as the Army chooses to be more progressive,\" she said. As a solider and mother of three, she knows tackling climate change cannot wait. \"If we can get ahead of it now, then the future, of course, will be a better Army for it,\" Washington said.\u00a0 Natalie Brand is a political reporter in Washington D.C., covering the White House and Capitol Hill for CBS News 24/7 and Stations. \n\u00a9 2022 CBS Interactive Inc.

Meade in Maryland, which houses U.S. Cyber Command and the National Security Agency. \"If anything, a 21st century warfare needs 21st century energy and resilience,\" said Col. Michael Sapp, the garrison commander of Fort Meade. Sapp told CBS News that means beefing up clean energy on base; solar panels now top nearly 60% of the housing there. Fort Meade also has plans to transform an empty landfill into a 60-acre solar farm, with a target date of 2026. The energy would help power the local grid, but also ensure the base is self-sufficient if the grid takes a hit. \"We can't afford to lose power. Losing power means we lose training, and we lose operations,\" Rachel Jacobson, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations, Energy and Environment, told CBS News. The Army's Climate Strategy includes building a microgrid on every base by 2035. The service is targeting 2030 for a 50% reduction in net greenhouse gas pollution and aims to get to zero emissions by 2050. \"We think it's doable,\" said Jacobson. \"We think that we certainly have the capacity on military installations to try innovative solutions and technologies to achieve these goals.\"  \"We'd love to work with industry, academia, other federal agencies to try out new experimentation on military bases,\" she continued. At Fort Bragg in North Carolina, new innovation includes a floating solar array, the largest of its kind in the Southeast. Fort Carson in Colorado is working on new battery technology, and Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri has added electric vehicle charging stations. Jacobson says plans also include converting tactical vehicles to a fully electric fleet in coming decades, as well as building greener facilities.  \"Part of our strategy is also to make our buildings smarter, to make our buildings more energy efficient when we're either renovating or designing a new building to make sure we have efficient backup systems, to make sure we're using sustainable building materials,\" she explained. Back at Fort Meade, Sgt. Brittany Washington currently lives in one of the apartment buildings topped with solar panels. \"I think it's amazing that they're allowing us to be a part of the change as the Army chooses to be more progressive,\" she said. As a solider and mother of three, she knows tackling climate change cannot wait. \"If we can get ahead of it now, then the future, of course, will be a better Army for it,\" Washington said.",

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nApril 23, 2021 / 10:20 AM EDT\n          / CBS News\n         The climate crisis is arguably the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced, and to limit warming to manageable levels, time is our biggest opponent. While the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner renewable energy is now gaining steam, the pace is simply not fast enough to head off the harmful impacts that are\u00a0already being felt\u00a0throughout the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \"Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5\u00baC\" \u2014 the international community's benchmark guide to averting climate disaster \u2014 says to reach the goal of staying below 1.5\u00baC of warming requires \"rapid and far-reaching transitions\" in our energy, industrial and other systems that would be \"unprecedented in scale.\" In other words, the task is herculean.\u00a0 So, many experts say drastic times call for drastic measures, arguing that technology like climate geoengineering should be part of the solution toolkit. Proponents say that while switching to renewable energy, driving electric vehicles and restoring forests can get us far, that's simply not enough. The IPCC agrees, and cites one specific type of geoengineering \u2014 carbon capture and sequestration \u2014 as a necessary part of the suite of solutions. While carbon capture \u2014 a process of trapping, compressing and then storing away harmful emissions to keep them out of the atmosphere \u2014 has its share of detractors, the climate community generally accepts that it will be necessary, though the extent to which it can and should be used is hotly debated.\u00a0 But that debate pales in comparison to the controversy provoked by another proposed type of geoengineering known as Solar Radiation Management, in which humans would artificially dim the sun. That idea is loaded with compelling physical and ethical considerations which will be explored below. Since the Industrial Revolution, the burning of fossil fuels has released 1.6 trillion tons of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased by 50% \u2014 at a pace 100 times faster than it naturally should. As a result, our planet is now warming\u00a010 times faster than it has in 65 million years. The scale and speed is unprecedented. Despite advances in clean energy like wind and solar, the world still gets 80% of its energy from fossil fuels. Because it is integrated into almost every nook and cranny of modern life, the challenge of eliminating carbon from our energy system is monumental. And even if humanity can significantly slow or even stop emitting carbon pollution, carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere for hundreds or even thousands of years. The only way to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations is to pull the carbon back out of the atmosphere.\u00a0 In order to do that, there are natural solutions like forest restoration as well as technical solutions like carbon capture systems. A\u00a02017 research paper, led by the Nature Conservancy, found that natural climate solutions like restoring forests, wetlands and grasslands can, in a best-case scenario, provide 37% of the CO2 mitigation needed to keep humanity below the upper goal (2\u00baC of warming) of the Paris Agreement. That's significant, but not enough.\u00a0 Chad Frischmann, the senior director of research and technology at\u00a0Project Drawdown, a climate solutions organization, prefers if society concentrates on developing ways to get nature to do the work.\u00a0 \"Overall, these natural forms of 'carbon capture' are tried, true and cost effective. More importantly, they have a ton of cascading benefits to agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and the health of the planet,\" he said. But carbon capture specialists like Dr. Julio Friedmann, a global energy policy expert from Columbia University \u2014 known as @CarbonWrangler on Twitter \u2014 believe technological solutions should have a bigger role to play because even if we shift to clean energy there are certain industrial processes, like cement and steel making, that cannot easily be decarbonized. As is clear from his Twitter handle, Friedmann is bullish on carbon removal \u2014 not as a replacement for other solutions, but as a complement to them.\u00a0 \"CO2 removal is one mitigation strategy. It is a mitigation strategy like efficiency, renewables, electric vehicles. It is just one of the many things that we will do,\" he said. \"But if we do everything we know how to do today there's always this fat residual 10 billion tons a year that we have no solutions for.\" Carbon capture \u2014 often referred to as CCUS, for carbon capture, utilization and storage \u2014 is an industrial process by which carbon dioxide is absorbed during power generation and industrial processes and stored away, typically underground, sometimes utilized for enhanced oil recovery or used in certain manufactured goods.\u00a0 Globally, there are about 50 large-scale CCUS plants, including 10 currently operating in the U.S.\u00a0 A less common but growing method is called direct air capture (DAC), in which carbon dioxide is sucked right out of the air through the use of large fans. There are currently only 15 DAC facilities worldwide which capture only 9,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. Some larger facilities are planned. The Swiss company Climeworks is building a DAC plant in Iceland capable of capturing 4,000 tons, and the American petroleum giant Occidental plans a much more\u00a0ambitious facility in the West Texas Permian Basin which it says will capture 1 million tons of CO2 a year. Collectively all these CCUS and DAC facilities have the capacity to capture about 40 million tons of carbon dioxide yearly. It sounds like a lot, until you consider that each year humans emit almost 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere \u20141,000 times more than we can capture \u2014 to say nothing about all the CO2 that is already up there as a result of the Industrial Revolution. To put it bluntly, critics say CCUS and DAC are not ready for prime-time and may never be. The processes are very expensive, they consume copious amounts of energy themselves \u2014 often, ironically, produced by burning fossil fuels \u2014 and their capacity is just a tiny fraction of what's needed. Frischmann said, \"They will never scale to the level necessary to offset fossil fuel emissions, and will take 20 years of 20% annual growth to even start making a dent in the atmosphere. Highly unlikely rate of growth.\" He's also concerned about the moral hazard of promoting carbon capture as a solution, because he says these \"false silver bullets\" mean emitters can keep emitting with the promise that technology will suck up all their pollution. \"Attention to them now allows fossil fuel companies, and their cronies, to continue business-as-usual with the promise of a Band-Aid that is not materializing anytime soon,\" Frischmann said. But Friedmann disagrees. He believes good policies can help carbon capture scale up quickly.\u00a0 \"It's not a technology challenge, it's a finance challenge,\" he said. \"It's helpful to think about these things like solar in 2002. Solar electricity in 2002 was expensive, not mass produced. And then there was this set of policy and innovation pushes that really dropped the price and helped commercialization.\" He also feels that mopping up our mess is a moral responsibility.\u00a0 \"If you accept that we should remove CO2 from the air and oceans, it is essentially a way of addressing prior wrongs. It's a way of the Global North announcing its intentions to clean up its mess and say we are going to do this so the Global South doesn't have to.\" Peter Kalmus (@ClimateHuman), a NASA climate scientist, says he supports the concept of carbon capture and thinks we should keep researching it, but he is \"extremely skeptical it will ever be possible or helpful.\" He thinks it should not be included in planning until we know it can be done at scale.\u00a0 Kalmus puts it colorfully: \"I feel the IPCC stepped way out of bounds in normalizing it in greenhouse gas budgets and scenarios. They may as well have included genies, fairies, and pixies in their scenarios.\"\u00a0 Kalmus shares a concern with many others in the climate community that focusing on carbon capture will distract us from the real work of getting off fossil fuels. He said, \"The most compelling 'con' to me is that it will be used by politicians, decision-makers, and the public to reduce the urgency and delay timescales for addressing what is surely the greatest emergency facing humanity.\" But clearly the two arguments are not mutually exclusive: carbon capture can both be used as a delay tactic and also be a necessary part of the solution.\u00a0 President Biden's ambitious climate agenda aims to bolster the U.S. carbon capture capacity, not only to clean up the environment but also to create jobs. His $2 trillion infrastructure plan includes funding for carbon recapture plants. This is a rare area of agreement for Democrats and Republicans and may be a necessary inclusion to help garner support across the aisle. It's even won support\u00a0from the United Mine Workers of America, which backed incentives for using carbon capture technology along with measures to protect jobs in coal country. If the idea of artificially dimming the sun to minimize global warming seems like science fiction, you wouldn't be alone in that opinion. It is certainly fraught with potential dangers and unknowns. But the concept is actually rather simple technologically, and relatively inexpensive. The challenges are not so much technical or financial, they are political and ethical. Proponents\u00a0like Bill Gates\u00a0say solar geoengineering could buy humanity time to transition over to renewable energy. Opponents argue there are a multitude of concerns about the potential consequences. Solar geoengineering proposals go by various names, including Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI). The idea is to\u00a0fly specialized planes into the stratosphere, more than 50,000 feet above Earth's surface, and unload small aerosol particles (like sulfates) which would block some of the sunlight from reaching the Earth. Because atmospheric winds are all connected, the suspended particles would circulate the globe. Less sun equals less heating. Theoretically, the amount of cooling could be controlled by managing the amount and distribution of aerosols the planes deliver. As long as the particles are up there, the cooling would continue. There is also a less talked-about option called Marine Cloud Brightening. It's somewhat similar in that particles are injected, but this time into clouds to make them brighter, whiter and more able to reflect sunlight back into space before it heats the Earth. Proposals suggest spraying sea salt aerosols from vessels into marine clouds. Those particles would act as condensation nuclei allowing more cloud droplets to form, blocking more sun. Here the impacts here would be more regional, not global.\u00a0 Both types of solar geoengineering are explained below, in an illustration from the\u00a0Union of Concerned Scientists. Scientists know SAI could lower temperatures because a natural version of it is on display for all to see and measure when big volcanoes, like Mout Pinatubo in the Philippines, erupt and spew sulfates high up into the stratosphere.\u00a0 In 2001, Pinatubo injected about 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, where it formed a hazy layer of aerosol particles composed primarily of sulfuric acid droplets. This blocked enough sunlight to reduce the planet's temperature by 1\u00baF over the course of 1 to 2 years. \"The technical challenges for stratospheric aerosol geoengineering are not great, all that is needed is a new, high-altitude jet that could carry tons of material into the lower stratosphere, about 60,000 feet up,\" explains Peter Irvine, a professor of solar geoengineering at University College London. \u00a0 Specialized planes would be needed because the air is much thinner at that high altitude. Irvine believes it's a cost-effective option to consider given the severity of the crisis facing the planet. \"Developing and running a fleet of such aircraft would cost a few billion dollars per year initially, which is small compared to the projected damages of climate change or to the costs of decarbonizing the economy,\" he said. A 2018\u00a0paper estimates the upfront cost for development of one such aircraft would be $2 to $3 billion, and maintaining a fleet of planes making 4,000 worldwide missions per year would cost around $2 to $2.5 billion per year\u00a0over the first 15 years. Frischmann says it's the affordability that scares him. \"It is cheap, and this is scary. There are any number of billionaires, corporations or small states with the wealth to inject enough sulfate into the stratosphere to cause irreparable damage. Chilling thought,\" he said. The damage that might be caused by tampering with the atmosphere is debatable and unknown because there simply hasn't been much real-world research done. That's partly because any atmospheric modification, or even the consideration of it, is highly controversial.\u00a0 A major concern among many climate scientists is the chance of unintended consequences from artificially cooling the Earth with aerosols. Could it cause floods in one nation and droughts in another? Will it weaken the ozone layer? Will it\u00a0hurt species or ecosystems? Could it be used unilaterally as a weapon by one nation to inflict climate damage on another? Some of these hypotheticals may be more likely than others, but these are questions that can only be answered by research. Its ability to raise alarm was on display a few weeks ago. A very small research project called SCoPEx, by a group of Harvard researchers, which was scheduled for this summer, was just postponed until at least 2022. To illustrate how divisive the concept is, the team wasn't even spraying any aerosols \u2014 just testing equipment. Regardless, Swedish environmental organizations and the Indigenous Saami Council sent a letter demanding the project be canceled, calling the plan a real moral hazard and saying the technology entails risks of catastrophic consequences. The Harvard advisory committee put it on hold, pending further societal engagement. While Irvine is bullish on SIA's \"potential to reduce the risks of climate change if used as a complement to emissions cuts,\" he is quick to point out that a much better understanding is needed: \"We don't know enough about its potential, limits and risks to make recommendations on whether or not to deploy it. Research is needed to better understand its potential physical consequences, as well as to understand the broader social and political challenges it poses.\" In 2019, the U.S. government allotted $4 million for stratospheric monitoring and research efforts. The program includes assessments of solar climate interventions such as proposals to inject material into the stratosphere. A year ago, Irvine and Dr. David Keith, another well-known expert in solar geoengineering, published a paper looking into the effectiveness and potential side effects of SAI. In a geoengineering model study, the team found that halving warming with stratospheric aerosol geoengineering could potentially reduce key climate hazards and would have limited regional side effects. But a limited model study is not nearly enough to base these monumental decisions on. Recently, solar geoengineering supporters got a boost from a powerful scientific organization. Given the urgency of the risks posed by climate change, the\u00a0National Academy of Sciences recommended that the U.S. government should cautiously pursue a research program for solar geoengineering, with funding in the $100 to $200 million range over 5 years.\u00a0 But even if solar geoengineering worked to cool temperatures, it would do nothing for the problem of ocean acidification, because it does not address the root cause of the warming \u2014 the carbon dioxide which traps heat and dissolves in the ocean to make waters more acidic. For all these reasons, many in the climate community believe the cons outweigh the potential pros.\u00a0 \"In short, do not try to fix a global, catastrophic problem with a Band-Aid that no one knows will work as intended, or knows what long-term unintended damage can be done to the planet,\" said Frischmann.\u00a0 Kalmus sees the value in researching solar geoengineering, but says the fact that we are even contemplating it evokes visions of a dystopian future. He goes further by discussing what is likely the most risky aspect of SAI.\u00a0 \"Solar geoengineering has an even darker aspect which is that the moment society stopped doing it, for whatever reason, there would be a rapid spike in global mean temperature, which is an extraordinarily dangerous prospect,\" he said.\u00a0 In other words, if the world used SAI to hold down temperatures for 30 years, and then stopped, almost immediately temperatures would spike the whole 30 years worth of warming in a year or two \u2014 with possibly devastating consequences for ecosystems and species that could not immediately adapt. \"It is a last resort lever to be pulled under the most dire circumstances for life on the planet. There is not a scenario where I see this as needed,\" Frischmann urges. As an expert in solutions, he points instead to a more holistic set of changes we could make to energy use, industry, transportation, agriculture and other sectors that are\u00a0supported by research.\u00a0 Kalmus sees resorting to extreme geoengineering solutions as lazy and selfish.\u00a0 \"Saying either 'we'll figure out and do carbon capture later this century' or 'we'll cool the planet with aerosols' is negligently irresponsible, and basically says, 'We old people can keep consuming and polluting, we'll force our kids to pay the price.' It's intergenerational genocide.\" Jeff Berardelli is a meteorologist and climate specialist for CBS News. \n\u00a9 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

It's a way of the Global North announcing its intentions to clean up its mess and say we are going to do this so the Global South doesn't have to.\"\n\nPeter Kalmus (@ClimateHuman), a NASA climate scientist, says he supports the concept of carbon capture and thinks we should keep researching it, but he is \"extremely skeptical it will ever be possible or helpful.\" He thinks it should not be included in planning until we know it can be done at scale.\n\nKalmus puts it colorfully: \"I feel the IPCC stepped way out of bounds in normalizing it in greenhouse gas budgets and scenarios. They may as well have included genies, fairies, and pixies in their scenarios.\"\n\nKalmus shares a concern with many others in the climate community that focusing on carbon capture will distract us from the real work of getting off fossil fuels. He said, \"The most compelling 'con' to me is that it will be used by politicians, decision-makers, and the public to reduce the urgency and delay timescales for addressing what is surely the greatest emergency facing humanity.\"\n\nBut clearly the two arguments are not mutually exclusive: carbon capture can both be used as a delay tactic and also be a necessary part of the solution.\n\nPresident Biden's ambitious climate agenda aims to bolster the U.S. carbon capture capacity, not only to clean up the environment but also to create jobs. His $2 trillion infrastructure plan includes funding for carbon recapture plants. This is a rare area of agreement for Democrats and Republicans and may be a necessary inclusion to help garner support across the aisle. It's even won support from the United Mine Workers of America, which backed incentives for using carbon capture technology along with measures to protect jobs in coal country.\n\nIf the idea of artificially dimming the sun to minimize global warming seems like science fiction, you wouldn't be alone in that opinion. It is certainly fraught with potential dangers and unknowns. But the concept is actually rather simple technologically, and relatively inexpensive. The challenges are not so much technical or financial, they are political and ethical.\n\nProponents like Bill Gates say solar geoengineering could buy humanity time to transition over to renewable energy. Opponents argue there are a multitude of concerns about the potential consequences.\n\nSolar geoengineering proposals go by various names, including Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI). The idea is to fly specialized planes into the stratosphere, more than 50,000 feet above Earth's surface, and unload small aerosol particles (like sulfates) which would block some of the sunlight from reaching the Earth.\n\nBecause atmospheric winds are all connected, the suspended particles would circulate the globe. Less sun equals less heating. Theoretically, the amount of cooling could be controlled by managing the amount and distribution of aerosols the planes deliver. As long as the particles are up there, the cooling would continue.\n\nThere is also a less talked-about option called Marine Cloud Brightening. It's somewhat similar in that particles are injected, but this time into clouds to make them brighter, whiter and more able to reflect sunlight back into space before it heats the Earth. Proposals suggest spraying sea salt aerosols from vessels into marine clouds. Those particles would act as condensation nuclei allowing more cloud droplets to form, blocking more sun. Here the impacts here would be more regional, not global.\n\nBoth types of solar geoengineering are explained below, in an illustration from the Union of Concerned Scientists.\n\nScientists know SAI could lower temperatures because a natural version of it is on display for all to see and measure when big volcanoes, like Mout Pinatubo in the Philippines, erupt and spew sulfates high up into the stratosphere.\n\nIn 2001, Pinatubo injected about 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, where it formed a hazy layer of aerosol particles composed primarily of sulfuric acid droplets. This blocked enough sunlight to reduce the planet's temperature by 1\u00baF over the course of 1 to 2 years.\n\n\"The technical challenges for stratospheric aerosol geoengineering are not great, all that is needed is a new, high-altitude jet that could carry tons of material into the lower stratosphere, about 60,000 feet up,\" explains Peter Irvine, a professor of solar geoengineering at University College London.\n\nSpecialized planes would be needed because the air is much thinner at that high altitude. Irvine believes it's a cost-effective option to consider given the severity of the crisis facing the planet.\n\n\"Developing and running a fleet of such aircraft would cost a few billion dollars per year initially, which is small compared to the projected damages of climate change or to the costs of decarbonizing the economy,\" he said.\n\nA 2018 paper estimates the upfront cost for development of one such aircraft would be $2 to $3 billion, and maintaining a fleet of planes making 4,000 worldwide missions per year would cost around $2 to $2.5 billion per year over the first 15 years.\n\nFrischmann says it's the affordability that scares him.\n\n\"It is cheap, and this is scary. There are any number of billionaires, corporations or small states with the wealth to inject enough sulfate into the stratosphere to cause irreparable damage. Chilling thought,\" he said.\n\nThe damage that might be caused by tampering with the atmosphere is debatable and unknown because there simply hasn't been much real-world research done. That's partly because any atmospheric modification, or even the consideration of it, is highly controversial.\n\nA major concern among many climate scientists is the chance of unintended consequences from artificially cooling the Earth with aerosols. Could it cause floods in one nation and droughts in another? Will it weaken the ozone layer? Will it hurt species or ecosystems? Could it be used unilaterally as a weapon by one nation to inflict climate damage on another?\n\nSome of these hypotheticals may be more likely than others, but these are questions that can only be answered by research.\n\nIts ability to raise alarm was on display a few weeks ago. A very small research project called SCoPEx, by a group of Harvard researchers, which was scheduled for this summer, was just postponed until at least 2022. To illustrate how divisive the concept is, the team wasn't even spraying any aerosols \u2014 just testing equipment. Regardless, Swedish environmental organizations and the Indigenous Saami Council sent a letter demanding the project be canceled, calling the plan a real moral hazard and saying the technology entails risks of catastrophic consequences.\n\nThe Harvard advisory committee put it on hold, pending further societal engagement.\n\nWhile Irvine is bullish on SIA's \"potential to reduce the risks of climate change if used as a complement to emissions cuts,\" he is quick to point out that a much better understanding is needed: \"We don't know enough about its potential, limits and risks to make recommendations on whether or not to deploy it. Research is needed to better understand its potential physical consequences, as well as to understand the broader social and political challenges it poses.\"\n\nIn 2019, the U.S. government allotted $4 million for stratospheric monitoring and research efforts. The program includes assessments of solar climate interventions such as proposals to inject material into the stratosphere.\n\nA year ago, Irvine and Dr. David Keith, another well-known expert in solar geoengineering, published a paper looking into the effectiveness and potential side effects of SAI. In a geoengineering model study, the team found that halving warming with stratospheric aerosol geoengineering could potentially reduce key climate hazards and would have limited regional side effects.\n\nBut a limited model study is not nearly enough to base these monumental decisions on.\n\nRecently, solar geoengineering supporters got a boost from a powerful scientific organization. Given the urgency of the risks posed by climate change, the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the U.S. government should cautiously pursue a research program for solar geoengineering, with funding in the $100 to $200 million range over 5 years.\n\nBut even if solar geoengineering worked to cool temperatures, it would do nothing for the problem of ocean acidification, because it does not address the root cause of the warming \u2014 the carbon dioxide which traps heat and dissolves in the ocean to make waters more acidic.\n\nFor all these reasons, many in the climate community believe the cons outweigh the potential pros.\n\n\"In short, do not try to fix a global, catastrophic problem with a Band-Aid that no one knows will work as intended, or knows what long-term unintended damage can be done to the planet,\" said Frischmann.\n\nKalmus sees the value in researching solar geoengineering, but says the fact that we are even contemplating it evokes visions of a dystopian future. He goes further by discussing what is likely the most risky aspect of SAI.\n\n\"Solar geoengineering has an even darker aspect which is that the moment society stopped doing it, for whatever reason, there would be a rapid spike in global mean temperature, which is an extraordinarily dangerous prospect,\" he said.\n\nIn other words, if the world used SAI to hold down temperatures for 30 years, and then stopped, almost immediately temperatures would spike the whole 30 years worth of warming in a year or two \u2014 with possibly devastating consequences for ecosystems and species that could not immediately adapt.\n\n\"It is a last resort lever to be pulled under the most dire circumstances for life on the planet. There is not a scenario where I see this as needed,\" Frischmann urges.\n\nAs an expert in solutions, he points instead to a more holistic set of changes we could make to energy use, industry, transportation, agriculture and other sectors that are supported by research.\n\nKalmus sees resorting to extreme geoengineering solutions as lazy and selfish.\n\n\"Saying either 'we'll figure out and do carbon capture later this century' or 'we'll cool the planet with aerosols' is negligently irresponsible, and basically says, 'We old people can keep consuming and polluting, we'll force our kids to pay the price.' It's intergenerational genocide.\"",

        "text": "Watch CBS News \nUpdated on:  May 13, 2025 / 11:34 PM EDT\n          / CBS New York\n         An icon in the solar industry left customers scrambling after they filed for bankruptcy. After\u00a0CBS News New York investigator Mahsa Saeidi helped get a New Jersey family's solar panels fixed, her inbox was flooded with similar complaints. She spoke to the company's new CEO to help find solutions for the thousands of families impacted. Maria and Louis Pinneri's golden years have been shaded by a broken solar panel system. In 2011, the Staten Island couple leased it through SunPower, a giant in the industry. In March 2023, they say it broke \u2013 specifically, the inverter, which converts electricity generated by the sun into electricity appropriate for the grid.   \"And they told us as soon as we get the new meter, we're going to replace it,\" Louis Pinneri said. \"And I never heard it from them again.\" \u00a0 \"No phone calls, no emails,\" Maria Pinneri said. \"Two and a half years of no help from these people.\" The Pinneris say they watched their electric bill spike. On a fixed income, they say they had no choice but to stop making payments on the panels. Then, in August 2024, with their system still not working, SunPower collapsed. Louis Pinneri says it's been \"a nightmare.\" \"I'm 77 years old already,\" he said. \"If something happens to me, I don't want to leave a mess to my family.\" When Maria Pinneri tried to call for an update on the status of their meter, an operator first told her they weren't able to speak with her regarding the account because it was under Louis Pinneri's name. After Saeidi got on the phone and asked when a team could come to the Pinneris' home, the SunStrong Management rep said, \"There's a backlog due to the bankruptcy and SunPower customers coming in.\" Soon after, Saeidi spoke with the general counsel of SunStrong Management. SunStrong was hired by the third-party companies that lease the solar panels to families, including the Pinneris. They say they're working on clearing the backlog. Eventually, a crew with SunStrong Management came through, ensuring the Pinneris' panels are once again powered up. \"Between all the emails and phone calls I made and got no results, I called you and here we are,\" Maria Pinneri told Saeidi. \"And it's now fixed.\" The Pinneris aren't the only ones struggling. One woman told CBS News New York her electric bill is now over $5,000, and another customer who stopped making payments on the panels said, \"My credit is ruined.\" Complete Solar Corporation CEO T.J. Rodgers bought part of SunPower's assets in the bankruptcy, including the \"SunPower\" brand and related intellectual property. \"My little dwarf company bought the mighty SunPower for 45 million bucks,\" he said. \"I expect that company to be worth a billion dollars shortly.\" The assets he purchased exclude any interest in leases, systems, batteries or equipment installed before Sept. 30, 2024. While Rodgers says the new SunPower isn't liable or responsible, he's working to help customers. \"They had over 100,000 batteries in the field, and the batteries decided not to work,\" he said. \"We have a solution, a temporary solution that will keep those batteries running safely.\" Rodgers says to troubleshoot battery issues, \"You have to talk to it.\" The problem, he says, is that SunPower had created a proprietary connection. \"So one of the keys to the realm is we're going to have to put in a standard communication link that is well-known and works interchangeably in multiple systems,\" Rodgers said. \"That is part of a permanent solution. That is going to cost $900 ... and there's no way around that.\" Rodgers says broken panels and inverters both have a long warranty. \"Panels have the longest warranty of any solar product,\" he said. \"So the two most expensive components of the system can be covered by a passthrough warranty.\" Rodgers says in recent months, dozens of small to mid-size solar installers, contractors and companies have failed. \"It is an industry that has pretty much collapsed,\" he said. \"And the other problem, I'll just tell you, is the government ... 'Oh, we can't do it because we can't get this vote through. Oh, we're going to pay for a part of your system, we're not going to pay for part of your system.' And those jerk-arounds take a toll.\" Meanwhile, even if your system is broken, you are likely still obligated to make payments on the panels. That information will be in your lease agreement. SunStrong Management says they're letting customers defer payments until their systems are back up and running. For the tens of thousands of customers with broken batteries, Rodgers says there's a number you can call to find out more about a temporary solution. There's also a permanent solution, though that one will cost you. To learn more, call\u00a01-877-299-4943.
