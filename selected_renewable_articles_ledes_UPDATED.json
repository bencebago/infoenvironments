        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we’re committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it’s hard. That kind of journalism isn’t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Coal, oil, and natural gas producers have found their vision for a low-carbon world. HOUSTON, Texas — In a video message projected onto massive screens in a packed conference hall, Sultan al-Jaber, the president of the COP28 climate conference held in the United Arab Emirates last year, graciously accepted a leadership award from one of the world’s biggest energy industry conventions.  Al-Jaber, who when not running UN climate summits is also the CEO of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, faced criticism from environmental groups for inviting major oil and gas companies to participate in the international climate negotiations. He also faced scrutiny for his comments that it’s not necessary to eliminate fossil fuels to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century. But here in Houston, before a much friendlier crowd, he remained defiant.  “If the world is going to meet its climate goals, every stakeholder has to act,” al-Jaber said, with a model of a wind turbine on his desk. “Everyone had a seat at the table, everyone was invited to contribute, and everyone did contribute.”  CERAWeek by S&P Global — an annual conference of oil, gas, coal, renewable, and nuclear energy industries — returned the invitation, putting the once taboo topic of climate change in its headline.  “It is no exaggeration to say that [al-Jaber] helped the global community chart pathways to a sustainable future,” said Daniel Yergin, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning oil history The Prize and the founder of CERAWeek. The conference isn’t meant to produce any formal agreements or treaties, but what attendees say on stage and behind closed doors often ripple through the global energy industry.  While only a sliver of the size of the last climate meeting — more than 8,000 delegates were at CERAWeek compared to more than 80,000 attendees at COP28 — the conference represents some of the most powerful companies in the world with trillions of dollars at their disposal to shape the future of global energy and the climate. The theme this year was “Multidimensional Energy Transition: Markets, climate, technology and geopolitics.” The unwieldy title is an example of how the convention has grown in scope since it started in 1981 and how the industries it represents have begun to redefine their roles in a world constrained by rising average temperatures, yet still primarily dependent on fossil fuels. What was once a low-key meeting of oil and gas executives and analysts to talk frankly and cut deals has become a slick news-making tech conference where attendees are well fed and, after hours, well lubricated by sponsors. Think of it as Davos for the oil and gas set, hosted in the energy capital of the US. “Twenty years ago you could not have a conversation here about climate change. Full stop,” Mark Brownstein, senior vice president for energy transition at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), who has attended the conference for decades, told Vox.  By now everyone at CERAWeek has gotten the memo on global warming and understood the assignment, at least in rhetoric. The world’s largest energy firms have come to a general consensus that the world is shifting toward clean energy — but that fossil fuels are still going to be necessary for the foreseeable future. “These truths are not in conflict,” said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. “The momentum of the clean energy transition is undeniable, even as we are the largest producer of oil and gas in the world.”  Every talk and panel discussion nodded to the energy transition, toward carbon management, efficiency, and clean tech. When it comes to energy sources — wind, solar, hydropower, natural gas, oil, hydrogen, coal, nuclear, geothermal, and even fusion — CERAWeek has truly embraced diversity, equity, and inclusion.  But even with greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere reaching levels not seen in eons and after the hottest year humans have ever measured, the fossil fuel industry whose products are driving climate change sees a bright future for itself. After all, despite the extraordinary expansion of clean energy generation, fossil fuels have only lost a small share of the global energy mix and are still expecting more growth.  The majors believe that technologies like carbon capture and storage will allow them to continue selling their wares as emissions regulations ratchet down, and that power-devouring technologies like artificial intelligence and growing markets in developing countries will continue to raise demand. By some estimates, data center electricity use is on track to more than double by 2026. Coal, oil, and natural gas consumption are at or near record highs in many parts of the world and their emissions are currently on track to grow through 2050, according to the Energy Information Administration. The world is hungry for BTUs and watts, and the energy industry is eager to serve them.  “I’m actually more optimistic today than I’ve ever been in this job,” ExxonMobil CEO Darren Woods told attendees, noting that COP28 was the first climate conference he has ever attended. But that optimism hasn’t been matched with urgency on climate change, and the industry has a long history of slowing progress. While the language has changed more recently, the oil and gas industry has spent decades thwarting action on climate change, with lobbying, litigation, and misinformation. Exxon’s own scientists produced accurate internal forecasts of rising average temperatures as early as the 1970s while the company published full-page ads in newspapers casting doubt on warming into the late 1990s.  Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine has also put energy security back on the front burner. For some countries, energy security today matters more than climate change tomorrow, leading them to prioritize secure sources, including fossil fuels in some cases. (Energy security wasn’t the only echo of the war — CERAWeek also helpfully reminded participants in its registration form not to attend if they are subject to sanctions.)  So while appetites for cleaner energy sources are growing, the stalwarts of the global energy industry have made it clear they aren’t letting go of the fuels that powered their rise. As these companies have grudgingly come to acknowledge climate change, many concerned about global warming have also begun to grapple with the likelihood that fossil fuels aren’t fading away anytime soon. And while most energy companies do envision reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, the current pace is nowhere near fast enough to bend the curve to meet climate goals. The future for the global energy industry is not just brighter, but hotter.  Across the skybridge from the hotel in the neighboring convention center, CERAWeek hosts what it calls Innovation Agora, where tech entrepreneurs and energy startups pitch their solutions to climate change in glass-walled booths under purple lights. It was once the kids’ table of the conference when it launched in 2017 but has since evolved into a parallel production, a clear reflection of clean energy’s massive growth and immense potential.  “Globally, clean energy investment has overtaken fossil fuel investment every year since 2016, according to the IEA,” Granholm said. “In the US, clean energy investment has tripled since 2018.” The fossil fuel industry talks less about competition between conventional sources and renewables and more about collaboration between the “molecule” and the “electron” solution set, as Exxon’s Woods described it. The molecules are the hydrocarbons of coal, oil, and gas and increasingly, hydrogen, while the electrons are those generated by solar panels and wind turbines.  “I’m not suggesting one’s better than the other one,” Woods said. “What I’m suggesting is, we need both, and you need companies who have our scale, our capabilities.”  Unsurprisingly, the “molecule” companies have their eyes set on the technologies that play to their strengths. Hydrogen, a gas most commonly produced by reforming methane, fits well into the fossil fuel industry’s existing refining, pipeline, storage, and retail infrastructure. Geothermal, which harnesses heat from beneath the Earth’s surface, draws on the sector’s expertise in geology and drilling. Carbon capture — from smokestacks, from the ocean, from the air — gives fossil fuels a way to zero out their emissions, at least on paper, extending them a lifeline in a world where emissions must ratchet down. In the US, the Biden administration has set a target of cutting national greenhouse gas emissions in half compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050.  US government incentives are sweetening the deal for cleaner energy technologies. The trio of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act have mobilized billions of dollars to research, build, and deploy low-emissions energy systems and the products that enable them. Unlike past legislative attempts to tackle climate change, these laws are almost all incentives, with no restrictions or caps on greenhouse gases baked in.  “I am very supportive of the IRA, because, as legislated, the IRA focuses on carbon intensity and in theory, [is] technology agnostic,” Woods said. As for the villains, the energy industry as well as environmental groups found a common adversary in methane. It’s about 30 times more powerful than carbon dioxide when it comes to trapping heat in the atmosphere. It’s the dominant component of natural gas, so producers do have an incentive to limit its leaks since it’s a salable product. At COP28, dozens of oil and gas firms committed to ending their methane pollution by 2050. Simply reducing methane output by 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 could avert 0.2°C of warming (0.36°F) by 2050. But methane is colorless and odorless, making it hard to detect where it’s escaping, and estimates of its emissions vary widely.  These concerns have fertilized the growth of the carbon accounting and verification business. Context Labs, one of the companies presenting at the Agora, has developed software so companies can track emissions across their facilities, sometimes down to individual pieces of hardware like generators or furnaces. The goal is to give companies actionable information about where they need to cut pollution, how they can route their operations to be more carbon efficient, and what assets will be at risk when emissions regulations get stricter.  Not everyone is ready to take these companies at their word, though. The Environmental Defense Fund launched a satellite to track global methane emissions just a few days before CERAWeek began and advertised it on the streets of Houston. EDF plans to publish its findings publicly to spur polluters to act.  There were still points of friction at the oil-soaked conference, as explained by Amin Nasser, president and CEO of Saudi Aramco. It’s not just the world’s largest oil company, with nearly four times the market capitalization of ExxonMobil; it’s the fourth-mightiest of all companies, shaping economies around the world. And as a mostly state-run enterprise under an autocratic regime, Saudi Aramco isn’t as swayed by activists or shareholders as a fully investor-owned company like Exxon.  Nasser laid out what he called five “hard realities” for the energy transition.  The first is that alternatives to hydrocarbons like wind and solar energy have received decades of research and development and billions of dollars in investment, but still hold single-digit market shares. Second, reducing the carbon intensity of fossil fuels — particularly through energy efficiency and switching from coal and oil to natural gas — has delivered greater greenhouse gas emissions reductions than the rise of clean energy. Third is that many alternative energy strategies like electric vehicles are unaffordable for a majority of people around the world. That ties into the fourth point, that most of global energy demand growth in the coming years will occur in developing countries. But despite representing 85 percent of the world’s population, these countries receive a tiny fraction of clean energy investment.  Nasser concluded with his fifth point: that the energy transition strategy of replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy needs a reset. “We should abandon the fantasy of phasing out oil and gas and instead invest in them adequately, reflecting realistic demand assumptions,” Nasser said to widespread applause. “We should ramp up our effort to reduce carbon emissions, improve efficiency and introduce lower carbon solutions. And we should phase in new energy sources and technologies when they are genuinely ready, economically competitive, and with the right infrastructure.”  Many activists and other in the energy industry disagree with Nasser’s assessment. However, his comments echo the ongoing rifts at COP meetings between major fossil fuel-producing countries that became rich off oil and those often poorer countries facing the immediate effects of climate change like sea level rise, who want to see fossil fuel consumption zeroed out. It’s led to long, tortuous negotiations over language like “phase down” versus “phase out” and “unabated” emissions from fossil fuels.  But while many zero-carbon technologies are still expensive, so too are the systems required to keep burning coal, oil, and gas in a world where emissions must halt by the middle of the century to meet climate targets. Some of the cheapest carbon capture technologies to date still cost about $40 per metric ton of carbon dioxide, adding up to billions of dollars to capture any meaningful share of the 37.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emitted last year.  The US, now the world’s largest oil producer and natural gas exporter, is also in an awkward spot. While pledging to reduce its own emissions, the US is anticipating more fossil fuel exports and financing import facilities in other countries. That includes a doubling of liquefied natural gas shipments abroad by 2030, despite the White House’s pause on new export terminals. “The whole world needs to transition away from fossil fuels, but in the meantime, we still have to support our friends and allies in their energy needs,” John Podesta, the White House climate adviser who also leads climate diplomacy, told reporters.  Now in an election year, the Biden administration is trying to walk the line between taking credit for low gasoline prices and facilitating more fossil fuel extraction as it faces a challenger who wants to ramp up coal, oil, and natural gas, potentially adding another 4 billion metric tons by 2030 to the US’s already massive greenhouse gas emissions tally.  All the while, the era of low interest rates that drove the massive expansion of both renewables and natural gas in the US in the past decade is ending just as the country needs a massive new buildout of energy production and infrastructure. Financing expenses are getting higher while permitting time and costs remain an obstacle, slowing down the shift to cleaner energy. So while the threats from climate change are more apparent than ever, it’s getting harder to wield the tools to keep it in check, and that means the fuels of the industrial revolution will continue to light the road ahead, for a while at least.

A new study reveals how the oil company used “cutting-edge propaganda” to focus on fossil fuel consumption. To understand why ExxonMobil has been so effective at shaping the US narrative about climate change in the US for some 40 years, look no further than the words of one of the company’s communications strategists, Mobil Vice President of Public Affairs Herbert Schmertz: ”Your objective is to wrap yourself in the good phrases while sticking your opponents with the bad ones,” he wrote in 1986.  From the 1970s through the 1990s, most of the company’s PR efforts focused on casting doubt on the scientific consensus that burning fossil fuels was warming the planet. But by the mid-2000s, it was taking a more sophisticated, nuanced approach. “Energy-saving consumers can make a real difference,” it said in 2007, listing ways consumers can “Be smart about electricity use,” “Heat and cool your home efficiently,” and “Improve your gas mileage” to address climate change. Another ad in 2008 looks to the auto industry: “It is important we reduce greenhouse gas emissions, too. Improving the efficiency of the vehicles people drive is one way to do so.” There are many examples in ExxonMobil’s advertising materials and other documents right up to 2019, all doing the same thing: Deflecting attention away from the oil company’s role in fueling climate change by supplying fossil fuels and turning attention toward consumer demand for, and dependency on, its products. We now have a comprehensive view of this strategy, thanks to a new peer-reviewed study by Harvard research associate Geoffrey Supran and Harvard science historian Naomi Oreskes in the journal One Earth. In a painstaking analysis, they show how hard the oil giant has worked to keep the conversation about climate solutions focused on the consumer, effectively individualizing responsibility for the problem. “Never before has it been proven that fossil fuel propaganda is demonstrably one source of where this [consumer- and demand-focused] mindset has originated from,” Supran told Vox. Blaming the individual user, rather than the producers, is a well-worn tactic of other industries with dangerous products, including tobacco and firearms. In the case of fossil fuel products, individualizing the responsibility for climate change obfuscates the responsibility of companies like Exxon — one of 20 companies responsible for one-third of energy-related global carbon emissions since 1965 — to extract fewer fossil fuels and shift to cleaner technologies. And according to Oreskes and Supran, not only has this messaging strategy allowed Exxon to “downplay its role in the climate crisis,” it also continues to be used “to undermine climate litigation, regulation, and activism.” Supran and Oreskes use a trove of documents that they have combed through in past research, namely a 2017 paper that found ExxonMobil internally acknowledging its products’ role in climate change, while publicly casting doubt on the science. Starting in the late 1970s, the company ran regular advertisements in the New York Times. The researchers looked at those ads as well as more recent reports aimed at investors through 2019 for a total of 212 documents that provide a solid chronology of how the oil company has communicated with the public on climate science. The early ads took a skeptical stance on climate science, but in the 2000s they started to emphasize the uncertainty of risks, rather than the consensus of manmade warming. When ExxonMobil did acknowledge the need to reduce pollution, it disproportionately talked about how much it was doing to address the demand-side of the equation, rather than addressing the obvious other half: the increasing supply. When Supran ran his algorithm to pick up the most frequently used terms and topics in the papers, he was surprised at what they found: The company’s messaging was largely consistent in the advertisements up to 2009 and in reports up to 2019, statistically overusing certain language, like “risk” and “demand,” to hammer home these themes. In 1997, the company touted helping “customers scale back their emissions of carbon dioxide,” while the next year it encouraged the public to “show a little voluntary ‘can do.’” A decade later, in 2008, an ad suggested the ‘‘cars and trucks we drive aren’t just vehicles, they’re opportunities to solve the world’s energy and environmental challenges.’’ Throughout this time, ExxonMobil discussed growing fossil fuel demand as an inevitability, saying things like, “Oil and gas will be essential to meeting demand through 2030” and “fossil fuels must be relied upon to meet society’s immediate and near-term needs.” The company only acknowledges its own culpability in obscure academic journals and internal memos. One 1982 internal memo writes what the company never admits publicly, that “the connection between Exxon’s major businesses and the role of fossil fuel combustion in contributing to the increase of atmospheric CO2.” The other trend the Harvard researchers note is how the company shifted to a “Fossil Fuel Savior” frame in the mid-2000s. A 2007 company ad notes the “increasing prosperity in the developing world [will be] the main driver of greater energy demand (and consequently rising CO2 emissions),” which positions the company as another passive bystander in global warming. Asked for comment on the study, Exxon spokesperson Casey Norton called it a conflict of interest, alleging that Oreskes is on retainer for Sher Edling, one of the law firms that has sued Exxon, and that the research was partially funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund, which is also involved in litigation against oil companies. “This research is clearly part of a litigation strategy against ExxonMobil and other energy companies,” Norton said. “ExxonMobil supports the Paris climate agreement, and is working to reduce company emissions and helping customers reduce their emissions while working on new lower-emission technologies and advocating for effective policies.” (Supran and Oreskes, in response, said Sher Edling “played no role in the paper we published today, nor in any other academic work we have done,” charging that ExxonMobil’s statement was purposely misleading.) Shaming individuals has pretty much always been a part of the climate discourse. Political leaders focus on recycling and consumption of plastics, rather than banning production, and now “flight shame” has taken off as a way to discourage plane travel to tackle the rising footprint of transportation emissions. But shame has a dark side: It can be a distraction that lets key perpetrators of climate change off the hook. Supran and Oreskes don’t have a precise measure of the impact ExxonMobil’s marketing has had on the public discourse — their methodology doesn’t go that far — but there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence that policymakers and the media overemphasize personal responsibility instead of systemic political and economic change. “At the grassroots level, people get accused of being hypocrites all the time,” for flying, driving, or using plastics, also derived from fossil fuels, Supran said. And research from Georgia State University shows how shame messaging can backfire: In a 2020 paper, they showed that in some cases, being told to drive less or change your diet can make people less willing to want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. ExxonMobil wasn’t the first oil company to push these narratives. “The very notion of a personal ‘carbon footprint,’ for example, was first popularized in 2004-2006 by oil firm BP as part of its $100+ million per year ‘beyond petroleum’ US media campaign,” Supran and Oreskes write. But ultimately these narratives “hamstring us, and they put blinders on us, to the systemic nature of the climate crisis and the importance of taking collective action to address the problem,” Supran said. It’s useful to have some statistical rigor backing up the observations of many academics, activists, and journalists, that by emphasizing demand, oil companies can play the part of innocent bystanders feeding a global hunger for their products. But the more consequential implications for this research may be in the courts. Major oil companies like ExxonMobil are currently facing an onslaught of lawsuits around the world charging that they have broken the law by pushing misinformation and thwarting climate action. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School counted 884 climate cases in 2017 had doubled to 1,550 cases by 2020 in 38 countries (Exxon is not the only subject of all these lawsuits). Just recently, New York City filed a new lawsuit against ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, and the American Petroleum Institute for violating the city’s consumer protection laws, another sign the wave of litigation is not slowing down. Supran and Oreskes’s study may be relevant to these lawsuits for a couple of reasons. First, the researchers note that ExxonMobil may be mounting a clever defense against these lawsuits with its greenwashing. One of its defenses actually cited the same logic that appears again and again in its advertising, that climate risks are common knowledge and the company bears no control over how people choose to live. Supran and Oreskes note the example: In 2018, arguing in defense of five oil companies (including ExxonMobil Corp) against a lawsuit brought by California cities seeking climate damages, Chevron lawyer Theodore Boutrous Jr. offered his interpretation of the IPCC’s latest report: ‘‘I think the IPCC does not say it’s the production and extraction of oil that is driving these emissions. It’s the energy use. It’s economic activity that creates demand for energy.’’ ‘‘It’s the way people are living their lives.’’ The judge’s dismissal of the case accepted this framing: ‘‘[W]ould it really be fair to now ignore our own responsibility in the use of fossil fuels and place the blame for global warming on those who supplied what we demanded?’’ Even if plaintiffs prove their case, fossil fuel companies can invoke ‘‘affirmative defenses’’—as tobacco companies often have—such as ‘‘common knowledge’’ and ‘‘assumption of the risk.’’ These respectively argue (1) ‘‘that the plaintiff had engaged in an activity [such as smoking] that involved obvious or widely known risks,’’ and (2) ‘‘that the plaintiff knew about and voluntarily undertook the risk.’’ As Brandt explains it, ‘‘If there was a risk, even though ‘unproven,’ it nonetheless must be the smoker’s risk, since the smoker had been fully informed of the ‘controversy.’ The industry had secured the best of both worlds.’’  The second implication is how their research can become a useful tool for climate activists and policymakers looking to hold ExxonMobil responsible. What Supran and Oreskes do in their paper, according to Carroll Muffett, president of the Center for International Environmental Law, is “prove quantitatively what has been qualitatively evident for years. ... Oil and gas companies insulated themselves from public scrutiny and regulatory action even as the climate crisis accelerated.” And any proof that oil companies were insulating themselves from climate policies while misleading the public is likely to become useful fodder in the courtroom. “This evidence will matter not only in the court of public opinion, but in courts of justice around the world faced with questions of industry accountability, culpability, and potential liability for mounting climate impacts,” Muffett said. The message Supran hopes people take from his work isn’t that your actions don’t matter. But governments need to take responsibility and hold the major polluters accountable — and those policies include a broader mix of solutions that limit the fuels Exxon can extract, axing pipeline projects for transportation, limiting its opportunity to export around the world, and even make companies pay for the damages caused to vulnerable communities. “This is cutting-edge propaganda coming from an industry with 100 years of experience in pioneering the art of public relations,” he said. “And people should be aware of what they’re subject to, because otherwise it gets into our bones without us even knowing where it came from.” Update, May 13, 5:54 pm: The story has been updated to include comment from ExxonMobil spokesperson Casey Norton, and Supran’s response to it.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? The fossil fuel industry’s carbon capture bamboozle, explained. This spring, Democrats wrapped up a nearly three-year investigation into the fossil fuel industry’s role in climate disinformation, and asked the Department of Justice to pick up where they left off. In House and Senate Democrats’ final report and hearing, investigators concluded that major oil companies had not only misled the public on climate change for decades, but also were continuing to misinform them about the industry’s preferred climate “solutions”— particularly biofuels and carbon capture.  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who spearheaded the investigation, also accused oil companies of “obstructing” the investigation, submitting few documents, and redacting much of what they did send. One ExxonMobil employee who spoke with Drilled and Vox under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described what the company sent as “a truly random assortment of unimportant documents.”  But there was at least one notable exception in the form of a report detailing the company’s projections for the future of carbon capture technology.  If you’ve read the New York Times recently, or seen this ad on Politico’s website or heard it on one of its podcasts, or listened to the Planet Money podcast, you may have noticed the industry’s relentlessly positive marketing of carbon capture, which aims to collect and store CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial and fossil fuel extraction facilities, so they don’t add to global warming. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said carbon capture might be necessary to reduce the emissions of certain “hard to abate” sectors like steel, concrete, and some chemical manufacturing, but noted that in the best-case scenario, with carbon capture technology working flawlessly and deployed at large scale, it could only account for a little over 2 percent of global carbon emissions reductions by 2030. That hasn’t stopped major oil companies from claiming that carbon capture and storage “will be essential for helping society achieve net-zero emissions,” that they are delivering “carbon capture for American industry,” working on reducing emissions in their own businesses (also referred to as “carbon intensity”), and delivering “heavy industry with low emissions.” But internal documents obtained during the federal investigation, as well as information that industry whistleblowers shared with Drilled and Vox, reveal an industry that is decidedly more realistic about the emissions-reduction potential of carbon capture and storage technology, or CCS, than it presents publicly.  In 2018, the oil and gas company Shell released an updated energy scenario, a forecast that served as a standard for the rest of the oil industry, in which it laid out what the Washington Post called a “radical” new approach on climate. Beginning in 1965, Shell pioneered the now-common practice of “scenario planning” for oil companies: mapping out what the industry and the world are likely to look like in the future; other oil companies will still often compare their scenarios to Shell’s.  Exxon’s own internal 2018 scenario comparison was included in the most recent batch of documents handed over to Senate and House investigators. In it, ExxonMobil compared its future projections with Shell’s rosiest forecast for the energy transition. Buried in a chart in that projection is ExxonMobil’s belief about the global potential for CCS.  Even without the massive stamp on this page marking it as part of a set of documents obtained by congressional subpoena, these graphs would be difficult to read. The one above compares the projected number of CCS units in Shell’s scenario versus the number projected by ExxonMobil, while the graph on the right compares the two companies’ forecasts for future CO2 emissions.  While Shell’s optimistic projection envisions 10,000 large-scale CCS facilities operational by 2070, with more than 2,500 facilities by 2050, Exxon predicts somewhere between 250 and 500 facilities by 2050. Elsewhere in the scenario, Exxon also envisions that “global scale is limited” for CCS and hydrogen tech by 2050.  Exxon’s past projections were much more in line with what critics of CCS have been saying for years. The IPCC, for example, has said that even if realized at its full announced potential, CCS would only account for about 2.4 percent of the world’s carbon mitigation by 2030. In its fact sheet on CCS, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Ohio that produces market-based research on the energy transition, states: “It’s worth noting that not one single CCS project has ever reached its target CO2 capture rate.”  Stanford University researcher Mark Jacobson said that because it also requires energy and materials to function, CCS attached to a fossil-fueled power plant is still worse for the climate than replacing fossil energy with renewables. “They actually increase carbon dioxide emissions by doing this, in addition to increasing air pollution,” he said, referencing a study he conducted in 2019 quantifying the lifecycle CO2 emissions of various carbon capture scenarios. Even when CCS is powered by wind, Jacobson said it’s not worth doing, from a climate perspective. “If you just used wind to replace coal in the first place, you’d get a higher reduction in CO2 emissions,” he said.  And oil giants themselves have been hedging on the technology for years, despite marketing its potential. When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed requiring that power plants install CCS in its rules for power plants, for example, both fossil fuel companies and utilities expressed far less faith in the technology in their public comments on the rule than they have in their ads about carbon capture. In Exxon’s public comment, the company encouraged the agency to reduce its requirements around capture efficiency from 95 percent to 75 percent, which is more in line with the actual performance of existing CCS projects.  “Last year, when the first EPA power plant rule was released, it was going to mandate either using CCS on a power plant in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to take some action that would be equivalent to adding CCS, and the response from industry was ‘Hey, the tech is really not proven,’” said David Schlissel, director of resource planning analysis for IEEFA. “Many, many comments from oil companies and utilities, in response to both the initial EPA rule and the current one, were saying this tech really doesn’t work.” Exxon’s low internal projections for CCS back in 2018 map to the company’s own experience with the technology, too. To date, the only “successful” carbon capture project Exxon points to in its materials is its LaBarge Shute Creek gas facility in Wyoming. The Shute Creek facility is often referenced by the industry in general as a successful large and longstanding CCS project. On paper, LaBarge is responsible for around 40 percent of the total carbon emissions ever captured in the world. But the details tell a different story.  According to Exxon’s own disclosures and an analysis conducted by IEEFA in 2022, only around 3 percent of the carbon captured there (roughly 6 million tonnes) has been permanently sequestered underground. Of the rest of the 240 million tonnes of carbon emitted over the facility’s first 35 years in operation, half has been sold to various oilfield operators for enhanced oil recovery, or EOR — a process by which oil companies inject carbon underground to get more oil out — and approximately 120 million tonnes has been vented into the atmosphere. When asked to comment for this story about its 2018 scenario plan and overall record on CCS, ExxonMobil sent the following statement by email: “False narratives that downplay our CCS efforts deliberately fail to recognize the strides we’re making in our Low Carbon Solutions business. Referencing one possible scenario from over six years ago does not represent our business outlook. We continuously evaluate our business plan based on market conditions.” Exxon pointed to its public-facing 2023 Global Outlook as its most current thinking on the potential of carbon capture. That report states: “Carbon capture and storage is a proven and safe technology that reduces emissions from manufacturing and power generation.” But in commenting on its scenario plan, Exxon’s spokesperson spoke only to “market conditions” and its shifting “business outlook,” not to the technology itself. The business outlook and market conditions for CCS have changed because of an increased tax credit for CCS that oil companies, including Exxon, lobbied for — and, according to the documents subpoenaed by federal investigators, heavily influenced — and that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced in 2021 as part of the negotiations that saw the Biden administration’s proposed “Build Back Better” legislation morph into the Inflation Reduction Act. That’s thanks to major changes to the CCS tax credit known as 45Q, which started out in 2008 paying $10 for every metric ton of carbon sequestered and now pays as much as $85 per metric ton, and up to $60 per ton stored and then used for EOR. Suddenly, EOR is CCS and CCS is profitable.  “There is no cap on 45Q and stored emissions are entirely self-reported,” Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of the Science and Environmental Health Network, said.  The credit nominally requires companies to verify their claims, but aside from some specific requirements to ensure condensed CO2 doesn’t wind up in groundwater, the EPA is not verifying how much carbon is actually sequestered by these projects.  When asked about verification of carbon stored under the 45Q tax credit, the EPA told Drilled and Vox that it “does not implement the Section 45Q tax credit program and is not privy to taxpayer data,” and that questions about how tax claims are verified should be directed to the IRS. The IRS confirmed that it ensures companies claiming the credit have filed paperwork outlining their claims, including a lifecycle analysis, but that it does not have the scientific or technical expertise to verify that the amount of carbon claimed is actually being permanently sequestered. “What the IPCC actually said in its mitigation report was that carbon capture might be necessary for hard-to-abate industries, but that it’s one of the most expensive options and it only equates to small emissions reductions,” said Paul Blackburn, an environmental lawyer and advisor to the Bold Alliance, a nonprofit network of frontline communities focused on protecting land and water. “So we’re doing the most expensive, least applicable thing first rather than cheapest, easiest things first, at great expense to taxpayers and with no analysis of net climate benefit.” But even before the creation of a remarkably generous tax credit, and despite their own internal projections or challenges with the technology, major oil companies painted a rosy picture of CCS. Emails obtained by federal investigators show that Shell pulled together an “Alliance of Champions” to promote CCS, and BP worked with the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative to develop what it called “CCS enabling narratives,” while Exxon began promoting itself as a leader in carbon capture.  In the last five years, Exxon has produced multiple pro-CCS brochures and ads, comparing the carbon capture potential at industrial plants to the carbon sequestration of actual plants and trees. An NPR sponsorship from 2018, for example, describes ExxonMobil as “the company that believes that carbon capture technologies are critical for lowering global CO2 emissions.”  The company even worked on a series of kids’ videos touting CCS. In one subpoenaed email, Exxon executives asked the creative team working on the kids’ series to steer away from the idea that carbon is bad or that carbon capture is difficult. “De-emphasize concept that catching carbon is difficult or hard,” the feedback reads.  Yet that is precisely the company’s experience with CCS, according to several current and former Exxon staffers who agreed to speak with Drilled and Vox on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Some of them were involved in the early days of researching CCS as a potential climate solution at Exxon, which they said only began in earnest in 2018, the same year that the 45Q tax credit first increased (from $10 for every metric ton of sequestered carbon to about $50 per metric ton).  The company’s experience before then, the sources said, was entirely focused on enhanced oil recovery — the process of injecting CO2 into a separate well to increase enough pressure in a reservoir to push additional oil out of a production well. While enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, does sequester carbon — some of it stays underground after it’s been injected — experts say the process could release 40 percent of the CO2 back into the air, and the oil it helps to get out of the ground also generates CO2 emissions when it’s burned. Exxon is not the only one that embraced EOR for years before repositioning it as a climate solution. The industry has known for decades that compressed carbon works really well to vacuum up any remaining oil from porous rock, but it’s expensive to store and transport carbon. The industry’s embrace of natural gas helped drive down costs a bit, because while the finished product might be “low carbon,” gas often comes out of the ground bringing quite a bit of CO2 with it. That CO2 needs to be stripped out to make natural gas, a process called “gas sweetening,” leaving companies with excess CO2.  Still, the process of storing and transporting it remained expensive, so it didn’t always make financial sense to do EOR. Now, with investor-owned oil companies like Exxon, Chevron, BP, and Shell hurtling toward an inevitable decline in production rates — an inflection point referred to as “peak oil” — they need EOR more than ever. By rebranding it as a climate solution and tying it to a tax credit, they’ve not just made the process cheaper, they’ve created a new revenue stream — called Low Carbon Solutions at Exxon and Shell, Gas & Low Carbon Energy at BP, and Lower Carbon at Chevron.  The 45Q tax credit revenue will also make it feasible for these new business units to supply carbon capture where it might genuinely be needed, on facilities with hard-to-abate emissions, like concrete, steel, and ammonia plants. But the vast majority of carbon that US taxpayers are paying oil companies to capture will either be going toward generating more oil, or would have greater emissions reductions benefits had the companies opted not to drill for gas in the first place. The above emails, showing ExxonMobil employees’ conversations about marketing carbon capture and storage to an audience of children and Gen Z consumers, were originally obtained by congressional subpoena to a House committee and have been reproduced here by Drilled and Vox. According to the International Energy Agency, using “naturally occurring” carbon — the CO2 that comes up with methane as part of natural gas, for example — for EOR as opposed to “anthropogenic CO2,” the emissions captured from a facility like a power plant or factory, “clearly provides no benefit in terms of emissions intensity.” That’s because absent the drilling in the first place, there would be no CO2 or methane emissions in those cases. In the United States, more than 70 percent of the CO2 injected underground as part of the EOR process is from natural sources. That’s true of Exxon’s showcase facility — the Shute Creek facility in LaBarge, Wyoming — as well. The CO2 source there is the gas that’s being drilled. ExxonMobil calls this “anthropogenic CO2,” but when pressed, a spokesperson told Drilled it’s generated by the separation process, or gas sweetening. In other words, absent the gas drilling, there would be no CO2 emissions at the site in the first place. Despite that, when ExxonMobil talks about itself as the “global leader” in CCS, pointing to its “more than 30 years capturing and storing carbon dioxide,” and the fact that it has captured more CO2 than any other company in the world, it is referring to LaBarge, which has been in operation since 1986.  According to a case study from MIT, where Exxon has long funded research on CCS and other industry-friendly “climate solutions,” from 1986 to 2008, LaBarge reinjected about 400,000 tonnes of CO2 a year back into the reservoir from which it came, and vented 180 million cubic feet of CO2 per day from the facility’s smokestacks. In 2008, it was ordered by Wyoming’s Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to reduce its vented CO2 emissions, which it did by building out a carbon capture system that redirected CO2 into pipelines for enhanced oil recovery.  In 2022, a study from IEEFA found that LaBarge was selling half of its captured carbon for enhanced oil recovery and venting the rest. This means that millions of tonnes of carbon the company claimed to have “captured” were ultimately emitted. Climate scientists say CCS connected to fossil fuel use or production delivers little benefit when it comes to tackling climate change, period.  “It doesn’t make sense to use CCS to prolong our use of fossil fuels, especially to produce electricity,” said David Ho, professor at University of Hawaii and senior researcher at Columbia University. “The argument in favor of enhanced oil recovery is often that if they weren’t using this captured CO2, they’d be using some other CO2, but I don’t think you can call anything where you’re getting more oil out of the ground to burn a climate solution.”  Yet, so far, major oil companies have struggled to deploy CCS technology in any other capacity. “When we talk about the failure of CCS, we generally talk about capturing, not storage, but when you look at capacity and how much has actually been sequestered, it’s very little,” Ho said.  When CO2 is actually sequestered underground, there’s no guarantee it stays there. “CO2 has a way of moving through the air, of leaking through pipelines, and because we have no cradle-to-grave tracking, we have no way of actually knowing how much is leaking, how much is really being collected, how much is hitting the wellhead, and how much is really staying underground,” Raffensperger said. That’s not just concerning from a climate perspective, but from a public health perspective as well. Raffensperger notes that the pipelines built to transport condensed carbon from oil fields to storage facilities, or to other oil fields for EOR, are surrounded by “kill zones.”  “These are not your grandmother’s pipelines,” Raffensperger said. “They could be lethal. We talk about the kill zone or a fatality zone around a CO2 pipeline. We don’t talk about that with oil and gas pipelines. These are uniquely dangerous and underregulated.” Following a 2020 CO2 leak and explosion in Satartia, Mississippi, that abruptly stopped cars on roadways, caused widespread dizziness and nausea, and sent several residents to the hospital, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration began looking into rules for CO2 pipelines. They were set to finalize that rule this summer, pending review by the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, but that deadline has been extended to fall 2024. The lack of finalized safety regulations has not stopped the permitting of CO2 pipelines, though. The Summit pipeline, a massive project that would carry carbon across five states, just got the go-ahead in June for the first step of its construction process in Iowa: seizing land through eminent domain to make way for the pipeline.  According to current and former Exxon employees, the company’s efforts to explore the “S” part of the CCS equation — storage, or sequestration — only began when it pulled together a team of technical experts to look for weaknesses in a 2018 US Geological Survey assessment that showed enormous potential for CCS.  “They thought the USGS was overly optimistic [about the potential of CCS] and they wanted us to basically bring industry technical expertise in to tell them their projections were overblown,” one Exxon staffer said. The team brought together to study CCS was then tasked with running an experiment to see if it was even possible to permanently store captured carbon. When the study showed that it was indeed possible, current and former Exxon staffers told Vox and Drilled the company’s executives were “surprised.” To truly sell CCS as a climate solution, Exxon had to show that storage at scale was feasible. Former employees told us that at the end of the last decade, executives came up with a prioritized list of the company’s export and import terminals and refineries where it might be relatively easy to attach CCS. As of this year, none of those projects have been built (though the company did publicly announce in late 2023 that it was working on a fuel-cell-powered carbon capture and hydrogen project at its Rotterdam refinery, one of the options on that list).  While it hasn’t managed to build commercial-scale carbon storage itself, Exxon did acquire enhanced oil recovery company Denbury in 2023, which brought 1,300 miles of CO2 pipelines and 15 onshore carbon storage sites under Exxon’s control. Again, this system is focused on enhanced oil recovery.  “CCS is a proven and safe technology that experts agree is pivotal to achieving net zero,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said in response to a request for comment for this story. “We’re making progress in our Low Carbon Solutions business, with current plans to capture and permanently store more CO2 than any other company.” Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has called the industry’s plan to offset its emissions with carbon capture “fantasy.”  But the US government is all in on that fantasy now. “[The carbon capture tax credit] 45Q is not based on net climate benefit or net CO2 reductions, it’s based on gross CO2 capture,” Blackburn, the environmental lawyer, said. “Why would you think making carbon a commodity would reduce CO2 emissions? It’s like the opposite of carbon tax, we’re actually paying them to produce more of it.” Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe fossil fuel industry’s carbon capture bamboozle, explained.\n\nThis spring, Democrats wrapped up a nearly three-year investigation into the fossil fuel industry’s role in climate disinformation, and asked the Department of Justice to pick up where they left off. In House and Senate Democrats’ final report and hearing, investigators concluded that major oil companies had not only misled the public on climate change for decades, but also were continuing to misinform them about the industry’s preferred climate “solutions”— particularly biofuels and carbon capture.\n\nSen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD), who spearheaded the investigation, also accused oil companies of “obstructing” the investigation, submitting few documents, and redacting much of what they did send. One ExxonMobil employee who spoke with Drilled and Vox under condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation described what the company sent as “a truly random assortment of unimportant documents.” \n\nBut there was at least one notable exception in the form of a report detailing the company’s projections for the future of carbon capture technology.\n\nIf you’ve read the New York Times recently, or seen this ad on Politico’s website or heard it on one of its podcasts, or listened to the Planet Money podcast, you may have noticed the industry’s relentlessly positive marketing of carbon capture, which aims to collect and store CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial and fossil fuel extraction facilities, so they don’t add to global warming.\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said carbon capture might be necessary to reduce the emissions of certain “hard to abate” sectors like steel, concrete, and some chemical manufacturing, but noted that in the best-case scenario, with carbon capture technology working flawlessly and deployed at large scale, it could only account for a little over 2 percent of global carbon emissions reductions by 2030.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped major oil companies from claiming that carbon capture and storage “will be essential for helping society achieve net-zero emissions,” that they are delivering “carbon capture for American industry,” working on reducing emissions in their own businesses (also referred to as “carbon intensity”), and delivering “heavy industry with low emissions.”\n\nBut internal documents obtained during the federal investigation, as well as information that industry whistleblowers shared with Drilled and Vox, reveal an industry that is decidedly more realistic about the emissions-reduction potential of carbon capture and storage technology, or CCS, than it presents publicly.\n\nIn 2018, the oil and gas company Shell released an updated energy scenario, a forecast that served as a standard for the rest of the oil industry, in which it laid out what the Washington Post called a “radical” new approach on climate. Beginning in 1965, Shell pioneered the now-common practice of “scenario planning” for oil companies: mapping out what the industry and the world are likely to look like in the future; other oil companies will still often compare their scenarios to Shell’s.\n\nExxon’s own internal 2018 scenario comparison was included in the most recent batch of documents handed over to Senate and House investigators. In it, ExxonMobil compared its future projections with Shell’s rosiest forecast for the energy transition. Buried in a chart in that projection is ExxonMobil’s belief about the global potential for CCS.\n\nWhile Shell’s optimistic projection envisions 10,000 large-scale CCS facilities operational by 2070, with more than 2,500 facilities by 2050, Exxon predicts somewhere between 250 and 500 facilities by 2050. Elsewhere in the scenario, Exxon also envisions that “global scale is limited” for CCS and hydrogen tech by 2050.\n\nExxon’s past projections were much more in line with what critics of CCS have been saying for years. The IPCC, for example, has said that even if realized at its full announced potential, CCS would only account for about 2.4 percent of the world’s carbon mitigation by 2030.\n\nIn its fact sheet on CCS, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank in Ohio that produces market-based research on the energy transition, states: “It’s worth noting that not one single CCS project has ever reached its target CO2 capture rate.”\n\nStanford University researcher Mark Jacobson said that because it also requires energy and materials to function, CCS attached to a fossil-fueled power plant is still worse for the climate than replacing fossil energy with renewables. “They actually increase carbon dioxide emissions by doing this, in addition to increasing air pollution,” he said, referencing a study he conducted in 2019 quantifying the lifecycle CO2 emissions of various carbon capture scenarios.\n\nEven when CCS is powered by wind, Jacobson said it’s not worth doing, from a climate perspective. “If you just used wind to replace coal in the first place, you’d get a higher reduction in CO2 emissions,” he said.\n\nAnd oil giants themselves have been hedging on the technology for years, despite marketing its potential. When the Environmental Protection Agency proposed requiring that power plants install CCS in its rules for power plants, for example, both fossil fuel companies and utilities expressed far less faith in the technology in their public comments on the rule than they have in their ads about carbon capture.\n\nIn Exxon’s public comment, the company encouraged the agency to reduce its requirements around capture efficiency from 95 percent to 75 percent, which is more in line with the actual performance of existing CCS projects.\n\n“Last year, when the first EPA power plant rule was released, it was going to mandate either using CCS on a power plant in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to take some action that would be equivalent to adding CCS, and the response from industry was ‘Hey, the tech is really not proven,’” said David Schlissel, director of resource planning analysis for IEEFA.\n\nExxon’s low internal projections for CCS back in 2018 map to the company’s own experience with the technology, too. To date, the only “successful” carbon capture project Exxon points to in its materials is its LaBarge Shute Creek gas facility in Wyoming.\n\nThe Shute Creek facility is often referenced by the industry in general as a successful large and longstanding CCS project. On paper, LaBarge is responsible for around 40 percent of the total carbon emissions ever captured in the world.\n\nBut the details tell a different story.\n\nAccording to Exxon’s own disclosures and an analysis conducted by IEEFA in 2022, only around 3 percent of the carbon captured there (roughly 6 million tonnes) has been permanently sequestered underground. Of the rest of the 240 million tonnes of carbon emitted over the facility’s first 35 years in operation, half has been sold to various oilfield operators for enhanced oil recovery, or EOR — a process by which oil companies inject carbon underground to get more oil out — and approximately 120 million tonnes has been vented into the atmosphere.\n\nWhen asked to comment for this story about its 2018 scenario plan and overall record on CCS, ExxonMobil sent the following statement by email: “False narratives that downplay our CCS efforts deliberately fail to recognize the strides we’re making in our Low Carbon Solutions business. Referencing one possible scenario from over six years ago does not represent our business outlook. We continuously evaluate our business plan based on market conditions.”\n\nExxon pointed to its public-facing 2023 Global Outlook as its most current thinking on the potential of carbon capture. That report states: “Carbon capture and storage is a proven and safe technology that reduces emissions from manufacturing and power generation.”\n\nBut in commenting on its scenario plan, Exxon’s spokesperson spoke only to “market conditions” and its shifting “business outlook,” not to the technology itself.\n\nThe business outlook and market conditions for CCS have changed because of an increased tax credit for CCS that oil companies, including Exxon, lobbied for — and, according to the documents subpoenaed by federal investigators, heavily influenced — and that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced in 2021 as part of the negotiations that saw the Biden administration’s proposed “Build Back Better” legislation morph into the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThat’s thanks to major changes to the CCS tax credit known as 45Q, which started out in 2008 paying $10 for every metric ton of carbon sequestered and now pays as much as $85 per metric ton, and up to $60 per ton stored and then used for EOR.\n\nSuddenly, EOR is CCS and CCS is profitable.\n\n“There is no cap on 45Q and stored emissions are entirely self-reported,” Carolyn Raffensperger, executive director of

confirmed that it ensures companies claiming the credit have filed paperwork outlining their claims, including a lifecycle analysis, but that it does not have the scientific or technical expertise to

hard-to-abate industries, but that it’s one of the most expensive options and it only equates to small emissions reductions,” said Paul Blackburn, an environmental lawyer and advisor to the Bold

in Iowa: seizing land through eminent domain to make way for the pipeline.\n\nAccording to current and former Exxon employees, the company’s efforts to explore the “S” part of the CCS equation — storage, or sequestration — only began when it pulled together a team of technical experts to look for weaknesses in a 2018 US Geological Survey assessment that showed enormous potential for CCS.\n\n“They thought the USGS was overly optimistic [about the potential of CCS] and they wanted us to basically bring industry technical expertise in to tell them their projections were overblown,” one Exxon staffer said.\n\nThe team brought together to study CCS was then tasked with running an experiment to see if it was even possible to permanently store captured carbon.\n\nWhen the study showed that it was indeed possible, current and former Exxon staffers told Vox and Drilled the company’s executives were “surprised.”\n\nTo truly sell CCS as a climate solution, Exxon had to show that storage at scale was feasible.\n\nFormer employees told us that at the end of the last decade, executives came up with a prioritized list of the company’s export and import terminals and refineries where it might be relatively easy to attach CCS.\n\nAs of this year, none of those projects have been built (though the company did publicly announce in late 2023 that it was working on a fuel-cell-powered carbon capture and hydrogen project at its Rotterdam refinery, one of the options on that list).\n\nWhile it hasn’t managed to build commercial-scale carbon storage itself, Exxon did acquire enhanced oil recovery company Denbury in 2023, which brought 1,300 miles of CO2 pipelines and 15 onshore carbon storage sites under Exxon’s control.\n\nAgain, this system is focused on enhanced oil recovery.\n\n“CCS is a proven and safe technology that experts agree is pivotal to achieving net zero,” an ExxonMobil spokesperson said in response to a request for comment for this story.\n\n“We’re making progress in our Low Carbon Solutions business, with current plans to capture and permanently store more CO2 than any other company.”\n\nFatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, has called the industry’s plan to offset its emissions with carbon capture “fantasy.”\n\nBut the US government is all in on that fantasy now.\n\n“[The carbon capture tax credit] 45Q is not based on net climate benefit or net CO2 reductions, it’s based on gross CO2 capture,” Blackburn, the environmental lawyer, said.\n\n“Why would you think making carbon a commodity would reduce CO2 emissions?\n\nIt’s like the opposite of carbon tax, we’re actually paying them to produce more of it.”",

        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we’re committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it’s hard. That kind of journalism isn’t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Automakers, industries, and governments are betting on hydrogen again. Will it work this time? This story is part of Recode by Vox’s Tech Support series, which explores solutions for our warming world. Between the battery electrics, plug-in hybrids, and radar-festooned self-driving cars on the streets here in San Francisco, the slick red Toyota Mirai doesn’t turn many heads.  That’s despite it being one of the most technologically advanced cars in the world and one of the rarest. Since it went on sale in 2015, Toyota has sold only about 10,000 of the sedans in the United States (out of a total of approximately 290 million registered cars in the country). Yet it easily blends in with traffic. The Mirai takes styling cues from Toyota’s more mundane offerings, like the Corolla and the Camry. Inside the cabin, it has the fit, finish, noise isolation, and heated seats of a luxury car. Behind the wheel, the Mirai has the torquey pull of an electric motor, launching up steep streets and feeling far more nimble than its 4,200-pound weight would suggest. It’s only when you pop the hood that you can see what sets the Mirai apart: a tidy silver block with the Toyota logo and the words “fuel cell.” And behind the back seat is a tank filled with hydrogen gas — the most abundant element in the universe, and potentially a clean fuel whose main “waste” product is water. The world is desperate for more ways to curb carbon dioxide pollution. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global greenhouse gas emissions have to peak and decline by 2025 to keep warming this century below 1.5 degrees Celsius. That’s less than 1,000 days away, yet global emissions are still rising. And transportation alone accounts for 20 percent of global emissions. That’s where hydrogen energy comes in — companies like Toyota think it could be the future, or at least a part of it (“Mirai” means “future” in Japanese). While other clean energy technologies like battery-powered vehicles have gained momentum, they aren’t rolling out fast enough or cheap enough. Hydrogen could help get the world to its climate goals faster by powering not only cars like the Mirai, but also ships and aircraft in the near future.  Hydrogen has potential uses beyond vehicles, too: It can make synthetic fuels and store power for the electricity grid; it can also clean up industries that are notoriously hard to decarbonize, like steel manufacturing.  Hydrogen fuel cells have dropped 60 percent in price since 2006, while their durability increased fourfold These promising use cases have driven interest and investment in hydrogen as fuel in the past, which is why you may have heard about it before: Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama touted hydrogen and invested government money into researching and developing the fuel. But the hype faded each time as high production costs, practical challenges, and a limited infrastructure for hydrogen-powered vehicles got in the way. For hydrogen-powered cars to truly take off anywhere, they’ll first require a vast network of fueling stations, pipelines, and producers — essentially a hydrogen economy — to compete and win against fossil fuels. The US has never gotten close to building something like this. But for now, the momentum behind hydrogen energy is once again building as its demand grows and the technology behind it improves. According to 2018 data, hydrogen fuel cells have dropped 60 percent in price since 2006, while their durability increased fourfold.  In 2021, Toyota sold more than 2,600 Mirais in the US, a record. Other hydrogen cars have entered the market too, including the Hyundai Nexo and the Honda Clarity. As of March 1, more than 12,000 hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have been sold or leased in the US. Meanwhile, Delta Airlines and Airbus in March signed an agreement to develop hydrogen-powered aircraft. New hydrogen production plants are in the works in the US. In February, President Joe Biden announced close to $10 billion in funding to boost hydrogen production, infrastructure, and research.  Overseas, China announced plans to produce as much as 200,000 tons of carbon-free hydrogen per year to help run a fleet of 50,000 fuel cell-powered vehicles by 2025. The United Kingdom is aiming to double its hydrogen production. Globally, hydrogen production and transportation has received more than $80 billion in investment.  In a moment when the urgency of the climate crisis cannot be understated, hydrogen is getting another chance to help clean up the planet.  Like many clean technologies, hydrogen has tricky nuances, especially when it comes to its “clean” credentials. For one thing, many researchers and engineers would argue that hydrogen is not an energy source; it’s an energy carrier. It’s analogous to a battery, which can hold energy but still needs another way to charge it. While hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, it’s usually attached to other molecules here on earth. To use it as a fuel, you must first form hydrogen gas, H2 (two hydrogen atoms stuck together), which requires a source of hydrogen atoms and an energy input. Hydrogen gas is more of a middleman between an energy source and its use in a car, boat, or power plant. It often takes more energy to make H2 than you get from using it, similar to how a battery requires a bit more energy to charge up than it releases in use. According to the International Energy Agency, hydrogen production accounts for 830 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year, equivalent to the footprint of the United Kingdom and Indonesia combined. Hydrogen itself is an odorless, colorless gas no matter how it’s produced, but the various ways to make hydrogen are typically categorized by color. The main types of hydrogen to pay attention to are gray hydrogen and green hydrogen.  In the US, 95 percent of hydrogen is gray hydrogen, which is made with steam-methane reforming. The process uses steam as hot as 1,800°F to react with methane under high pressure, yielding hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. It’s cheap, but it has a carbon footprint: Every kilogram of gray hydrogen results in about 10 kilograms of carbon dioxide. Green hydrogen, on the other hand, draws on renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, a process called electrolysis. It produces zero carbon dioxide emissions, but it’s upward of twice as expensive to produce as gray hydrogen and it accounts for less than 1 percent of the world’s hydrogen production. There are other colors too — blue, pink, turquoise, black, white — distinguished by where the hydrogen comes from and how much carbon dioxide the process emits.  For hydrogen to truly help with confronting the climate crisis, the world must figure out how to produce cleaner hydrogen at larger scales and lower cost. Last year, the US Department of Energy launched a research program called Hydrogen Shot with the aim of making clean hydrogen for $1 per kilogram in 10 years.  As for using hydrogen, there are two main ways to put it to work. One is to burn it like any other gas in engines, similar to conventional internal combustion engines that run on fuels like gasoline and diesel. Unlike those fuels, hydrogen doesn’t release harmful emissions when you burn it. The other way is to send hydrogen through a fuel cell. This device separates hydrogen into protons and electrons, with the electrons generating a current to power a motor and the protons reacting with oxygen in the air to make water. Fuel cells actually have a long history dating back to the 1800s. But only in recent years did their cost, efficiency, and durability reach the levels needed for more widespread use.  With both fuel cells and combustion, hydrogen’s uses can scale from small unmanned aircraft to storing and dispatching electricity on the power grid. Its potential to reduce emissions is very real — but a lot has to fall into place first. The ins and outs of owning a hydrogen-powered car illustrate the fuel’s promise, but also the immense hurdles it will have to overcome in order to take a bite of greenhouse gas emissions and anchor a new clean industry. There are big advantages to a hydrogen car: It can refuel in five minutes, compared to sometimes hours of charging needed for a battery electric car. You also don’t need access to a car charger, but rather a pump similar to one used for gasoline, often at the same station. That’s one reason that motivated Darren Higuchi of Alameda, California, to buy a Mirai last year. Since he lives in a multifamily building, Higuchi said he doesn’t have the option to install a car charger at home. “I see people lining up for [the Tesla supercharger nearby], parking and waiting, and that’s more maintenance than I want to deal with,” he said.  Hydrogen fuel cell cars have the same smooth and quiet electric drivetrain as battery-powered cars, which also brings lower maintenance costs compared to gasoline and diesel engines. Drivers can use carpool lanes in most states as well. There are financial incentives, too: Mirais come with a factory rebate, a federal tax credit, and California’s clean vehicle credit, which drops its out-the-door price from around $60,000 to $35,000. Toyota also gives owners $15,000 worth of hydrogen fuel for free. Out of pocket, filling up a Mirai costs between $70 to $100 and provides close to 400 miles of range.  But for all the work Toyota put into making an appealing hydrogen car, its biggest drawbacks are beyond the company’s control. Most of the hydrogen fueling stations in the US are in California. The state has 52 hydrogen stations, including two in San Francisco, and 121 in development, according to the California Fuel Cell Partnership. But the stations are mainly concentrated around the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California. There’s just one hydrogen station on the 340-mile I-5 stretch between the Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles. On a road trip to San Diego in his Mirai, Higuchi said he gamed out the locations of hydrogen fueling stations, how fast he wanted to drive, and how much we wanted to test the range of the car. “I mapped out where I would go and paired that to anxiety levels,” he said.  Right now, hydrogen infrastructure is caught in a rut. With so few hydrogen cars on the road, it’s hard to convince companies to invest the approximately $2 million it typically costs to build a single hydrogen station. But with so few stations, it’s tough to sell drivers on a hydrogen car. The small scales of hydrogen production have also left it vulnerable to shocks. Right now, most hydrogen produced in the US is used for chemical manufacturing. “We’ve been living off of surplus hydrogen that is being taken from other industries and being used for transportation,” said Russ Mobley, a sales manager at San Francisco Toyota and a Mirai owner. In 2019, a hydrogen explosion at a Santa Clara plant caused shortages across the Bay Area for nearly six months. During that time, Toyota gave Mirai drivers free rental cars to get around. “We didn’t drive our hydrogen cars. They became paperweights at that point in our driveways,” Mobley said.  Compare these ordeals to battery-electric cars, which can charge up just about anywhere there is a power outlet or at one of the fast-charging stations cropping up quickly around the country. So while hydrogen cars themselves may be excellent, the weak infrastructure to support them continues to hold them back. The infrastructure hydrogen needs poses its own technical challenges. It requires high-pressure pumps, fittings, and storage containers, many of which are expensive boutique products. The Covid-19 pandemic then threw up another roadblock, disrupting the supply chains for hydrogen construction projects.  “These pumps are all handmade,” Mobley said. “When the entire world shuts down and nobody’s in there manufacturing the bolts and nuts and seals, pretty much we saw the construction halt.” The hope now is that with larger players like trucking and delivery companies investing in their own hydrogen vehicles, they will drive economies of scale for everyone. With larger vehicles, planned routes, and centralized fueling, these industrial uses might be even a better use for hydrogen than passenger cars. “As we rotate into more of the trucking industry getting into using hydrogen technology, the infrastructure is going to be beefed up considerably,” Mobley said. Daimler Truck, for example, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles, accounting for about 58 percent of the market for large highway trucks. The company has already received approval for a hydrogen-powered truck in Germany and expects to begin delivering hydrogen trucks to customers in 2027. It’s also a shareholder in H2 Mobility Deutschland, a hydrogen fueling station operator that recently raised 110 million euros from investors. In addition, Daimler has teamed up with Volvo to build a fuel cell factory scheduled to begin operation in 2025.  Meanwhile, delivery firms like DHL, Royal Mail, FedEx, UPS, and Swiss Post are currently testing out hydrogen vehicles on their routes.  As for industrial uses, Swedish steel manufacturer Hybrit last year began delivering steel made with a hydrogen-based process that emits zero greenhouse gasses. Steel production accounts for around 7 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, decarbonizing the industry with hydrogen would require $278 billion in investment through 2050.  On the production side, green hydrogen also needs to scale up to drive down costs. The question is whether countries and companies can brute force an entire clean hydrogen industry into existence fast enough to meet climate targets.  For its part, California thinks hydrogen is worthwhile. Last October, the California Air Resources Board put out a report on hydrogen infrastructure in the state. Looking at various scenarios, the report concluded California could run a self-sufficient hydrogen network servicing 1.8 million fuel cell cars by 2035 with about $300 million in state funding. Toyota, meanwhile, is hedging. The company is investing $17.6 billion to produce a line of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. Daimler is also pursuing battery-electric trucks alongside hydrogen. Batteries have experienced a stunning 97 percent drop in costs over the last 30 years, and battery-powered vehicles are already gaining ground around the world.  Some analysts are skeptical that hydrogen could ever catch up, at least for cars and trucks. “[T]he window of opportunity to establish a relevant market share for hydrogen cars is as good as closed,” argued Patrick Plötz, coordinator of the energy economy business unit at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in Germany, in Nature Electronics earlier this year. For trucks, manufacturers and governments need to make stronger and faster efforts to deploy them if they have any hope of hitting highways. “If truck manufacturers do not start the mass production of fuel cell trucks soon to reduce costs, such vehicles will never succeed in low-carbon road transport,” he wrote. But Plötz said hydrogen still could play important roles in decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and industry.  So even though some of the largest car and truck manufacturers are trying to force a hydrogen economy into existence, it could be yet another false start. After decades of hype and continued growing pains, it’s tough to get excited about hydrogen again. But the potential for hydrogen as a pillar of clean energy is impossible to ignore, and with more investment than ever and the urgent need for tools to slow climate change, this might be the moment it finally ignites.

They became paperweights at that point in our driveways,” Mobley said. \nCompare these ordeals to battery-electric cars, which can charge up just about anywhere there is a power outlet or at one of the fast-charging stations cropping up quickly around the country. \nSo while hydrogen cars themselves may be excellent, the weak infrastructure to support them continues to hold them back. \nThe infrastructure hydrogen needs poses its own technical challenges. \nIt requires high-pressure pumps, fittings, and storage containers, many of which are expensive boutique products. \nThe Covid-19 pandemic then threw up another roadblock, disrupting the supply chains for hydrogen construction projects. \n“These pumps are all handmade,” Mobley said. \n“When the entire world shuts down and nobody’s in there manufacturing the bolts and nuts and seals, pretty much we saw the construction halt.” \nThe hope now is that with larger players like trucking and delivery companies investing in their own hydrogen vehicles, they will drive economies of scale for everyone. \nWith larger vehicles, planned routes, and centralized fueling, these industrial uses might be even a better use for hydrogen than passenger cars. \n“As we rotate into more of the trucking industry getting into using hydrogen technology, the infrastructure is going to be beefed up considerably,” Mobley said. \nDaimler Truck, for example, is one of the world’s largest manufacturers of commercial vehicles, accounting for about 58 percent of the market for large highway trucks. \nThe company has already received approval for a hydrogen-powered truck in Germany and expects to begin delivering hydrogen trucks to customers in 2027. \nIt’s also a shareholder in H2 Mobility Deutschland, a hydrogen fueling station operator that recently raised 110 million euros from investors. \nIn addition, Daimler has teamed up with Volvo to build a fuel cell factory scheduled to begin operation in 2025. \nMeanwhile, delivery firms like DHL, Royal Mail, FedEx, UPS, and Swiss Post are currently testing out hydrogen vehicles on their routes. \nAs for industrial uses, Swedish steel manufacturer Hybrit last year began delivering steel made with a hydrogen-based process that emits zero greenhouse gasses. \nSteel production accounts for around 7 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. \nAccording to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, decarbonizing the industry with hydrogen would require $278 billion in investment through 2050. \nOn the production side, green hydrogen also needs to scale up to drive down costs. \nThe question is whether countries and companies can brute force an entire clean hydrogen industry into existence fast enough to meet climate targets. \nFor its part, California thinks hydrogen is worthwhile. \nLast October, the California Air Resources Board put out a report on hydrogen infrastructure in the state. \nLooking at various scenarios, the report concluded California could run a self-sufficient hydrogen network servicing 1.8 million fuel cell cars by 2035 with about $300 million in state funding. \nToyota, meanwhile, is hedging. \nThe company is investing $17.6 billion to produce a line of 30 battery electric vehicles by 2030. \nDaimler is also pursuing battery-electric trucks alongside hydrogen. \nBatteries have experienced a stunning 97 percent drop in costs over the last 30 years, and battery-powered vehicles are already gaining ground around the world. \nSome analysts are skeptical that hydrogen could ever catch up, at least for cars and trucks. \n“[T]he window of opportunity to establish a relevant market share for hydrogen cars is as good as closed,” argued Patrick Plötz, coordinator of the energy economy business unit at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research in Germany, in Nature Electronics earlier this year. \nFor trucks, manufacturers and governments need to make stronger and faster efforts to deploy them if they have any hope of hitting highways. \n“If truck manufacturers do not start the mass production of fuel cell trucks soon to reduce costs, such vehicles will never succeed in low-carbon road transport,” he wrote. \nBut Plötz said hydrogen still could play important roles in decarbonizing aviation, shipping, and industry. \nSo even though some of the largest car and truck manufacturers are trying to force a hydrogen economy into existence, it could be yet another false start. \nAfter decades of hype and continued growing pains, it’s tough to get excited about hydrogen again. \nBut the potential for hydrogen as a pillar of clean energy is impossible to ignore, and with more investment than ever and the urgent need for tools to slow climate change, this might be the moment it finally ignites.",

        "text": "In a time of noise, confusion, and spin, we’re committed to clarity, truth, and depth — even when it’s hard. That kind of journalism isn’t easy. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Buildings waste a lot of energy. One low-tech solution could fix that. This story is part of Recode by Vox’s Tech Support series, which explores solutions for our warming world. The world is buzzing with climate change solutions these days: Maybe we can plant a trillion trees to save ecosystems and scrub greenhouse gases out of the air in one fell swoop! Or store energy in giant cement blocks that can act like batteries made of potential energy! Or use our electric vehicles as batteries for our homes and businesses! These sound like promising ideas, but some are only in the early stages. Many of them will take years to come to fruition, if they ever do at all, and there’s a fair amount of disagreement about how effective some of them would be. Which is why it’s time we start thinking more about a low-tech, time-tested, and far less sexy solution: insulation. Buildings are responsible for 40 percent of energy consumption in the United States, more than half of which goes toward heating and cooling. With the majority of the country’s energy still coming from fossil fuels, reducing that energy consumption would have significant climate impacts. According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, residential energy efficiency could be the largest source of reduced greenhouse gas emissions in the US, and a 2016 study showed that increasing insulation in all the single-family homes in the country would lead to annual reductions of 80 million tons of carbon dioxide from power plants. That amounts to about 4.7 percent of the annual carbon emissions from American power plants, or the equivalent of taking 15.6 million gas-powered cars off the road. The reduced energy needs would make it easier for utility companies to transition to clean energy, and as the latest alarming Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report makes clear, every bit counts.  “Efficiency is one of those things that people don’t think about a lot, but actually it’s huge,” said Victor Olgyay, principal architect in the carbon-free buildings program at RMI, a think tank that studies sustainability. Olgyay, as his title might suggest, happens to be the kind of person who does spend a lot of time thinking about efficiency, and he has firsthand experience with the difference a little insulation can make. After he and his wife Kristy bought a 1950s-era ranch-style home in central Boulder, Colorado, in 2004, they found that the house, being as old as it was, wasn’t very good at staying warm in the Colorado winter. Rather than crank the heat, Olgyay reached for the fluffy stuff.  Insulation works on a simple concept: It keeps the outside out and the inside in. “The primary purpose of a building is to provide shelter,” Christoph Reinhart, director of the building technology program at MIT, told Recode. “Being thermally separated, reducing conduction, is always good.” A well-insulated building isn’t just good at staying warm; insulation also keeps indoor spaces cool for longer, without using any extra energy. Take Olgyay’s own house. After spending a few weekends stuffing fluffy insulation into the attic, filling wall cavities and gaps between floor joists, wrapping air ducts and water pipes in the crawlspace underneath the house, and sealing gaps around windows and doors, the ranch home became fairly airtight. That means that in the winter, heat from the furnace will stay inside the house — which means the furnace will run less often. In the summer, Olgyay’s family can open their windows at night to let in the cool air and shut them during the day to keep out the heat. With the addition of a small rooftop solar panel system installed in 2007 that could provide most of the power they needed, their only major reliance on utility companies — and on fossil fuels — came through the couple hundred dollars they spent on their gas bill each year. A well-insulated building isn’t just good at staying warm; insulation also keeps indoor spaces cool for longer, without using any extra energy Few buildings in the country are as well-insulated as Olgyay’s home. As Vox’s Umair Irfan wrote in a 2019 story detailing the poor state of insulation around the country, commercial buildings waste 30 percent of the energy they consume, while 90 percent of American homes are under-insulated. That can have serious consequences beyond the climate impacts, directly affecting the people living in these homes: A 20-year study published in 2021 found that global heat-related deaths are on the rise, with more than 5 million deaths each year attributed to extreme heat or cold.  Improving insulation, Olgyay says, can increase the “passive survivability” of a building, or the length of time buildings stay at a comfortable temperature without power. That’s particularly important as extreme weather is on the rise across the country, bringing power blackouts in its wake. The majority of deaths in New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Ida, which hit the city in the summer of 2021, were attributed to residents being trapped inside their homes without air conditioning; 161 deaths in the wake of a winter storm that caused mass blackouts in Texas in early 2021 were attributed to exposure to the cold.  So the solution sounds simple, right? Just add some insulation into our walls, make buildings more comfortable and more climate-friendly, and call it a day?  Sadly, it’s not quite that easy. To begin with, most existing building owners — whether of single-family homes, apartment buildings, or commercial spaces — tend to think of the structure of their buildings as mostly fixed, and the prospect of padding attics with insulation or drilling holes into walls to blow insulation into the gaps between studs is daunting and expensive. Homeowners, Reinhart said, are more likely to focus on energy-efficient improvements like LED bulbs or new refrigerators that can be easily swapped in and out without major renovation work.  “It’s really disruptive to insulate in most cases,” Reinhart told Recode. Part of the problem is that if a house already has some insulation, even if it isn’t very efficient, removing it to make space for new insulation is very difficult — something Reinhart is hoping to find a solution for that wouldn’t require extensive renovation work.  The expense also means making improvements to insulation is only an option for people with enough disposable income to cover the cost without government assistance. The US Department of Energy does have a Weatherization Assistance Program for low-income households that’s meant to help with the cost, though the funds are administered at a state and local level and require homeowners to jump through bureaucratic hoops to receive assistance. And renters — who make up about 36 percent of the nation’s households — are left at the mercy of their landlords. “The rental situation has what we call a split incentive,” Olgyay said. “You’ve got people living there who are usually paying the utility bills, and then you’ve got a landlord who doesn’t see that and so has no incentive to improve the efficiency of the place.”  Commercial buildings waste 30 percent of the energy they consume, while 90 percent of American homes are under-insulated Some groups, like the Institution for Market Transformation, a nonprofit that advocates for the role of buildings as environmental and societal solutions, have proposed the idea of “green leases” that would incentivize landlords to increase the sustainability of their buildings. The idea, essentially, is that landlords will spend money to make their buildings more energy-efficient, and the cost savings the tenants might see from reduced utility bills would instead go to the landlord to pay for those upgrades. There’s little agreement on how those leases should work, however; unless landlords across the country were to suddenly become exceedingly concerned about climate change of their own free will (and tenants, in turn, were to agree to higher rents in exchange for lower utility bills), green leases would probably need some sort of governmental push to become a reality.  It’s also important to think about how we should insulate our buildings as they are constructed. The amount of insulation put into a building is usually decided by a timeline of how quickly the insulation’s benefits will recoup the upfront cost, Olgyay said, and building codes tend to focus on quicker cost recoupment rather than high energy efficiency. “What that doesn’t really account for is the ability to have deeper cost savings,” Olgyay told Recode. If new buildings were constructed with more effective insulation, they would need to use air conditioners and heaters less often — saving more energy and money in the long run.  Builders also need to start thinking about how their buildings impact the environment simply by being constructed, Olgyay said. According to a recent report Olgyay co-authored, at least one-quarter of the carbon emissions of buildings come from the construction process, part of which comes from the nature of the materials used in constructing those buildings. Those materials essentially lock in a building’s carbon footprint from the very beginning — a concept known as embodied carbon. Insulation is a good example of this: Most insulation used nowadays is made from plastic, making it high in embodied carbon. Switching to insulation with low or no embodied carbon, such as insulation made from organic materials like cotton or cellulose, would reduce a building’s embodied carbon by 16 percent without any increase in costs.  All of these fixes would require us to change how we think about insulation, or to start thinking about it in the first place. But it’s time, Olgyay and Reinhart told Recode. Improving building insulation — and pairing those improvements with other technologies that would reduce the use of fossil fuels, like rooftop solar panels and electric heat pumps — is key to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Better buildings will need to be more efficient down to their very bones. “It’s just an integral part, the insulation,” Reinhart said. “If you have this vision of a great future for society, you need the insulation too. You can’t sidestep that.”  Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? How closing tax havens can fund climate policy. Governments have long tried pricing carbon to induce companies to make the kind of serious emissions reductions actually needed to address the climate emergency. They’ve done this by imposing a carbon tax, an additional fee for each ton of carbon dioxide emitted, or through “cap and trade” schemes, which give companies limited allowances for how much CO2 they can emit and then allow them to buy and sell those allowances to offer more flexibility. The idea is that pricing carbon will decrease CO2 emissions over time by making polluting so expensive that companies have the incentive to find cleaner ways to operate. However, pricing carbon hasn’t been very effective at reducing emissions by the dramatic levels needed to avert the most catastrophic effects of climate change. And taxing carbon has proven unpopular in many places in the world because it usually means people have to pay more for everyday costs.  But that hasn’t stopped governments from trying it. Jessica F. Green, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto whose work focuses on global environmental politics, argues that’s partly because focusing on the technicalities of carbon pricing is a good way to avoid addressing the harder problem of actually ending fossil fuel use. “We’ve been working on how to measure carbon for 30 years and we’re still debating about or refining what it is because it’s easier to do that than it is to actually decarbonize,” Green told me.  Green argues in a new paper that climate change is not a “market failure” to be fixed through mechanisms like carbon pricing. Rather, she says, it’s “a problem of societal transformation” that requires “strong state intervention to reorganize the economy.” Green says countries should aggressively pursue taxation (one of the basic functions of the state), but of the rich — and use the money generated to fund climate policy. “The climate crisis has not been caused equally by everyone. Rich people cause climate problems,” Green said. I called Green to find out more about why carbon pricing, and especially carbon taxes, haven’t worked so well and why she thinks taxing the rich might. Our conversation, edited for clarity and length, is below. What would you say is the main idea of your paper? If something doesn’t work very well, we should try something else. That’s the bottom line. And what we know from the empirical record on carbon pricing is that it doesn’t do a whole lot to actually reduce carbon emissions, and even less to facilitate decarbonization. When countries do see emissions reductions, they are often from things like efficiency improvements or switching away from coal to fossil gas. These things aren’t bad, but they’re not going to get us to net-zero emissions by 2050, which is what countries have agreed to do under the Paris Agreement. So are you saying we should just forget about carbon pricing altogether? Do you think there’s an aspect of the policy that’s worth saving? It’s a really tricky problem, but I think, in an ideal world, we’d just get rid of it. Because today, for example, there’s an article in the Washington Post which explains how the American Petroleum Institute is strongly considering backing a carbon tax — which is a signal that this policy has been completely co-opted by the people that it’s supposed to be regulating. When you have big, powerful oil and gas firms that are also backing a carbon tax, that should be a signal that the ideal conditions under which such a policy could function will likely not materialize, because these interests are very powerful, and they’re so entrenched in the governments that are trying to regulate them. What about the European Union’s experience with carbon pricing? I feel like the EU has been effective in implementing a carbon tax, right? The EU story is positive, but it has taken a long time. The EU’s Emissions Trading System was first created in 2005 and for the first three years, the program was a wash in terms of emissions reductions. (Which is understandable because they were getting the policy off the ground). But throughout the last I would say 11 or 12 years, they’ve made a lot of improvements on the functioning of the market. Carbon prices were very volatile, but they’re now more stable — they’ve actually increased. They have really dealt with their supply problem — because they had a huge oversupply, which was causing a glut in the market and driving down prices. They created a stability mechanism, a market stability reserve, which works like a central bank, controlling the supply. Sounds pretty good to me! What hasn’t the EU gotten right? I looked at the studies of the EU’s actual performance: If you try to isolate how much emissions fell because of the EU’s Emissions Trading System, estimates have only placed it at around one to three percent per year, which is not a lot. Plus, the EU is a set of countries that are very wealthy and have a significant regulatory capacity. I mean, they are literally armies of bureaucrats who are working on this issue. And they have a lot of political will. So in many ways, the EU has been the most likely case for success — and it’s still not that great. So it’s a success story in a way, but it’s still not effective enough. I’d like to talk more about what you’re proposing countries do instead of, or at least in addition to, carbon pricing. The argument involves getting countries to change their tax policies to eliminate corporate tax havens, is that right? The basic idea is that each country makes its own laws about how much they tax individuals and corporations, and the rules around transparency. A handful of countries, including the UK through [overseas territories] like the British Virgin Islands, have set their corporate tax rates very low or nothing at all. So if you are a multinational corporation like Google or Amazon, or an oil and gas company, you can say, “Okay, well, then I’m going to have some of my company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. And if I report my profits, they will only get taxed at 3 percent, as opposed to 15 percent back in the UK. So that’s just literally money in the bank. And as long as I don’t repatriate that money to the UK, I don’t have to pay taxes on that money.” It gets really complicated — international tax law is very complex. But there are ways you can create subsidiaries or parts of a corporation and route your money in different ways to take advantage of the most advantageous tax laws. Jariel Arvin: Are there any countries you’d say are worse than others when it comes to doing this? Jessica Green: There’s a handful: Switzerland, the Netherlands, the UK with its overseas territories and protectorates like the Cayman Islands, Jersey, the Isle of Man, and Bermuda; and the Bahamas. Okay, so I think I get how these corporate tax havens work and why companies use them. But how does this relate to climate change? Is it that this kind of financial secrecy enables companies to engage in bad environmental behavior without facing economic consequences? There are two ways. One is direct: We know, for instance, that [many] firms that offshore their wealth are linked to deforestation in the Amazon. These are companies that are doing bad environmental stuff, and they have money to do that in part because they offshore some of their wealth. The second way is indirect. If you believe — as I do as a political scientist — that money is power, well: We know that fossil fuel companies are offshoring some of their profits, which makes them wealthier and therefore more powerful in their ability to influence political processes to slow down decarbonization policy. Closing tax loopholes seems like it would be a relatively simple thing for governments to do, so why do you think it isn’t getting done? From my perspective, it’s actually an easier political sell. Taxing the rich resonates with people a lot more than taxing carbon. First of all, people are like, “What’s carbon? I don’t know. What does that mean for me? Increased costs for the basic things that I use every day?” On the other hand, taxing the rich is like saying countries should take care of making sure that there’s enough revenue and go get the bad guys who are not paying their fair share. How do countries actually go about “taxing the rich”? There are a few ways to do that. One is unilateral: Countries can just say, “If you have goods or employ people in country X, that’s where you have to report your profits, you can’t report your profits someplace else.” That’s a unilateral measure. And politically, it could be difficult. It is a question of political will. But I think that the political sell is easier, and technically, in many ways, much less complex. We’re not arguing about how to quantify and sell the absence of a thing [which is what carbon offsets would require] — we’re talking about making rich people pay their fair share. Once countries do have that extra money from closing tax loopholes, how do we make sure that it actually goes to climate policy? Therein lies the rub. There’s no guarantee that the money will go to the “right” climate causes, but what it comes down to is really thinking about climate change as a question of inequality of wealth distribution. What closing corporate tax holes will do is make these corporations and individuals less rich — and that’s actually an important goal in and of itself. Because, you know, if one percent of the global population has emitted as much as the poorest 50 percent, then climate change is really a wealth inequality problem. And so to the extent that you can constrain the extreme wealth of these actors, you’re taking a step in the right direction. That’s my best answer to that question because it’s a really hard question. I agree that this is definitely the question moving forward, and it’s difficult to answer as you say. But I think it’s an easier question to answer than: “How do we actually make carbon pricing work?” I think so, too. We’ve now had 30 years of experience on carbon pricing, and not a hell of a lot to show for it. Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

As the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine ripples across the globe, the response of some nations to the growing energy crisis has been to double down on fossil fuels – pouring billions more dollars into the coal, oil and gas that are driving our deepening climate emergency. Meanwhile all climate indicators continue to break records, forecasting a future of ferocious storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and unlivable temperatures in vast swathes of the planet. Our world faces climate chaos. New funding for fossil fuel exploration and production infrastructure is delusional. Fossil fuels are not the answer, nor will they ever be. We can see the damage we are doing to the planet and our societies. It is in the news every day, and no one is immune. Fossil fuels are the cause of the climate crisis. Renewable energy is the answer – to limit climate disruption and boost energy security. Had we invested earlier and massively in renewable energy, we would not find ourselves once again at the mercy of unstable fossil fuel markets. Renewables are the peace plan of the 21st century. But the battle for a rapid and just energy transition is not being fought on a level field. Investors are still backing fossil fuels, and governments still hand out billions in subsidies for coal, oil and gas – about $11 million every minute. There is a word for favoring short-term relief over long-term well-being. Addiction. We are still addicted to fossil fuels. For the health of our societies and planet, we need to quit. Now. The only true path to energy security, stable power prices, prosperity and a livable planet lies in abandoning polluting fossil fuels and accelerating the renewables-based energy transition. To that end, I have called on the governments of the Group of 20 industrial and emerging-market nations to dismantle coal infrastructure, with a full phaseout by 2030 for the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries and 2040 for all others. I have urged financial actors to abandon fossil fuel finance and invest in renewable energy. And I have proposed a five-point plan to boost renewable energy round the world. ►First, we must make renewable energy technology a global public good, including removing intellectual property barriers to technology transfer. ►Second, we must improve global access to supply chains for renewable energy technologies components and raw materials. In 2020, the world installed 5 gigawatts of battery storage. We need 600 gigawatts of storage capacity by 2030. Clearly, we need a global coalition to get there. Shipping bottlenecks and supply-chain constraints, as well as higher costs for lithium and other battery metals, are hurting deployment of such technologies and materials just as we need them most. ►Third, we must cut the red tape that holds up solar and wind projects. We need fast-track approvals and more effort to modernize electricity grids. It takes up to eight years to approve a wind farm in the European Union and 10 years in the United States. In South Korea, onshore wind projects need 22 permits from eight ministries. ►Fourth, the world must shift energy subsidies from fossil fuels to protect vulnerable people from energy shocks and invest in a just transition to sustainable future. ►Fifth, we need to triple investments in renewables. This includes multilateral development banks and development finance institutions, as well as commercial banks. All must step up and dramatically boost investments in renewables. We need more urgency from all global leaders. We are already perilously close to hitting the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit that science tells us is the maximum level of warming to avoid the worst climate impacts. To keep 1.5 alive, we must reduce emissions by 45% by 2030 and reach net zero emissions by mid-century. But current national commitments will lead to an increase of almost 14% this decade. That spells catastrophe. The answer lies in renewables – for climate action, for energy security and for providing clean electricity to the hundreds of millions of people who now lack it. Renewables are a triple win. There is no excuse for anyone to reject a renewables revolution. While oil and gas prices have reached record levels, renewables are getting cheaper all the time. The cost of solar energy and batteries has plummeted 85% over the past decade. Wind turbine prices have fallen by 55-60%. And investment in renewables creates up to three times more jobs than fossil fuels. Of course, renewables are not the only answer to the climate crisis. Nature-based solutions, such as reversing deforestation and land degradation, are essential. So, too, are efforts to promote energy efficiency. Even so, a rapid renewable energy transition must be our ambition. As we wean ourselves off fossil fuels, the benefits will be vast, and not just to the climate. Energy prices will be lower and more predictable, with positive knock-on effects for food and economic security. When energy prices rise, so do the costs of food and all the goods we rely on. So, let us all agree that a rapid renewables revolution is necessary and stop fiddling while our future burns. António Guterres is the ninth secretary-general of the United Nations.",

        "title": "Renewable energy sources can produce 24/7 power. Here's how",
        "text": "In February 2021, the electric grid failed in Texas. A particularly brutal winter storm system had struck the state and, as temperatures plunged, millions of people were without power or heat for days. Pipes burst, flooding homes. Water treatment facilities went offline. Hundreds of people died. \"People were literally burning furniture inside their house for heat,\" Selena Xie, president of the Austin EMS Association, told USA TODAY. Politicians and other public figures were quick to blame the tragedy on renewable power. \"It never would have been an issue had our grid not been so deeply penetrated by renewable energy sources that contribute the least when they are needed the most,\" Texas Public Policy Foundation, a state think tank, said in a statement. These claims echoed a widespread belief seen in mainstream political discourse and social media chatter that replacing “reliable” fossil fuel power sources with “unreliable” renewable power technologies will inevitably lead to catastrophe. However, renewables were unfairly blamed for the disaster in Texas. While wind facilities did underperform or fail, the outage was primarily caused by the failure of natural gas infrastructure and supply chains, experts said. Claims that renewables are intrinsically unreliable are also off base. Renewable energy sources are necessary to reduce CO2 emissions from the electric grid and the escalating harms caused by global warming, and with proper planning grids can increase use of these resources without sacrificing reliability, experts told USA TODAY. “The truth of it is every resource has its own unique characteristics to plan for,” said Trieu Mai, a researcher in the Grid Planning and Analysis Center at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. “There is no intrinsic reason why a renewables-based grid would be more prone to blackouts. But it does require planners to account for the characteristics of those renewables when they do their planning.” To deal with the intermittent nature of some renewables, grid planners have a variety of strategies in mind: For an electric grid to work properly, operators must make sure that power supply meets power demand instantly – managing random fluctuations in consumer use and the typical peaks and troughs of the day or year. Renewables like solar or wind that fluctuate with weather add another layer of complication. Some fluctuations are predictable − such as solar power production increasing as the sun rises and peaking in the afternoon − but others are less so. “Renewable generation could swing rapidly and suddenly within a region due to cloud coverage or wind speed or direction changes,” said Andy Sun, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology electric power systems professor. One option for managing these fluctuations is to store energy that is produced when power is plentiful and use it when power becomes scarce. This strategy functionally transforms \"intermittent\" renewable power into \"dispatchable power\" − meaning the power is guaranteed to be available for a given time, even if the weather is bad. Giant lithium-ion batteries – the variety found in electric cars and cell phones – are being rapidly deployed for this purpose. The most common utility-scale lithium-ion battery stores power for about four hours, enough to push through, for instance, an evening peak demand period after solar plants have largely stopped producing, according to Mai. “In the longer term … you might need to shift it further than four hours,” he said. “What we see in our analysis is an increasing duration of energy storage needed as you significantly increase renewables on the grid.”  Other technologies can store power for longer and require less intensively mined minerals than batteries. For instance, pumped storage hydropower has been used for energy storage for decades, according to Robert Armstrong, chair of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Energy Initiative's 2022 report, \"The Future of Energy Storage.\" In this system, excess energy produced during peak production periods – such as mid-afternoon on a solar-driven grid – is used to pump water up an incline to a reservoir. When energy is needed, the water is released to flow back downhill, creating electricity by spinning a turbine. These facilities can store many hours' worth of energy depending on their size.  Other energy storage strategies, which are in varying stages of research and development, include: Another option to fill the gaps on cloudy days or windless nights is importing renewable power from elsewhere via electrical transmission lines, according to Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University. \"When the wind is not blowing in one place, it is often blowing somewhere else, and vice versa,\" he told USA TODAY in an email. Currently, the U.S. electric grid is divided into three broad sections that operate almost independently of each other and differ in renewable resource distribution and abundance. Connecting the eastern and western parts through increased transmission capacity could help the U.S. make better use of its abundant renewable resources, according to a 2021 study led by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. For instance, these improvements would allow excess solar power from the Southwest to support Eastern communities during peak demand, according to the Department of Energy. Likewise, Midwestern wind power could be sent in the opposite direction as the sun sets on the West Coast. Large interconnected grids allow \"resources of different types – meaning solar, geothermal, hydropower and various storage technologies – to work together,\" Mai said. This sort of resource coordination, or resource diversity, is itself an important strategy for keeping the lights on. For wind and solar energy specifically, grid operators can take advantage of a convenient characteristic that allows them to be used in tandem. \"Wind and solar, which are both ... intermittent resources, are complementary in nature,\" Jacobson said. \"When the sun is not shining, the wind is often blowing ... and vice versa. Thus, combining wind and solar on the grid smooths out the overall electricity supply over time.\" Planners can take advantage of this quality by coordinating wind and solar across the U.S., within a specific region, or even within the same power plant, Caitlyn Clark, a National Renewable Energy Laboratory researcher and co-author of a 2022 hybrid power plant study, told USA TODAY. Including other types of renewables brings additional benefits.  For instance, both hydropower and geothermal power can offer dispatchable power to the grid, which may reduce the need for storage in areas where these resources are available. And geothermal technologies can also reduce the amount of demand on the electric grid by providing direct heating and cooling in buildings, Amanda Kolker, the geothermal energy laboratory program manager at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY.  Reducing demand, or at least moving demand around in time, is yet another key strategy for managing a renewables-dominated grid, experts say. This can be accomplished with demand response initiatives, which provide incentives for consumers to reduce power consumption during times of peak demand. This can help shift demand to better coincide with peak wind and solar energy production. \"Right now our mindset is, 'There's demand for power out there and we have to create an electric grid to serve it,'\" Jim Robb, CEO of North American Electric Reliability Corporation, an electric grid regulatory authority, told USA TODAY. \"Another way to think about this problem is ... 'How do we shape the demand curve to take advantage of what the system naturally wants to produce?'” Such programs have already been deployed to avoid blackouts on fossil fuel-dominated grids. For example, one Texas utility remotely accesses the thermostats of program participants and adjusts them by 2 to 4 degrees to reduce community power usage during peak demand or extreme weather. The participants receive financial compensation and can override the adjustments manually if they choose. A 2021 study found incentive-driven demand response programs have the potential to reduce the power needed during Texas summer and winter peak demand by 19,000 megawatts. That's about the same amount of electricity that would be generated during peak demand by 10 or 11 recently proposed new gas power plants, according to a press release for the study. Wind, solar, hydropower and geothermal energy produced about 20% of U.S. power in 2022. Researchers say that, through the right combination of the available strategies (tailored to different geographic areas), significantly higher levels are attainable in the near term. This is true even when accounting for the increasing demand associated with electrifying other sectors of the economy, such as transportation. Multiple research groups have proposed models of renewables-dominated systems. For example, Jacobson and his colleagues modeled a grid that would run on 100% solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, tidal and wave power and storage by 2050. Mai and other researchers modeled various scenarios where a combination of wind, solar, hydropower and storage could contribute up to 95% of electricity by 2035, with fossil fuels and nuclear making up much of the rest. However, he said including nuclear and fossil fuels in this mix doesn't mean those power sources are intrinsically necessary to “back up” a renewables-driven grid, as some have claimed.  “When we do our research over what a 100% renewable or low-carbon grid would look like, we often find lots of solutions that we think may work,” Mai said. “There are really no pure technical challenges where if you hit ‘X’ percent (renewables), it can't be done. Or at least we have not found such a case.\" The speed at which a reliable grid driven by 100% renewable power – or close to it – can be built out isn’t just a technological question, Mai said. Political will, economics, supply chain strength, policy decisions and planning decisions very much determine how quickly the future low-carbon grid can be constructed and how reliable it will be. And careful planning that accounts for all the variables is key. For instance, substantial new transmission infrastructure will be necessary to build out a reliable renewables-driven grid, Mai said. However, permitting for new transmission lines is difficult, and some proposed transmission projects (as well as some solar and wind projects) have met resistance due to social, cultural, ecological and wildlife impacts.  This conflict has created tension around the future of the grid, but Jacobson said the amount of transmission necessary to support reliability is somewhat flexible. Additional storage could make up for less-than-ideal transmission infrastructure. Smart transmission technologies and advanced conducting materials can also help reduce the amount of new transmission needed by allowing planners to use existing transmission infrastructure more efficiently, according to Brad Klein, an attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, who co-authored the center’s 2021 report on the subject. For example, the amount of power that can be sent through a given transmission line is determined by weather and temperature, but planners currently limit the amount of transmitted power based on conservative worst-case weather conditions, Klein said. Smart dynamic line rating technology can be used to quickly adjust the amount of power flowing through wires based on real-time weather data − allowing more power flow when conditions are ideal. While new transmission projects may take a long time to be built, smart grid tech can be deployed now to make the existing grid better equipped to disperse renewable power, according to Klein. “It's a way to do things better, cheaper, faster and with less environmental impact and less controversy and less land use dispute,” he said. Additionally, smart tech deployment would let the “new transmission facilities we build operate more efficiently, so we can ‘right size’ the amount of new transmission we need and avoid overbuilding.” Whatever the balance of transmission, storage and other strategies ends up being implemented, a grid dominated by wind and solar must also use new techniques to deal with electrical disturbances such as faults or grid frequency fluctuations, Robb said. Currently, mechanical components in gas, coal, nuclear, hydropower and geothermal plants help the grid adjust when there is a disturbance, but solar and wind power plants lack these components.  To maintain reliability, replacement technologies that can help grid operators respond to problems must be widely incorporated into wind and solar plants or elsewhere on the grid before too many coal and gas plants go offline, according to Robb.  “The way I describe it is that we inherited our grandfather's electric system,” he said. \"We're going to create an electric system we're going to leave for our grandchildren. And it's going to be very, very different.”",

        "title": "Renewable energy: Why US counties often ban solar, wind power plants",
        "text": "Across America’s power grid, there’s a growing gap between what we need and what we’ll allow. As the planet warms and climate disasters grow more costly, the U.S. has set a target to reach 100% clean energy by 2035, a goal that depends on building large-scale solar and wind power.  A nationwide analysis by USA TODAY shows local governments are banning green energy faster than they’re building it.  At least 15% of counties in the U.S. have effectively halted new utility-scale wind, solar, or both, USA TODAY found. These limits come through outright bans, moratoriums, construction impediments and other conditions that make green energy difficult to build.  The impediments come as a gigantic effort to build green energy also is underway. U.S. energy from commercial wind and solar is expected to hit 19% by 2025, and those sources are expected to surpass the amount of electricity made from coal this year.  But green energy must increase radically over the next 11 years to meet U.S. goals. And those projects are becoming harder to build.  In the past decade, about 180 counties got their first commercial wind-power projects. But in the same period, more than twice as many blocked wind development. And while solar power has found more broad acceptance, 2023 was the first year to see almost as many individual counties block new solar projects as the ones adding their first projects.  The result: Some of the areas with the nation's best sources of wind and solar power have now been boxed out.   Because large-scale solar and wind projects typically are built outside city limits, USA TODAY’s analysis focuses on restrictions by the county-level governments that have jurisdiction. In a few cases, such as Connecticut, Tennessee and Vermont, entire states have implemented near-statewide restrictions.  While 15% of America’s counties might sound like a small portion, the trend has significant consequences, says Jeff Danielson, a former four-term Iowa state senator now with the Clean Grid Alliance. “It’s 15% of the most highly productive areas to develop wind and solar,” he said. “Our overall goals are going to be difficult to achieve if the answer is ‘No’ in county after county.” The country’s green-energy deadline now sits just 11 years away. But even if politicians fail to meet that goal, another clock is ticking.  Last year, 2023, was the warmest in recorded history, warmer than any other in 125,000 years. And with rising temperatures come rising risks: stronger hurricanes in the Atlantic, more severe cloudbursts in storms across North America, increasing drought in the Great Plains, larger wildfires in the West.   Construction isn’t happening fast enough to meet the country’s green energy needs, said Grace Wu, a professor of energy resources at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  “I’m worried about what’s ahead,” she said. The transition to green energy involves a profound national shift: a move from power plants that mostly burned coal, then natural gas, to new wind and solar installations. That also means shifting much of the nation’s energy generation to new regions, specifically the large wind belt down the middle of the country and the sunny southeast and southwest.  “Clean energy” includes other emissions-free sources such as nuclear (18%) and hydropower (6%). But both of those are controversial in their own right and unlikely to see major expansion in the U.S.  And sources such as rooftop solar panels on houses or businesses, while helpful, provide just a tiny fraction of the total power supply.   In the Northeast, several coastal states have instead made plans to rely on offshore wind turbines. But a wave of disinformation in 2023, falsely claiming offshore wind projects killed whales, resulted in a sharp decline in public support for offshore wind. The only likely way to shift away from fossil fuels quickly is a sharp increase in solar and wind farms big enough to replace power plants, each one powering tens of thousands of homes.  The total amount of energy a solar plant can make varies widely based on size and location. The average-size solar plant today can power about 20,000 homes. A field of wind turbines can be similar, as each turbine can power about 1,000 homes.  The first large-scale wind farm in the U.S. started running nearly 50 years ago, in the aftermath of a global oil crisis. Built in Southern California, it powered more than 4,000 homes.  Wind power gained momentum in the early 2000s thanks to better technology and tax incentives.  But the number of new wind projects opening annually peaked in the early 2010s, according to inventory data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and has slowed since then. Wind power is expected to grow 11% by 2025 from last year’s levels. In the past 10 years, 183 counties saw their first wind projects come online. However, USA TODAY’s analysis found that in the same period, nearly 375 counties have essentially blocked new wind development. That’s almost as many as the 508 counties – out of 3,144 total in the U.S. – currently home to an operational wind turbine.  Utility-scale solar plants, using solar panels that have grown dramatically more efficient, have proliferated in the past decade. The U.S. added a record 33 gigawatts of solar power in 2023, and solar is expected to grow 75% by 2025. More than 1,000 counties now host solar farms. “A solar panel in my part of Michigan produces 70% of the solar power the same panel in Phoenix, Arizona, does. Most people would expect the difference to be much bigger,” said Sarah Mills, a professor of urban planning at the University of Michigan who studies energy policy and land use. However, opposition also has shot up, according to USA TODAY’s analysis. Of the 116 counties implementing bans or impediments to utility-scale solar plants, half did so in 2023 alone. This surge in obstacles is unprecedented since green-energy technology gained broad acceptance. “The local regulation landscape for renewables is changing quickly,” said Tamara Ogle, a member of the land use team at Purdue University Extension who inventoried Indiana’s renewable energy ordinances in 2022. Despite growing hostility, green energy can be an economic windfall in places that welcome it.  Much like places such as Texas and Alaska grew rich when drilling companies struck oil, solar and wind power can bring in both construction work and cash, in the form of leases and tax revenue from the power plants.  “You're talking hundreds of millions of dollars of economic impact in these counties, many of which are shrinking,” said Alan Anderson, who heads the energy practice at the law firm of Polsinelli in Kansas City, Missouri. Rural counties lower their property tax bills, Anderson said, when green energy tax money flows in. In all, the nation will get about 12% of its electricity supply from wind and about 7% from utility-scale solar by 2025. But that’s a long way from the 60% to 80% we’ll need in addition to nuclear and hydropower.  And building any energy source is a compromise, said Thomas Daniels, a professor of land and environmental planning at the University of Pennsylvania’s Weitzman School of Design. Wind and solar do require land, just as coal, oil and natural gas did, but the acreage is larger – there’s no getting around it.  “Not every project can be no-impact,” he said. So backlash against new power plants is “a normal human reaction.” Local obstructions sometimes take the form of outright bans or moratoriums. But other rules also block green power: burdensome limits on size, height or locations. Some places put caps on total size or implement complex rules that prevent solar from replacing specially designated areas such as “prime farmland.”   These limits can mean wind or solar farms are allowed in theory but may be impossible to build in reality.  USA TODAY’s analysis considered a variety of limits to determine which ones were restrictive enough to effectively block new power projects. One example is a “setback” requirement for wind turbines. The larger the setback – a mandatory distance from a neighboring property line or structure – the larger the plot of land required for each turbine and the fewer that can be built. “Every year we’re seeing restrictions that are more severe,” said Matt Eisenson, senior fellow at Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law. “You now have counties in Nebraska that have 3-mile setbacks for wind turbines, so if you have a square plot of land, you would need 36 square miles to site a single wind turbine.” Solar farms might be allowed but subject to size restrictions that make them impractical. For example, in Virginia, 14 counties have set maximums on either the percentage of land or the number of acres that can be covered in solar panels, significantly restricting the size and number of possible projects. Other jurisdictions create shadow bans of sorts. Projects might not technically be banned, but officials simply reject all green energy plans on a case-by-case basis.  USA TODAY’s analysis began with data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law and then built on it with more than a year’s worth of tracking federal data, local government filings and media reports from across the country. The methodology and conclusions were vetted by an expert panel.  Earlier research from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory found local ordinances through 2021 were responsible for about a 13% reduction in wind capacity and a 2% reduction in solar capacity across the nation. That research likely underestimates the current effects, because of the large number of new impediments USA TODAY found from 2022 and 2023. USA TODAY’s findings were supported by research published in late January by the Department of Energy’s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Energy developers reported one-third of the wind and solar siting applications they had submitted in the past five years were canceled, while about half were delayed for six months or more. Zoning issues and community opposition were two of the top reasons.  Developers told the researchers that opposition to wind and solar projects is becoming more prevalent and more expensive, adding they project this will get worse. “There are impacts,” said Anthony Lopez, a senior researcher in the Geospatial Data Science Group at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Strategic Energy Analysis Center. He tracks ordinances governing wind and solar power for the U.S. government and has published extensively on the topic. “Our models show that when we reduce our nation's wind and solar resources through measures like local ordinances, it could slow down the process of decarbonization and make it much more expensive,” he said. At the University of Michigan, Mills said that if the windiest and sunniest places say no to large wind turbines and solar farms, developers move on to the next windiest or sunniest places, and then the next – each time to an area that is less efficient and more expensive.  “Once you place these restrictions, what’s left is less optimal,” said Mills. “What is the cost that we’re willing to pay for social acceptance?”  The opposition to renewable energy isn't as simple as left vs. right, and it isn't always a matter of big business vs. small activists. There’s no one group fighting renewables – there are many, with a range of objections.  Former President Donald Trump often denigrates wind and solar power in his speeches. In December in New Hampshire, he said, falsely, that wind farms only last 10 years, that they kill “all the birds,” that solar energy isn’t powerful enough to run factories and that wind is 42 times more expensive than natural gas. There are several national think tanks and groups, many that receive fossil fuel funding, that have been putting out arguments, often false, opposing wind and solar power for years.  But sometimes, big utility companies that make money with fossil fuels are actually the same utilities seeking to build solar farms or wind turbines. And much of the opposition comes from local activists without obvious ties to national groups. USA TODAY visited communities in three states and viewed public meetings in half a dozen others to understand public sentiments for and against green energy proposals. The opposition sometimes leads to surprising arguments about property rights, in which some landowners invoke concepts like a claim to a \"viewshed\" – views they want free of wind turbines or solar panels. These opponents clash with others who champion a different view of private property rights, saying landowners should be free to build what they want. And while opponents say solar and wind farms destroy the agricultural way of life, farmers themselves are often the ones who want to build green power, saying they’re simply swapping out one crop that requires the sun – corn or soy – for another, electricity. For wind, turbines can easily be placed in working fields or rangeland. These arguments now create rifts in rural communities nationwide. From California to New York, proposals have drawn local opposition as virulent as any book-banning controversy, with county board meetings so tense local police and sheriffs deputies are sometimes called to keep things civil. In Ohio in December, an anonymously funded group held a catered town hall meeting in Knox County featuring speakers linked to fossil fuel and climate change denial organizations who made many unsupported claims. Representatives of the project were not allowed in. National renewable energy opposition points posted online are quickly taken up by people living near proposed projects who use them to fight what they see as a threat to their communities and way of life.  Attend a county zoning or commission meeting and there will most likely be conspiracy theories and wild accusations about the dangers of renewable energy and even questions about whether global warming truly exists – often the exact same arguments put forth by fossil fuel funded think tanks.  But as person after person comes to the podium, another theme develops. Often, the people say they don’t reject the need for renewable power. But whatever their arguments, one sentiment underlies them – sadness and sometimes anger as they contemplate what feels like a massive change in the place they live and love. “I wouldn’t say we’re against renewable energy, I would say we’re against it being forced upon us,” said Coedy Snyder, who lives about three miles from the proposed Oak Run solar farm in Madison County, Ohio. The proposed 6,000-acre, 800 megawatt power plant would generate enough energy for as many as 170,000 homes, and developers say it could provide $250 million in tax revenue over 35 years.  Snyder has lived on the same road his whole life, farming soybeans and corn with his father, grandfather and brother. “You live in the country, and you want to be away from all the hustle and bustle. I kind of look at it as if they’re sticking a warehouse or a factory here,” he said. He believes if we wait, renewable technology will get better and not be as disruptive. “I just think with the technology 10 years from now there’s going to be something new,” he said. That’s a common anti-renewable talking point, that the world can wait for new technology that will mean current efforts to curb carbon-pollution are unnecessary. Gary Teach and his wife, April, live next door to the proposed solar farm. They bought their home 20 years ago, specifically so they could live in the country, away from people and traffic. “It’s going to change our lifestyle and the landscape and everything around here,” he said. “It’s like a train that can’t be stopped, it doesn’t matter what the people want.” In the case of the Sun Run facility, that might still be true. But it won’t be for any other projects.  On Sept. 12, 2023, Madison County commissioners voted on a new resolution: All new large-scale wind and solar projects would be banned.  Those kinds of bans mean the U.S. is in danger of not making the shift away from greenhouse gas producing energy in time, said Cullen Howe, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.   “If it’s getting harder to build these things in the places they need to go, or they take longer or they’re more expensive, then we’re not going to meet these goals,” he said. “We can’t wait 10 years for this to fix itself – the urgency is real. We need to be going much, much faster than we are currently going.”",

        "onlytext": "Across America’s power grid, there’s a growing gap between what we need and what we’ll allow. As the planet warms and climate disasters grow more costly, the U.S. has set a target to reach 100% clean energy by 2035, a goal that depends on building large-scale solar and wind power. \n\nA nationwide analysis by USA TODAY shows local governments are banning green energy faster than they’re building it. \n\nAt least 15% of counties in the U.S. have effectively halted new utility-scale wind, solar, or both, USA TODAY found. These limits come through outright bans, moratoriums, construction impediments and other conditions that make green energy difficult to build.\n\nThe impediments come as a gigantic effort to build green energy also is underway. U.S. energy from commercial wind and solar is expected to hit 19% by 2025, and those sources are expected to surpass the amount of electricity made from coal this year.\n\nBut green energy must increase radically over the next 11 years to meet U.S. goals. And those projects are becoming harder to build.\n\nIn the past decade, about 180 counties got their first commercial wind-power projects. But in the same period, more than twice as many blocked wind development. And while solar power has found more broad acceptance, 2023 was the first year to see almost as many individual counties block new solar projects as the ones adding their first projects.\n\nThe result: Some of the areas with the nation's best sources of wind and solar power have now been boxed out.\n\nBecause large-scale solar and wind projects typically are built outside city limits, USA TODAY’s analysis focuses on restrictions by the county-level governments that have jurisdiction. In a few cases, such as Connecticut, Tennessee and Vermont, entire states have implemented near-statewide restrictions.\n\nWhile 15% of America’s counties might sound like a small portion, the trend has significant consequences, says Jeff Danielson, a former four-term Iowa state senator now with the Clean Grid Alliance. “It’s 15% of the most highly productive areas to develop wind and solar,” he said. “Our overall goals are going to be difficult to achieve if the answer is ‘No’ in county after county.” The country’s green-energy deadline now sits just 11 years away.\n\nBut even if politicians fail to meet that goal, another clock is ticking.\n\nLast year, 2023, was the warmest in recorded history, warmer than any other in 125,000 years.

Pulaski has been running for 3 1/2 years,\" reads a July 17 Facebook post. \"They have been replacing the generators in all the wind towers. There are 100 of them in this wind farm. So evidently the life span on the generators on these things is about 3 to 4 years.\" The post then disparages wind power, asserting that a \"huge\" amount of diesel fuel required for repairs and maintenance.   The post was shared 18,000 times in three weeks, but it is inaccurate and misleading. Like any technology, wind turbine generators are subject to manufacturing defects or other problems. However, they typically last much longer than three or four years, according to research and industry representatives.  Further, even when the fossil fuels required to manufacture, install, maintain and dispose of wind turbines are considered, wind power releases far less greenhouse gases per kilowatt-hour than burning fossil fuels for electricity. Finally, while the post doesn't name a specific wind farm, the photo accompanying the post shows turbines at the HillTopper wind farm just outside of Mt.

There is no evidence that wind turbine generators have a lifespan of only three or four years. Jason Meeks, site manager of HillTopper wind farm, told USA TODAY that generators are \"typically expected to last around 20 years.\"  According to an analysis conducted in 2012 and 2013, wind turbine generators have a failure rate of about three and a half percent per year for the first 13 years, Eric Lantz, wind analysis manager at National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY in an email.  Based on this failure rate, only 14 percent of generators would fail after four years. However, the industry has worked to improve the technology in the years since then. Fact check: Energy costs of wind turbine manufacturing recouped in months Based on information from industry representatives, Lantz believes generator failure rates are lower now than they were a decade ago. But National Renewable Energy Laboratory has not independently assessed more recent data, he said.  While the post claims that all the generators are in the process of being replaced, Meeks said that HillTopper has not replaced any generators in its three and a half years of operation.  Instead, 17 gearboxes had to be swapped out \"due to unforeseen and rare defects related to the equipment procured from a third-party manufacturer,\" he said. A gearbox is a device used to transform the relatively slow turbine blade rotation speeds into faster rotational speeds ideal for generator function. In addition to HillTopper, Enel Green Power operates the Whitney Hill wind farm outside of Mt. Pulaski, but this project has not required any major recent repairs, according to Meeks.   Fact check: Wind turbine blades can be recycled, but it rarely happens today Wind turbine company Vestas also operates a large wind farm about 15 miles east of Mt. Pulaski. Vestas spokesperson, Chelsea Sassara, told USA TODAY in an email that the company has not been replacing generators and that the turbine pictured in the social media post did not belong to Vestas. The post is correct that utilizing diesel-fueled vehicles to maintain wind turbines releases CO2. However, wind power still produces far less CO2 per kilowatt-hour than burning fossil fuels.  Fact check: Storm damaged a wind turbine in Texas, not a heat wave When manufacturing, construction, maintenance, operation and decommissioning are considered, wind releases about 11 grams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt-hour, according to the Department of Energy. Meanwhile, natural gas releases 465 grams per kilowatt-hour and coal produces 980 grams per kilowatt-hour. \"That makes coal’s carbon footprint almost 90 times larger than that of wind energy, and the footprint of natural gas more than 40 times larger,\" says the Department of Energy website. Based on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that wind turbine generators typically only last three to four years. According to 2013 data, only 14% of generators would be expected to fail after four years, and an expert says lifespans have likely increased since then. The wind farm shown in the social media post is not in the process of replacing all of its generators but recently replaced 17 gearboxes, according to the company that operates the farm.",

        "title": "Big Oil vs the World tells the 40 year story of how the oil industry delayed action on climate change\n",
        "text": " BBC three-part series features never-before-seen documents, exclusive interviews with industry players, and testimony from leading scientists, politicians and CEOs As the UK sees record-breaking temperatures and forest fires devastate major areas of Europe, climate change is dominating news headlines. Now, a new BBC series tells the story of how we got here, charting decades of failure to tackle climate change. Part of the award-winning This World series, Big Oil vs the World is a fascinating look at how oil giants fuelled climate change denial, despite warnings from their own scientists of the risks carbon emissions posed to the planet. Drawing on thousands of newly discovered documents, the series goes on to chart, in revelatory and forensic detail, how the oil industry then mounted a campaign to sow doubt about the science of climate change, the consequences of which we are living through today. Part One: Denial Based on a year of investigative research, part one of the series: Denial tells the story of what the fossil fuel industry knew about climate change more than four decades ago, unveiling a complex campaign of media spin and political lobbying to spread scepticism on climate change. Speaking in the film, former US Vice-President Al Gore describes the efforts of big oil companies to delay the response to climate change as “the most serious crime of the post-world war two era”. “I think it's the moral equivalent of a war crime… The consequences of what they've done are just almost unimaginable,” he said. In the programme, scientists who worked for the biggest oil company in the world, Exxon, reveal the warnings they sounded in the 1970s and early 1980s about how fossil fuels would cause climate change – with potentially catastrophic effects. Discussing Exxon’s failure to act over the years, Dr Ed Garvey, who joined Exxon’s climate science research team in 1978, says that the company was aware that continuing to burn fossil fuels would mean significant climate impacts in the future. “it's just squandered time, and we're going to pay for it,” he states. Former United States Senator Chuck Hagel, who in the late 1990s led the charge in the US Senate against America joining an international agreement to reduce emissions, now says that the oil industry lied and misled him. “It’s cost the country, and it cost the world,” he admits. ‘Denial’ features first-hand accounts from politicians and activists fighting for action on climate change, including former Vice President Al Gore, as well as PR executives, scientists and economists paid by the oil industry. Part Two: Doubt Part two, Doubt, charts how the oil industry’s campaign to block action against climate change continued into the new millennium, even as the science grew more certain. George W. Bush’s former environment chief Christine Todd Whitman explains how industry lobbyists and Vice President Dick Cheney persuaded Bush to reverse his campaign promise to cut emissions. “It really was a tragedy. I think if President Bush had gone forward with a cap on carbon, it would have made an enormous difference,” she states. Speaking for the first time on camera, a disaffected former ExxonMobil geoscientist and climate change specialist, Bill Heins, reflects on the disconnect between what the company’s scientists knew, and what the CEO Lee Raymond was saying publicly about climate change.The film also unravels the story of the Koch Brothers’ extraordinarily successful effort to block President Obama’s early efforts to pass climate change legislation, and subsequent campaign to reshape the Republican Party into one in which climate denialism became the mainstream position of the party. A lawyer who worked for Kochs through this period speaks on camera for the first time about the campaign, as does Steve Lonegan of the Koch-funded group Americans for Prosperity – who boasts that their effort “put an end to the whole climate change argument. Since then till now, it’s been a dead issue.” BP’s former CEO Lord Browne tells the story of how BP first broke with the rest of the oil industry in acknowledging the reality of human-caused climate change, and re-branding as ‘Beyond Petroleum’. Accused of greenwashing by both environmentalists and other oil majors, Lord Browne continues to defend his record – although acknowledges that BP’s push into renewables ultimately fell short. “Looking backwards over the last 25 years, we really have lost a quarter century in what we should have been doing,” Browne states. Part Three: Delay The third and final part of the series, Delay, follows the fossil fuel industry up to the present day, and examines recent efforts to hold Big Oil legally accountable for the climate crisis. Delving into the world of fracking, revealing how big oil companies courted the Obama administration by presenting natural gas as an environmentally-friendly alternative to oil and coal. Obama climate official Heather Zichal now acknowledges for the first time that the administration did not realise how the natural gas boom would only worsen the climate crisis. She says, “Did it turn out we had it wrong? Absolutely.” Former ExxonMobil engineer, Dar Lon Chang, speaks for the first time on camera alleging that as the company increased its natural gas operations, it was not sufficiently monitoring methane leaks that were contributing to climate change. “There wasn't much appetite for management to measure methane leakage because, if they found out there was a problem, they would have to do something about it,” he states. But the film also speaks with activist Sharon Wilson who has spent more than a decade documenting methane leaks at sites operated by ExxonMobil and other oil and gas companies. Still travelling across the US in 2022, collecting evidence of ongoing leaks, she says: “We can have a future, or we can have oil and gas, but we cannot have both.” The Kochs did not respond to requests for an interview or statement. ExxonMobil did not grant any interviews for the series, but told the BBC in a written statement that its ‘public statements about climate change are, and have always been, truthful, fact-based, transparent and consistent with the contemporary understanding of mainstream climate science.’ ExxonMobil said it’s been an industry leader in the effort to reduce methane emissions and has been using advanced technology to detect leaks. The company says the litigation is ‘baseless’ and ‘without merit’; and ‘there is no truth to the suggestion that ExxonMobil ever misled the public or policymakers about climate change.’ Big Oil vs the World: Denial airs on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer, 9pm, Thursday 21 July. Notes to Editors Big Oil vs the World is a Mongoose Pictures production for the BBC in association with FRONTLINE.

        "title": "Africa’s first carbon-removal plant stokes questions about responsible climate solutions\n",
        "text": " A greener and more equitable future — that’s the idea behind a first-of-its-kind plant to be built in Kenya that could remove up to 1 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The proposal to build a direct air capture plant, announced in September by Swiss company Climeworks and Kenya-based Great Carbon Valley, has been billed as a springboard for creating a new, green economy in Africa as the world is expected to invest trillions of dollars in climate-related investment in the coming years. Direct-air capture sucks in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it underground, a process that is relatively energy intensive. The technology has been criticized by some climate scientists who argue that the technology is a dangerous distraction from the only viable solution to climate change: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning en masse away from fossil fuels. Others say that direct air capture is a necessary part of a diverse effort to limit global warming. “The world is going to need to decarbonize,” said Bilha Ndirangu, CEO of Great Carbon Valley. “There will be different investments and innovations in decarbonization efforts. How do we make sure that some of those investments are happening in Africa?” The case for investing in Africa is heightened by the disproportionate impacts of climate change, such as extreme drought and flooding, on African nations that have contributed little to the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. Last month, discussions at the United Nations and the Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi focused on how to attract more capital to the continent — the world’s youngest continent, with 70% of sub-Saharan Africa under the age of 30. Calls for investment in Africa are tempered by watchdogs who say foreign investment in the global South can be harmful if investors from the global North prioritize profit over the safety and rights of local populations. “There’s a real need for safeguards on where these projects are taking place,” said Ugbaad Kosar, the director of environmental justice at Carbon180, a climate nonprofit that advocates for equitable carbon removal. “And once that’s decided, it’s important to track how the resources, benefits and risks are being distributed among the companies and vulnerable populations.” Carbon removal companies such as Climeworks create units of carbon dioxide removed by their plants and companies can buy those units to offset their carbon emissions. With carbon removal, companies that continue to use fossil fuels can claim to be carbon-neutral because they purchased offsets created by some carbon removal plants. Climeworks said it only works with companies that plan to reduce emissions over time, using carbon removal as just one tool in that process. “All direct air capture does is help fossil fuel companies pretend they’re taking climate action while they continue to drill for oil,” Jonathan Foley, a climate scientist and founder of Project Drawdown, a nonprofit climate group, said. “Trading a few seconds of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions to give oil and gas companies a fig leaf is not a good bargain.” The plant, projected to be completed by 2028, will be built in the Great Rift Valley, an intercontinental depression rich in deep basalt formations that extends across Kenya from Tanzania and onward to Ethiopia. Ndirangu said that the project is an opportunity for Kenya to tackle the climate crisis while creating jobs and expanding the renewable energy grid.  Kenya has a relatively small energy grid that relies mostly on renewable energy. The country is rich in geothermal, solar and wind potential — but that renewable energy potential is untapped, said Carlijn Nouwen, co-founder of the nonprofit Climate Action Platform for Africa.  Many energy companies see little incentive to invest in Kenya’s energy infrastructure, but the energy-intensive Climeworks project could help attract investment in the grid and in turn benefit Kenyan citizens, Nouwen said — though she cautioned that Kenyan policymakers would need to enact policies to ensure the new energy reaches citizens. Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò, a professor of philosophy specializing in climate justice at Georgetown University, said he was skeptical that the project would benefit Kenyans over protecting the companies’ bottom lines.  “The investment coming in is to set up carbon removal that allows corporations in rich countries to dump their carbon pollution in the global South,” Táíwò said. “That’s not the kind of investment that inspires confidence in our progress on climate justice.”  Whether the technology is helpful or harmful, most experts agree that direct air capture is limited by massive price tags, heavy energy requirements and lack of scalability. Globally, 27 direct air capture plants remove 100,000 metric tons of CO₂ annually — a tiny fraction of the 36.8 billion metric tons of CO₂ pumped into the atmosphere by human activities in 2022.  Some say investing in direct air capture technology is pointless. “We don’t have an infinite amount of renewable energy,” said Mark Jacobson, a professor of environmental engineering at Stanford University. “If it’s being used for direct air capture, it’s not being used for something else. And right now, all our renewable energy is needed to replace fossil fuels.”  Julie Gosalvez, chief marketing officer of Climeworks, said judging the potential of a technology based on its current efficiency is not right, adding that the company plans to bring their net carbon removal into the billions of metric tons over the next few decades.  Gosalvez added that about 90% of the climate solution is cutting carbon emissions by transitioning from fossil fuels, but emphasized that some carbon removal is needed.  Many global climate leaders agree. In its most recent report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that all pathways to keeping global warming below 1.5 C include carbon dioxide removal.",

        "onlytext": "A greener and more equitable future — that’s the idea behind a first-of-its-kind plant to be built in Kenya that could remove up to 1 million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year. The proposal to build a direct air capture plant, announced in September by Swiss company Climeworks and Kenya-based Great Carbon Valley, has been billed as a springboard for creating a new, green economy in Africa as the world is expected to invest trillions of dollars in climate-related investment in the coming years. Direct-air capture sucks in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and stores it underground, a process that is relatively energy intensive. The technology has been criticized by some climate scientists who argue that the technology is a dangerous distraction from the only viable solution to climate change: Cutting greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning en masse away from fossil fuels. Others say that direct air capture is a necessary part of a diverse effort to limit global warming.\n\n“The world is going to need to decarbonize,” said Bilha Ndirangu, CEO of Great Carbon Valley. “There will be different investments and innovations in decarbonization efforts.

As part of a large-scale approach to fulfill this goal, there's one area of focus that sticks out: cows.  In March, the government unveiled its Net Zero Growth Plan, an initiative to limit reliance on fossil fuels – the burning of which significantly influences global temperature rise. One of the pathways to seeing this through is a focus on agricultural emissions, the country said, with officials adding in their plan that they are expecting \"high efficacy methane suppressing products\" to enter the market in 2025 to help. Such products, they said, would be introduced in a \"phased approach.\"  Agriculture and other land-use emissions make up about 11% of the U.K.'s net greenhouse gas emissions, including international aviation and shipping, officials said.  \"Livestock (particularly cattle) currently make up the largest share of these emissions,\" the Net Zero Growth Plan says.  Last year, environmental data company GHGSat captured methane emissions on satellites as they were being released by cows. They recorded five emissions in California's Joaquin Valley and found that if the amount of methane in those emissions were sustained for a year, it would result in 5,116 tonnes of gas, \"enough to power 15,402 homes.\" Experts say these flatulent emissions coming from cattle's bodily processes are mostly from burps.  U.K. officials put out a call in August for agriculture experts to provide information on how animal feed products could reduce methane emissions, such as \"methane production inhibitors, seaweeds, essential oils, organic acids, probiotics, and antimicrobials.\" More than 200 people responded to the call, including NGOs, farmers and businesses, and a summary of those results will be made public later this year.  Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the U.K.'s National Farmers' Union, told The Guardian that the suppressants being encouraged by officials \"could be useful.\"  \"I don't think we know enough yet about the impact they will have on the efficiency of the diet,\" he said, \"but it's something that we have to investigate to try and reduce methane emissions.\" Richard Waite, senior researcher at the World Resources Institute, said that while the suppressants could help reduce emissions from cow burps, they \"won't fix all the climate and other issue issues related to food systems.\"  Some consider it a \"techno fix,\" he said, similar to things like LED lightbulbs, electric vehicles and meat alternatives.

        "title": "The majority of Americans support climate reforms. Why won't Congress deliver?\n",
        "text": "The Inflation Reduction Act was hailed as “the most significant climate action in U.S. history” and provided nearly $400 billion for climate solutions. Congress passed the legislation in 2022 strictly along party lines, with no Republicans voting in favor.  In 2023, Democrats voted for pro-environmental legislation more than 90% of the time. Republicans voted for pro-environmental legislation less than 5% of the time, according to voting data collected by the League of Conservation Voters.  Answer a handful of questions from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication's Climate Change in the American Mind survey to see how your thoughts compare to your neighbor's. And yet, public opinion polling shows support for climate policies in conservative districts. According to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, about two-thirds of Americans are “worried” about climate change. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans support funding research into renewable energy, and 3 out of 4 support regulating carbon emissions. Two-thirds believe Congress should do more to address climate change.  Even in Jack County, Texas, where Donald Trump received 90% of the vote in 2020, 58% support regulating carbon emissions. That’s the lowest of any U.S. county.  So why is there such a disconnect between the American public and Congress?  Marc Arnauch, a third-generation farmer from Colorado, once didn't believe humans could change the climate. \"Earlier in my farming career, I was a naysayer that man couldn't possibly change the climate,\" he said.  But after years of watching nighttime temperatures rise and rainfall patterns shift, Arnauch couldn't deny the impact climate change was having on his crops.  In Arnauch's congressional district, two-thirds are worried about climate change, 79% support funding research into renewable energy and 73% support regulating carbon emissions.  Still, when election season comes around, climate isn't his top concern. He plans to vote for Rep. Lauren Boebert, even though she's been an outspoken opponent of climate policies, famously dismissing the issue by claiming, \"climate change occurs four times a year,\" referring to the seasons.  For Arnauch, other issues -- like his farm, family and the local economy, which relies heavily on farming and fracking -- take priority.  Arnauch story isn't unique. Lifelong Republican Larry Howe from Texas also finds himself at odds with his party on climate change, even as he agrees on many other issues.  Yale's polling data shows about 64% are worried about climate change in Texas, but Howe doesn't feel like his opinions on climate change align with his party.  At a recent town hall, Howe confronted his congressman, Rep. Pat Fallon, asking whether he would support climate education. Fallon instead urged caution, warning against \"climate alarmism.\"  Texas party leaders, like Dallas GOP Chairman Allen West, have echoed these sentiments, pushing back against \"extreme solutions\" they believe could limit personal freedoms.  But Howe said he will be taking climate into account on election day.  \"If you want my vote, you got to step up on climate and prioritize the issue,\" Howe said. \"If you're not willing to act on something with so much evidence behind it, how can I trust you on other issues?\"  Tony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, this disconnect between climate change and politics is widespread. \"We see pretty much across the board, at all levels of government, that government officials dramatically underestimate the level of support from their own constituents,\" Leiserowitz said. More Yale polling data found global warming ranked 19th among 28 issues listed in deciding a presidential candidate. It was ranked higher among Democratic voters and lower among Republican voters. Republican voters ranked the economy and inflation as the top two issues. \"There's a huge difference between voter preferences and voter priorities. And, you know, politicians have limited time and limited money and a limited ability to communicate with voters,\" said Nathaniel Stinnett, the founder and director of the Environmental Voter Project. In California, a state that typically leads the way in environmental laws and regulations, some local officials are cautious about changing too much too fast. Surprisingly some Democratic lawmakers are voting against environmental legislation, despite widespread public support for climate action. California Assemblymember Blanca Rubio said her votes reflect the financial realities her constituents face, not climate denial. \"Not every community can afford whatever policy we pass,\" Rubio said, pointing to the state's clean car regulations, which bans the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035. Experts warn that the state may not have the infrastructure to support the shift. \"A lot of times, we vote on bills based on hopes and dreams,\" Rubio said. Jobs are also a key issue. While clean energy jobs now make up more than half of California's energy workforce, fossil fuel jobs pay, on average, 50% more due to stronger unions. State Sen. Melissa Hurtado, who represents the state's largest oil-producing region, supports reducing emissions but stresses the need to protect local jobs. \"We have to think about what's going to keep our economy going and keep people employed,\" Hurtado said. While California Democrats may feel some climate policies are hurting their constituents, across the country many districts are seeing millions of dollars in investment and new jobs because of climate policy. This is especially true in conservative congressional districts where all representatives voted against the Inflation Reduction Act. Nearly two-thirds of the projects, more than two-thirds of the jobs and more than 80% of the money invested in projects taking advantage of the legislation's tax credits have been in Republican-represented congressional districts, according to data collected by E2, which has tracked project announcements since the bill's passing. Additionally, almost 3.5 million Americans worked in clean energy by the end of 2023 according to an analysis of federal data by E2. Clean energy jobs represented more than half of all new energy jobs in 2023. Georgia Rep. Buddy Carter, a Republican who represents a coastal district particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme storms like Hurricane Debby, voted against the act.  His district, however, is gaining 4,500 new green jobs and $3.5 billion in investments from the legislation. Carter said that his opposition stemmed from a provision in the IRA that lowers the cost of prescription drugs.  Still, Carter insists he aligns with his constituents' views.  \"I represent the entire coast of Georgia, and we love our environment,\" he said.  Yet, he has voted against environmental measures 96% of the time, according to the League of Conservation Voters, even as 53% of his district's residents express concern about climate change. Carter, the vice-chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus, which includes more than 80 Republicans who acknowledge climate change but all voted against the IRA, expressed uncertainty about its causes. \"I'm not a scientist in that realm, so I don't know what it could be, but I suspect it could be just natural phenomena,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not one of those who subscribes to the theory that if we don't fix it by the day after tomorrow, we're all going to fry. But I do believe we should address it.\" Another reason for the disconnect between voters and elected officials when it comes to climate change is the oil and gas industry. It spent $72 million on federal lobbying in the first half of 2024 alone, as the EPA introduced some of its toughest regulations to reduce fossil fuel emissions. This spending is on track to surpass the $133 million spent in 2023.  \"There's the existence of a very powerful lobby, mostly the fossil fuel industry, that is absolutely fighting tooth and nail to try to maintain their hold over our energy system,\" said Yale's Tony Leiserowitz. Research from Harvard University revealed that ExxonMobil accurately predicted climate change in the 1970s but never shared its findings. Today, Exxon leads the oil and gas lobbying efforts, ranking among the top 20 lobbyists across all industries, having spent $300 million since 1998. The industry has also donated more than $400 million to congressional campaigns since 1998, with about 80% of that going to Republican members.  \"These older companies are holding onto the past because it benefits their profits. They've had massive influence on politics, from the local to national level,\" Leiserowitz explained. Nathaniel Stinnett, from the Environmental Voter Project, said his organization focuses on \"finding people who care deeply about climate in the environment, who don't vote, and then turning them into better voters,\" Stinnett said.  This strategy has the potential to influence election outcomes. The Environmental Voter Project identified significant numbers of climate voters in key battleground states: 250,000 in Pennsylvania, 230,000 in Arizona and 490,000 in Georgia. Given the narrow margins in these states during the 2020 election, these voters could be decisive.  Researchers at the University of Colorado studied the 2016 and 2020 elections and found that 77% of voters - including moderates - consider climate change \"somewhat\" or \"very\" important supported Democrats. In 2020, these voters overwhelmingly backed Biden.  The researchers also found that climate change opinions boosted Biden's popular vote by 3%, enough to give him the edge over Trump in the 2020 election.  \"We know the policies needed to tackle the climate crisis. We know the technologies that should be adopted more quickly. We understand how utilities and energy consumption must change. The answers are there, but what often stands in the way is a lack of political will for politicians to enact these solutions,\" Stinnett said. ",

        "onlytext": "Climate change is a deeply polarizing issue within Congress. The Inflation Reduction Act was hailed as “the most significant climate action in U.S. history” and provided nearly $400 billion for climate solutions. Congress passed the legislation in 2022 strictly along party lines, with no Republicans voting in favor.  In 2023, Democrats voted for pro-environmental legislation more than 90% of the time. Republicans voted for pro-environmental legislation less than 5% of the time, according to voting data collected by the League of Conservation Voters.\n\nAnd yet, public opinion polling shows support for climate policies in conservative districts. According to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, about two-thirds of Americans are “worried” about climate change. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans support funding research into renewable energy, and 3 out of 4 support regulating carbon emissions. Two-thirds believe Congress should do more to address climate change.\n\nEven in Jack County, Texas, where Donald Trump received 90% of the vote in 2020, 58% support regulating carbon emissions. That’s the lowest of any U.S. county.\n\nSo why is there such a disconnect between the American public and Congress?\n\nMarc Arnauch, a third-generation farmer from Colorado, once didn't believe humans could change the climate. \"Earlier in my farming career, I was a naysayer that man couldn't possibly change the climate,\" he said.\n\nBut after years of watching nighttime temperatures rise and rainfall patterns shift, Arnauch couldn't deny the impact climate change was having on his crops.\n\nIn Arnauch's congressional district, two-thirds are worried about climate change, 79% support funding research into renewable energy and 73% support regulating carbon emissions.\n\nStill, when election season comes around, climate isn't his top concern. He plans to vote for Rep. Lauren Boebert, even though she's been an outspoken opponent of climate policies, famously dismissing the issue by claiming, \"climate change occurs four times a year,\" referring to the seasons.\n\nFor Arnauch, other issues -- like his farm, family and the local economy, which relies heavily on farming and fracking -- take priority.\n\nArnauch story isn't unique. Lifelong Republican Larry Howe from Texas also finds himself at odds with his party on climate change, even as he agrees on many other issues.\n\nYale's polling data shows about 64% are worried about climate change in Texas, but Howe doesn't feel like his opinions on climate change align with his party.\n\nAt a recent town hall, Howe confronted his congressman, Rep. Pat Fallon, asking whether he would support climate education. Fallon instead urged caution, warning against \"climate alarmism.\"\n\nTexas party leaders, like Dallas GOP Chairman Allen West, have echoed these sentiments, pushing back against \"extreme solutions\" they believe could limit personal freedoms.\n\nBut Howe said he will be taking climate into account on election day.\n\n\"If you want my vote, you got to step up on climate and prioritize the issue,\" Howe said. \"If you're not willing to act on something with so much evidence behind it, how can I trust you on other issues?\"\n\nTony Leiserowitz, the director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, this disconnect between climate change and politics is widespread. \"We see pretty much across the board, at all levels of government, that government officials dramatically underestimate the level of support from their own constituents,\" Leiserowitz said.\n\nMore Yale polling data found global warming ranked 19th among 28 issues listed in deciding a presidential candidate. It was ranked higher among Democratic voters and lower among Republican voters. Republican voters ranked the economy and inflation as the top two issues.\n\n\"There's a huge difference between voter preferences and voter priorities. And, you know, politicians have limited time and limited money and a limited ability to communicate with voters,\" said Nathaniel Stinnett, the founder and director of the Environmental Voter Project.\n\nIn California, a state that typically leads the way in environmental laws and regulations, some local officials are cautious about changing too much too fast.\n\nSurprisingly some Democratic lawmakers are voting against environmental legislation, despite widespread public support for climate action.\n\nCalifornia Assemblymember Blanca Rubio said her votes reflect the financial realities her constituents face, not climate denial. \"Not every community can afford whatever policy we pass,\" Rubio said, pointing to the state's clean car regulations, which bans the sale of new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.\n\nExperts warn that the state may not have the infrastructure to support the shift.\n\n\"A lot of times, we vote on bills based on hopes and dreams,\" Rubio said.\n\nJobs are also a key issue. While clean energy jobs now make up more than half of California's energy workforce, fossil fuel jobs pay, on average, 50% more due to stronger unions.\n\nState Sen. Melissa Hurtado, who represents the state's largest oil-producing region, supports reducing emissions but stresses the need to protect local jobs.\n\n\"We have to think about what's going to keep our economy going and keep people employed,\" Hurtado said.\n\nWhile California Democrats may feel some climate policies are hurting their constituents, across the country many districts are seeing millions of dollars in investment and new jobs because of climate policy.\n\nThis is especially true in conservative congressional districts where all representatives voted against the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nNearly two-thirds of the projects, more than two-thirds of the jobs and more than 80% of the money invested in projects taking advantage of the legislation's tax credits have been in Republican-represented congressional districts, according to data collected by E2, which has tracked project announcements since the bill's passing.\n\nAdditionally, almost 3.5 million Americans worked in clean energy by the end of 2023 according to an analysis of federal data by E2.\n\nClean energy jobs represented more than half of all new energy jobs in 2023.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Buddy Carter, a Republican who represents a coastal district particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts such as sea-level rise and extreme storms like Hurricane Debby, voted against the act.\n\nHis district, however, is gaining 4,500 new green jobs and $3.5 billion in investments from the legislation.\n\nCarter said that his opposition stemmed from a provision in the IRA that lowers the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nStill, Carter insists he aligns with his constituents' views.\n\n\"I represent the entire coast of Georgia, and we love our environment,\" he said.\n\nYet, he has voted against environmental measures 96% of the time, according to the League of Conservation Voters, even as 53% of his district's residents express concern about climate change.\n\nCarter, the vice-chair of the Conservative Climate Caucus, which includes more than 80 Republicans who acknowledge climate change but all voted against the IRA, expressed uncertainty about its causes.\n\n\"I'm not a scientist in that realm, so I don't know what it could be, but I suspect it could be just natural phenomena,\" he said, adding, \"I'm not one of those who subscribes to the theory that if we don't fix it by the day after tomorrow, we're all going to fry. But I do believe we should address it.\"\n\nAnother reason for the disconnect between voters and elected officials when it comes to climate change is the oil and gas industry.\n\nIt spent $72 million on federal lobbying in the first half of 2024 alone, as the EPA introduced some of its toughest regulations to reduce fossil fuel emissions.\n\nThis spending is on track to surpass the $133 million spent in 2023.\n\n\"There's the existence of a very powerful lobby, mostly the fossil fuel industry, that is absolutely fighting tooth and nail to try to maintain their hold over our energy system,\" said Yale's Tony Leiserowitz.\n\nResearch from Harvard University revealed that ExxonMobil accurately predicted climate change in the 1970s but never shared its findings.\n\nToday, Exxon leads the oil and gas lobbying efforts, ranking among the top 20 lobbyists across all industries, having spent $300 million since 1998.\n\nThe industry has also donated more than $400 million to congressional campaigns since 1998, with about 80% of that going to Republican members.\n\n\"These older companies are holding onto the past because it benefits their profits. They've had massive influence on politics, from the local to national level,\" Leiserowitz explained.\n\nNathaniel Stinnett, from the Environmental Voter Project, said his organization focuses on \"finding people who care deeply about climate in the environment, who don't vote, and then turning them into better voters,\" Stinnett said.\n\nThis strategy has the potential to influence election outcomes.\n\nThe Environmental Voter Project identified significant numbers of climate voters in key battleground states: 250,000 in Pennsylvania, 230,000 in Arizona and 490,000 in Georgia.\n\nGiven the narrow margins in these states during the 2020 election, these voters could be decisive.\n\nResearchers at the University of Colorado studied the 2016 and 2020 elections and found that 77% of voters - including moderates - consider climate change \"somewhat\" or \"very\" important supported Democrats.\n\nIn 2020, these voters overwhelmingly backed Biden.\n\nThe researchers also found that climate change opinions boosted Biden's popular vote by 3%, enough to give him the edge over Trump in the 2020 election.\n\n\"We know the policies needed to tackle the climate crisis.

        "text": "How we grow food, consume it and waste it may play a big role in whether the world can avert a climate catastrophe, environmentalists and climate change analysts say. One big obstacle to changing the most damaging practices is that many of them are in fact encouraged and financially incentivized by countries — including the U.S. — possibly pushing us faster toward a world that's too dangerously warm. \"If we do everything right — if we reduce energy-related emissions [and] transportation-related emissions as much as we all need, and we don't address emissions from agriculture, we are still not going to avoid a climate catastrophe,\" said Scott Faber, senior vice president for government affairs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. The global food system — the growing, processing, transporting, distributing, consumption and disposal of food — makes up a third of greenhouse gas emissions every year. From cutting down trees for grazing cattle, to food waste in landfills, each stage of the food system creates greenhouse gases: a study published in March estimated that emissions from food production and waste alone could push global temperatures up by as much as 1.1 degrees Celsius (1.98 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of the century.  Methane is the second biggest greenhouse gas producer after carbon dioxide, and it's 25 times as powerful as CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Overall, high-methane foods are on track to make up more than 80% of food-related warming by 2100.  Livestock and agriculture are big methane producers — particularly cattle and rice. Manure and gas from cows is rich in methane, as are rice paddies, which emit the gas after they're flooded.  In the U.S., perhaps the most influential factor in agriculture policy affecting climate change is the farm bill, a massive, contentious measure that sets agriculture policies and regulations. It's passed by Congress every five years and is up for renewal this year.  The Environmental Working Group (EWG) published an analysis of U.S. agriculture spending from 2017-2020, a period during which the environmental quality incentives program of the farm bill provided more than $3.6 billion of funding to farmer. But EWG found that just 23% of incentive payments \"were for practices that mitigate climate change,\" according to the Agriculture Department's own list of \"climate-smart practices and enhancements.\" Some of those climate-smart practices include converting manure into organic fertilizer, improving soil health by increasing plant diversity and minimizing soil disturbance.  But implementing new and climate-friendly practices may be costly and adversely affect yield, cutting into farmers' bottom lines and making their crops or herds less attractive to investors and buyers. That reality, according to the World Economic Forum, has resulted in a cycle in the U.S. that rewards \"the systems that are least regenerative, emit the most greenhouse gases, and result in the most land degradation.\" These damaging systems, the World Economic Forum said, \"are the most likely to have access to capital.\" The EWG analysis found that the majority of environmental quality incentives program practices funded by the farm bill were for structures, equipment or facilities that were not even on the department's \"climate-smart\" list, and further some of the items receiving the most funding, like waste storage facilities, which are used for manure, actually increase methane emissions, a point that has been acknowledged by the Agriculture Department. The department has a list of climate-friendly alternatives for managing cattle waste, among them, the use of microbes to anaerobically digest manure or composting, but all of these approaches come with attendant costs or labor. Globally, leaders have agreed to dramatically decrease agriculture sector emissions. In 2021, 111 countries, making up 45% of global methane emissions, signed an agreement to reduce methane emissions 30% by 2030, and 145 countries signed on to reverse deforestation — which is mostly caused by cattle ranching — by 2030.  In 2015,196 parties adopted the international Paris Agreement to keep global average temperatures from warming more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) as compared to pre-Industrial times. But since then, average global temperatures have already increased by at least 1.1 degrees Celsius; meaning, emissions related to our food system alone would push warming past the agreement's ceiling. \"When people think about climate the focus usually snaps to fossil fuels, renewable energy, and that makes sense because it's the leading driver [of emissions], but food is this super underappreciated part of it. We eat three times a day, so it's something that we can actually do something about,\" said Richard Waite, senior research associate of the World Resources Institute's food and climate programs.  The role of the global food system in producing greenhouse gas emissions has not been fully recognized by much of the world. Only a third of the 194 countries that signed the Paris Agreement reference food-system mitigation measures in their climate goals.  There have been climate-focused food system bills passed in Washington outside of the farm bill. In January, President Joe Biden signed the Food Donation Improvement Act, which promised to reduce food waste and insecurity. But the bill, Faber said, is just one example of congressional action that is too \"incremental.\"  Amanda Little, a food systems expert at Vanderbilt University agrees that more action is required beyond the Food Donation Improvement Act, but she praised the legislation in a Bloomberg opinion piece, as an important step toward resolving \"the gross contradiction between food excess and food scarcity in America.\" She pointed out that the new law will make it much easier for businesses, schools, farms and markets to donate their large surpluses of food directly to communities that need it by relieving them of liabilities related to food quality or spoilage. Previously, Little points out, they were required to make their food donations indirectly — to food banks that might be far away — and the food bank would then redistribute the food, a practice that in many cases was so impractical that it was just easier to throw away the extra food, instead of dealing with the logistics of donating it. The U.S., historically the world's largest emitter, does not mention curbing food waste in its latest emissions targets, even though nearly 40% of all food is wasted here. The U.S. should be leading the way on this issue, says Pete Pearson, of the World Wildlife Fund: \"We've got to have food loss and waste linked to our climate goals, period.\" And environmentalists worry that change is not happening fast enough, says Waite. He said that in some cases, mitigation measures need to be moving \"five to six times\" faster than current trends in order to meet global climate goals. Last year, the World Resources Institute published a study that examined the world's progress in meeting climate goals. In the food and agriculture sector, WRI found that ruminant meat productivity trends — that is, the meat of cattle, sheep and goats — were \"off track\" and greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production were moving in the \"wrong direction.\" Meat consumption is on the rise across the globe. As more wealth is created in emerging economies, such as China and Brazil, more meat is eaten, and the U.S. consumes more meat than any other country.  For years, studies and media reports have encouraged more plant-heavy diets and less red meat, arguing the shift could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A study published in Nature found that if diets globally were limited to one serving of red meat per week and all other animal protein to two servings per day, global warming due to food consumption would decrease by 0.19 °C by the end of the century.",

        "text": "The Senate on Thursday approved an effort to overturn an Environmental Protection Agency rule tied to the Clean Air Act and designed to limit seven of the most hazardous air pollutants that are emitted by heavy industry. The 52-46 party-line vote marked the first time in the 55-year history of the Clean Air Act that Congress has moved to weaken the power of the landmark environmental law. Senate Republicans utilized the Congressional Review Act to overturn the regulation, which was passed by the Biden administration in 2024. The joint resolution now goes to the Republican-led House, where it also expected to pass. The rule tied to the Clean Air Act was finalized last year to close a loophole that required all \"major\" sources of seven hazardous air pollutants to reduce their emissions by the maximum achievable amount, a policy called \"Once in, Always In.\" The rule requires that industrial facilities — often chemical plants, oil refineries, and other industrial factories classified as \"major\" sources of toxic air pollution — always maintain strict pollution controls. Even if they comply and limit those pollution levels, those facilities would always be labeled \"major\" sources under the rule. The Trump Administration had killed the rule in President Trump's first term, but the EPA, under former President Joe Biden, finalized and updated it last September. The environmental advocacy group Earthjustice has said that the rule forced 1,800 facilities across the country to tighten air pollution controls to comply with the law. The seven pollutants in question are: Several Republican lawmakers have been attempting to revoke the rule. Republican Sen. John Curtis of Utah introduced the resolution which passed Thursday. Curtis had argued that the rule disincentivized companies to deploy new technology to reduce pollution. \"The rule put forward under the former administration shut the door on progress,\" Curtis said in a statement after the resolution's passage. \"It told companies that no matter how much they invest to reduce harmful emissions, they would still be punished with permanent red tape. That's not good science, it's not good governance, and it certainly isn't good for the environment. My resolution restores a common-sense incentive: if you clean up, you get credit for it.\" Several environmental groups, however, blasted the move. \"Today, I worry for children's health more than ever before,\" Melody Reis, director of federal policy for Moms Clean Air Force, said in a statement to CBS News. \"Just now Senate Republicans voted to hand a couple of thousand of the nation's largest industrial polluters an easy way to release toxic air pollutants linked to cancer, birth defects, and brain damage. They voted to allow chemical manufacturers, pesticide makers, refineries and other facilities to turn off their pollution controls for the most insidious air pollutants known to humankind — chemicals such as dioxins, mercury, and PCBs. This will put our children, and all of us, at grave risk. It is a shameful, and completely unnecessary move.\"   Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, which is made up of former EPA staffers, said in his own statement, \"Congress should be strengthening EPA's ability to protect the public from mercury, benzene, and other dangerous emissions, not stripping away rules that hold polluters accountable.\" The vote marks a major victory for the fossil fuel and petrochemical industries, which had lobbied against the \"Once in, Always In\" rule for some time. The National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group, sent a letter to Mr. Trump after his inauguration calling the rule \"burdensome,\" and listing it as one of several environmental regulations that are \"strangling our economy\" and should be reversed. Since January, the Trump administration has undertaken a series of efforts to weaken the EPA through deregulation and staffing reductions. In an interview with \"Face the Nation\" last week, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin argued the rollbacks won't have adverse impacts on health or the environment.",

        "title": "Global pollution kills 9 million people each year, study finds",
        "text": "A new study blames pollution of all types for 9 million deaths a year globally, with the death toll attributed to dirty air from cars, trucks and industry rising 55% since 2000. That increase is offset by fewer pollution deaths from primitive indoor stoves and water contaminated with human and animal waste, so overall pollution deaths in 2019 are about the same as 2015. The United States is the only fully industrialized country in the top 10 nations for total pollution deaths, ranking 7th with 142,883 deaths blamed on pollution in 2019, sandwiched between Bangladesh and Ethiopia, according to a new study in the journal The Lancet Planetary Health.  Tuesday's pre-pandemic study is based on calculations derived from the Global Burden of Disease database and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle. India and China lead the world in pollution deaths with nearly 2.4 million and almost 2.2 million deaths a year, but the two nations also have the world's largest populations. When deaths are put on a per population rate, the United States ranks 31st from the bottom at 43.6 pollution deaths per 100,000. Chad and the Central African Republic rank the highest with rates at about 300 pollution deaths per 100,000, more than half of them due to tainted water, while Brunei, Qatar and Iceland have the lowest pollution death rates ranging from 15 to 23. The global average is 117 pollution deaths per 100,000 people. Pollution kills about the same number of people a year around the world as cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke combined, the study said. \"Nine million deaths is a lot of deaths,\" said Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program and Global Pollution Observatory at Boston College. \"The bad news is that it's not decreasing,\" Landrigan said. \"We're making gains in the easy stuff and we're seeing the more difficult stuff, which is the ambient (outdoor industrial) air pollution and the chemical pollution, still going up.\" It doesn't have to be this way, researchers said. \"They are preventable deaths. Each and every one of them is a death that is unnecessary,\" said Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Public Health, who wasn't part of the study. She said the calculations made sense and, if anything, the study was conservative about what it attributed to pollution — the real death toll is likely higher. The certificates for these deaths don't say pollution. They list heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, other lung issues and diabetes that are \"tightly correlated\" with pollution by numerous epidemiological studies, Landrigan said. To then put these together with actual deaths, researchers look at the number of deaths by cause, exposure to pollution weighted for various factors, and then complicated exposure response calculations derived by large epidemiological studies based on thousands of people over decades of study, he said. It's the same way scientists can say cigarettes cause cancer and heart disease deaths. \"That cannon of information constitutes causality,\" Landrigan said. \"That's how we do it.\" Five outside experts in public health and air pollution, including Goldman, told The Associated Press the study follows mainstream scientific thought. Dr. Renee Salas, an emergency room doctor and Harvard professor who wasn't part of the study, said \"the American Heart Association determined over a decade ago that exposure to (tiny pollution particles) like that generated from the burning of fossil fuels is causal for heart disease and death.\" \"While people focus on decreasing their blood pressure and cholesterol, few recognize that the removal of air pollution is an important prescription to improve their heart health,\" Salas said. Three-quarters of the overall pollution deaths came from air pollution and the overwhelming part of that is \"a combination of pollution from stationary sources like coal-fired power plants and steel mills on one hand and mobile sources like cars, trucks and buses. And it's just a big global problem,\" said Landrigan, a public health physician. \"And it's getting worse around the world as countries develop and cities grow.\" In New Delhi, India, air pollution peaks in the winter months and last year the city saw just two days when the air wasn't considered polluted. It was the first time in four years that the city experienced a clean air day during the winter months. That air pollution remains the leading cause of death in South Asia reaffirms what is already known, but the increase in these deaths means that toxic emissions from vehicles and energy generation is increasing, said Anumita Roychowdhury, a director at the advocacy group Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. \"This data is a reminder of what is going wrong but also that it is an opportunity to fix it,\" Roychowdhury said. Pollution deaths are soaring in the poorest areas, experts said. \"This problem is worst in areas of the world where population is most dense (e.g. Asia) and where financial and government resources to address the pollution problem are limited and stretched thin to address a host of challenges including health care availability and diet as well as pollution,\" said Dan Greenbaum, president of the Health Effects Institute, who wasn't part of the study. In 2000, industrial air pollution killed about 2.9 million people a year globally. By 2015 it was up to 4.2 million and in 2019 it was 4.5 million, the study said. Toss in household air pollution, mostly from inefficient primitive stoves, and air pollution killed 6.7 million people in 2019, the study found. Lead pollution — some from lead additive which has been banned from gasoline in every country in the world and also from old paint, recycling batteries and other manufacturing — kills 900,000 people a year, while water pollution is responsible for 1.4 million deaths a year. Occupational health pollution adds another 870,000 deaths, the study said. In the United States, about 20,000 people a year die from lead pollution-induced hypertension, heart disease and kidney disease, mostly as occupational hazards, Landrigan said. Lead and asbestos are America's big chemical occupational hazards, and they kill about 65,000 people a year from pollution, he said. The study said the number of air pollution deaths in the United States in 2019 was 60,229, far more than deaths on American roads, which hit a 16-year peak of nearly 43,000 last year. Modern types of pollution are rising in most countries, especially developing ones, but fell from 2000 to 2019 in the United States, the European Union and Ethiopia. Ethiopia's numbers can't quite be explained and may be a reporting issue, said study co-author Richard Fuller, founder of the Global Alliance on Health and Pollution and president of Pure Earth, a non-profit that works on pollution clean-up programs in about a dozen countries. The study authors came up with eight recommendations to reduce pollution deaths, highlighting the need for better monitoring, better reporting and stronger government systems regulating industry and cars. \"We absolutely know how to solve each one of those problems,\" Fuller said. \"What's missing is political will.\"",

We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Greenhouse gas emissions might have already peaked. Now they need to fall — fast. Earth is coming out of the hottest year on record, amplifying the destruction from hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, and drought. The oceans remain alarmingly warm, triggering the fourth global coral bleaching event in history. Concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere have reached levels not seen on this planet for millions of years, while humanity’s demand for the fossil fuels that produce this pollution is the highest it has ever been.  Yet at the same time, the world may be closer than ever to turning a corner in the effort to corral climate change.  Last year, more solar panels were installed in China — the world’s largest carbon emitter — than the US has installed in its entire history. More electric vehicles were sold worldwide than ever. Energy efficiency is improving. Dozens of countries are widening the gap between their economic growth and their greenhouse gas emissions. And governments stepped up their ambitions to curb their impact on the climate, particularly when it comes to potent greenhouse gases like methane. If these trends continue, global emissions may actually start to decline. Climate Analytics, a think tank, published a report last November that raised the intriguing possibility that the worst of our impact on the climate might be behind us.  “We find there is a 70% chance that emissions start falling in 2024 if current clean technology growth trends continue and some progress is made to cut non-CO2 emissions,” authors wrote. “This would make 2023 the year of peak emissions.” “It was actually a result that surprised us as well,” said Neil Grant, a climate and energy analyst at Climate Analytics and a co-author of the report. “It’s rare in the climate space that you get good news like this.” The inertia behind this trend toward lower emissions is so immense that even politics can only slow it down, not stop it. Many of the worst-case climate scenarios imagined in past decades are now much less likely.  The United States, the world’s second largest greenhouse gas emitter, has already climbed down from its peak in 2005 and is descending further. In March, Carbon Brief conducted an analysis of how US greenhouse gas emissions would fare under a second Trump or a second Biden administration.  They found that Trump’s stated goals of boosting fossil fuel development and scrapping climate policies would increase US emissions by 4 billion metric tons by 2030. But even under Trump, US emissions are likely to slide downward.  This is a clear sign that efforts to limit climate change are having a durable impact.  However, four months into 2024, it seems unlikely that the world has reached the top of the mountain just yet. Fossil fuel demand is still poised to rise further in part because of more economic growth in developing countries. Technologies like artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies are raising overall energy demand as well.  Still, that it’s possible at all to conceive of bending the curve in the near term after more than a century of relentless growth shows that there’s a radical change underway in the relationship between energy, prosperity, and pollution — that standards of living can go up even as emissions from coal, oil, and gas go down.  Greenhouse gases are not a runaway rocket, but a massive, slow-turning cargo ship. It took decades of technology development, years of global bickering, and billions of dollars to wrench its rudder in the right direction, and it’s unlikely to change course fast enough to meet the most ambitious climate change targets.  But once underway, it will be hard to stop.  Since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, greenhouse gas emissions have risen in tandem with wealth and an expanding population. Since the 1990s and the 2000s, that direct link has been separated in at least 30 countries, including the US, Singapore, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Their economies have grown while their impact on the climate has shrunk per person. In the past decade, the rate of global carbon dioxide pollution has held fairly level or risen slowly even as the global economy and population has grown by wider margins. Worldwide per capita emissions have also held steady over the past decade.  “We can be fairly confident that we’ve flattened the curve,” said Michael Lazarus, a senior scientist at SEI US, an environmental think tank, who was not involved in the Climate Analytics study. Still, this means that humanity is adding to the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — and doing so at close to its fastest pace ever.  It’s good that this pace is at least not accelerating, but the plateau implies a world that will continue to get warmer. To halt rising temperatures, humans will have to stop emitting greenhouse gases, zeroing their net output, and even start withdrawing the carbon previously emitted. The world thus needs another drastic downward turn in its emissions trajectory to limit climate change. “I wouldn’t get out any balloons or fireworks over flattening emissions,” Lazarus said.  Then there’s the clock. In order to meet the Paris climate agreement target of limiting warming this century to less than 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) on average above pre-industrial temperatures, the world must slash carbon dioxide emissions in half by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. That means power generators, trucks, aircraft, farms, construction sites, home appliances, and manufacturing plants all over the world will have to rapidly clean up.  The current round of international climate commitments puts the planet on track to warm by 5.4°F (3°C) by the end of the century. That’s a world in which the likelihood of a major heat wave in a given year would more than double compared to 2.7°F of warming, where extreme rainfall events would almost double, and more than one in 10 people would face threats from sea level rise.  “That puts us in this race between the really limited time left to bend the emissions curve and start that project towards zero, but we are also seeing this sort of huge growth, an acceleration in clean technology deployment,” Grant said. “And so we wanted to see which of these factors is winning the race at the moment and where we are at.”  Grant and his team mapped out three scenarios. The first is a baseline based on forecasts from the International Energy Agency on how current climate policies and commitments would play out. It shows that fossil fuel-related carbon dioxide emissions would reach a peak this year, but emissions of other heat-trapping gases like methane and hydrofluorocarbons would keep rising, so overall greenhouse gas emissions would level off.  The second scenario, dubbed “low effort,” builds on the first, but also assumes that countries will begin to fulfill their promises under agreements like the Global Methane Pledge to cut methane pollution 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030 and the Kigali Amendment to phase out HFCs. Under this pathway, total global emissions reach their apex in 2025.  The third scenario imagines a world where clean technology — renewable energy, electric vehicles, energy efficiency — continues gaining ground at current rates, outstripping energy demand growth and displacing coal, oil, and natural gas. That would mean greenhouse gases would have already peaked in 2023 and are now on a long, sustained decline.  The stories look different when you zoom in to individual countries, however. While overall emissions are poised to decline, some developing countries will continue to see their output grow while wealthier countries make bigger cuts.  As noted, the US has already climbed down from its peak. China expects to see its emissions curve change directions by 2025. India, the world’s third largest greenhouse gas emitter, may see its emissions grow until 2045.  All three of these pathways anticipate some sort of peak in global emissions before the end of the decade, illustrating that the world has many of the tools it needs to address climate change and that a lot of work in deploying clean energy and cleaning up the biggest polluters is already in progress.  There will still be year-to-year variations from phenomena like El Niño that can raise electricity demand during heat waves or shocks like pandemics that reduce travel or conflicts that force countries to change their energy priorities. But according to the report, the overall trend over decades is still downward.  To be clear, the Carbon Analytics study is one of the more optimistic projections out there, but it’s not that far off from what other groups have found. In its own analysis, the International Energy Agency reports that global carbon dioxide emissions “are set to peak this decade.” The consulting firm McKinsey anticipates that greenhouse gases will begin to decline before 2030, also finding that 2023 may have been the apogee.  Global emissions could just as easily shoot back up if governments and companies give up on their goals Within the energy sector, Ember, a think tank, found that emissions might have peaked in 2022. Research firm Rystad Energy expects that fossil fuel emissions will reach their pinnacle in 2025.  Bending the curve still requires even more deliberate, thoughtful efforts to address climate change — policies to limit emissions, deploying clean energy, doing more with less, and innovation. Conversely, global emissions could just as easily shoot back up if governments and companies give up on their goals.  “Peaking is absolutely not a guarantee,” Grant said. And if greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, even at a slower rate, Earth will continue heating up. It means more polar ice will melt, lifting sea levels along every ocean, increasing storm surges and floods during cyclones. It means more dangerous heat waves. It means more parts of the world will be unlivable.  There are some other caveats to consider. One is that it’s tricky to simply get a full tally of humanity’s total impact on the climate. Scientists can measure carbon dioxide concentrations in the sky, but it’s tougher to trace where those molecules came from.  Burning fossil fuels is the dominant way humans add carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. Since they’re closely tracked commercial commodities, there are robust estimates for their contributions to climate change and how they change over time.  But humans are also degrading natural carbon-absorbing ecosystems like mangrove forests. Losing carbon sinks increases the net amount of carbon dioxide in the air. Altering how we use land, like clearing forests for farms, also shifts the balance of carbon. These changes can have further knock-on effects for the environment, and ecosystems like tropical rainforests could reach tipping points where they undergo irreversible, self-propagating shifts that limit how much carbon they can absorb.  All this makes it hard to nail down a specific time frame for when emissions will peak and what the consequences will be.  There’s also the thorny business of figuring out who is accountable for which emissions. Fossil fuels are traded across borders, and it’s not always clear whose ledger high-polluting sectors like international aviation and shipping should fall on. Depending on the methodology, these gray areas can lead to double-counting or under-counting.  “It’s very difficult to get a complete picture, and even if we get the little bits and pieces, there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Luca Lo Re, climate and energy analyst at the IEA.  Even with these uncertainties, it’s clear that the scale of the course correction needed to meet climate goals is immense.  According to the Climate Analytics report, to meet the 2030 targets for cutting emissions, the world will need to stop deforestation, stop any new fossil fuel development, double energy efficiency, and triple renewable energy.  Another way to illustrate the enormity of this task is the Covid-19 pandemic. The world experienced a sudden drop in global emissions as travel shut down, businesses closed, people stayed home, and economies shrank. Carbon dioxide output has now rebounded to an even higher level. Reducing emissions on an even larger scale without increasing suffering — in fact, improving welfare for more people — will require not just clean technology but careful policy. Seeing emissions level off or decline in many parts of the world as economies have grown in recent decades outside of the pandemic is an important validation that the efforts to limit climate change are having their intended effect. “Emissions need to decrease for the right reasons,” Lo Re said. “It is reasonable to believe our efforts are working.” The mounting challenge is that energy demand is poised to grow. Even though many countries have decoupled their emissions from their GDPs, those emissions are still growing. Many governments are also contending with higher interest rates, making it harder to finance new clean energy development just as the world needs a massive buildout of solar panels, wind turbines, and transmission lines.  And peaking emissions isn’t enough: They have to fall. Fast.  The longer it takes to reach the apex, the steeper the drop-off needed on the other side in order to meet climate goals. Right now, the world is poised to walk down a gentle sloping hill of greenhouse gas emissions instead of the plummeting roller coaster required to limit warming this century to less than 2.7°F/1.5°C. It’s increasingly unlikely that this goal is achievable.  Finally, the ultimate validation of peak greenhouse emissions and a sustained decline can only be determined with hindsight. “We can’t know if we peaked in 2023 until we get to 2030,” said Lazarus. The world may be closer than ever to bending the curve on greenhouse gas emissions downward, but those final few degrees of inflection may be the hardest.  The next few years will shape the warming trajectory for much of the rest of the century, but obstacles ranging from political turmoil to international conflict to higher interest rates could slow progress against climate change just as decarbonization needs to accelerate.  “We should be humble,” Grant said. “The future is yet unwritten and is in our hands.” Understand the world with a daily explainer, plus the most compelling stories of the day.

        "onlytext": "Greenhouse gas emissions might have already peaked. Now they need to fall — fast. Earth is coming out of the hottest year on record, amplifying the destruction from hurricanes, wildfires, heat waves, and drought. The oceans remain alarmingly warm, triggering the fourth global coral bleaching event in history. Concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere have reached levels not seen on this planet for millions of years, while humanity’s demand for the fossil fuels that produce this pollution is the highest it has ever been.\n\nYet at the same time, the world may be closer than ever to turning a corner in the effort to corral climate change. Last year, more solar panels were installed in China — the world’s largest carbon emitter — than the US has installed in its entire history. More electric vehicles were sold worldwide than ever.

        "title": "Fact check: Solar panels better than cornfields for carbon emissions",
        "text": "As solar power proliferates across the U.S., some developers have sought out farmlands for their flat terrain, roadways and electric infrastructure. However, there has been pushback in some rural areas by residents who view large solar arrays as an industrial threat to area scenery and livelihoods.  In November, a post began spreading on Facebook claiming that replacing cornfields with solar panels may actually exacerbate climate change. “Corn sequesters 36,000 lb of carbon per acre/yr. An acre of grass draws down 920 lbs of carbon. So an acre of solar panels where corn once grew will be a net loss of 35,080 lbs of carbon taken from the atmosphere,” reads the Nov. 21 post, which cites a \"Michigan State study.\" “Wanna cause global warming?\" it continues. \"Solar panels on farmland is a good place to start.”  The post was shared more than 300 times within a day. But the claim is wrong – both misquoting and misunderstanding an article on the subject. Special access for subscribers! Click here to sign up for our fact-check text chat Corn cannot permanently remove  the amount of carbon claimed in the post. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by growing corn plants but is quickly released back to the atmosphere after the corn is harvested. The claim also ignores the benefits of solar panels in mitigating climate change. USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment. The Facebook post appears to reference a 2007 article written by Kurt Thelen, a professor in the Michigan State University Department of Plant, Soil and Microbial Sciences. But the post misstates Thelen's claims. While the post says 36,000 pounds of carbon are sequestered by corn, Thelen wrote an acre of corn could absorb roughly 36,000 pounds of carbon dioxide in a year. This distinction is important because 36,000 pounds of carbon dioxide only contains about 9,800 pounds of carbon.  Either way, Thelen told USA TODAY he never said corn would permanently remove large amounts of carbon. His article spells this out.  “Of course, much of that carbon is eventually returned to the atmosphere as the corn crop residue decomposes or the grain is consumed as feed or burned as biofuel,” Thelen wrote.   There is a key distinction between carbon that is temporarily absorbed and carbon that is sequestered  – meaning it is removed long-term from the atmosphere by being placed in a stable repository. For instance, an undisturbed forest can sequester carbon for a long time in the trunks of trees and in the soil. “There's a big difference between assimilating carbon and sequestering it,” Thelen said. “(That) might be where the misunderstanding is.” Fact check: Electric vehicles emit fewer emissions and are better for the environment In fact, corn production tends to result in a net addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, Jordan Macknick, an environmental analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY. \"Emissions come from the use of inorganic fertilizers, manure, phosphates, lime and diesel, as well as grain drying,\" he said in an email. Under specific soil conditions and optimal management practices, corn can technically sequester modest amounts of carbon in the soil for a time, according to Keith Paustian, a professor of soil and crop sciences at Colorado State University. However, eventually, the soil will reach \"equilibrium\" and no additional carbon will be sequestered.  \"Under most cases, agricultural land is a net greenhouse gas emitter at some level,\" he told USA TODAY, though he emphasized that low carbon agriculture was possible with the right management practices.  On the other hand, solar technology helps prevent carbon dioxide emissions from being released in the first place. It provides a substitute energy source for greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels.  Macknick said calculating the precise CO2 mitigation potential of one acre of solar panels is complicated.

        "onlytext": "As solar power proliferates across the U.S., some developers have sought out farmlands for their flat terrain, roadways and electric infrastructure. However, there has been pushback in some rural areas by residents who view large solar arrays as an industrial threat to area scenery and livelihoods.\n\nIn November, a post began spreading on Facebook claiming that replacing cornfields with solar panels may actually exacerbate climate change. “Corn sequesters 36,000 lb of carbon per acre/yr. An acre of grass draws down 920 lbs of carbon. So an acre of solar panels where corn once grew will be a net loss of 35,080 lbs of carbon taken from the atmosphere,” reads the Nov. 21 post, which cites a \"Michigan State study.\" “Wanna cause global warming?\" it continues. \"Solar panels on farmland is a good place to start.”\n\nThe post was shared more than 300 times within a day. But the claim is wrong – both misquoting and misunderstanding an article on the subject.\n\nCorn cannot permanently remove the amount of carbon claimed in the post. Carbon dioxide is absorbed by growing corn plants but is quickly released back to the atmosphere after the corn is harvested. The claim also ignores the benefits of solar panels in mitigating climate change.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment. The Facebook post appears to reference a 2007 article written by Kurt Thelen, a professor in the Michigan State University Department of Plant, Soil and Microbial Sciences. But the post misstates Thelen's claims. While the post says 36,000 pounds of carbon are sequestered by corn, Thelen wrote an acre of corn could absorb roughly 36,000 pounds of carbon dioxide in a year. This distinction is important because 36,000 pounds of carbon dioxide only contains about 9,800 pounds of carbon.\n\nEither way, Thelen told USA TODAY he never said corn would permanently remove large amounts of carbon. His article spells this out. “Of course, much of that carbon is eventually returned to the atmosphere as the corn crop residue decomposes or the grain is consumed as feed or burned as biofuel,” Thelen wrote.\n\nThere is a key distinction between carbon that is temporarily absorbed and carbon that is sequestered – meaning it is removed long-term from the atmosphere by being placed in a stable repository. For instance, an undisturbed forest can sequester carbon for a long time in the trunks of trees and in the soil. “There's a big difference between assimilating carbon and sequestering it,” Thelen said. “(That) might be where the misunderstanding is.”\n\nIn fact, corn production tends to result in a net addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, Jordan Macknick, an environmental analyst at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, told USA TODAY. \"Emissions come from the use of inorganic fertilizers, manure, phosphates, lime and diesel, as well as grain drying,\" he said in an email.\n\nUnder specific soil conditions and optimal management practices, corn can technically sequester modest amounts of carbon in the soil for a time, according to Keith Paustian, a professor of soil and crop sciences at Colorado State University. However, eventually, the soil will reach \"equilibrium\" and no additional carbon will be sequestered. \"Under most cases, agricultural land is a net greenhouse gas emitter at some level,\" he told USA TODAY, though he emphasized that low carbon agriculture was possible with the right management practices.\n\nOn the other hand, solar technology helps prevent carbon dioxide emissions from being released in the first place. It provides a substitute energy source for greenhouse gas-emitting fossil fuels.\n\nMacknick said calculating the precise CO2 mitigation potential of one acre of solar panels is complicated. Different regions of the U.S. have different weather patterns and rely on different proportions of natural gas, coal, nuclear and renewable energy. Each solar installation is unique, too. However, Macknick said 70 to 110 metric tons per acre per year is a conservative estimate for the amount of CO2 emissions solar technology can prevent. That estimate is based on solar power generation averages from Seattle and San Deigo, assuming a smaller-scale installation.\n\nMichele Boyd, program manager for the Department of Energy’s Solar Energy Technologies Office, calculated an even higher value based on a different set of estimates. She put the number at more than 300 metric tons per acre.\n\n\"These reductions would continue year after year,\" she said.\n\nBased on our research, we rate FALSE the claim that replacing cornfields with solar panels exacerbates climate change.

        "text": "A Dec. 10 Facebook post claims eligible homeowners can receive financial assistance from the government for switching to renewable energy. “Our government just released a new 2023 solar incentive program, and they’re literally paying homeowners $8500 to install these new solar panels,” reads the post, which goes on to describe the criteria for eligibility. More from the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team: The Department of Energy said the federal government has no such programs to fund solar panel installation and has warned the public about scams suggesting otherwise. Eligible homeowners can reduce solar panel installation costs through a federal tax credit, but the program does not guarantee $8,500 in savings. The link in the Facebook post directs users to a website that is unaffiliated with the federal government and does not mention the supposed $8,500 handout. The website asks users to enter their name, zip code and phone number to see if they qualify for the purported offer. The Department of Energy also said the claim is false.  “The U.S. government does not provide free solar panels,” said department spokesperson Samah Shaiq. “Consumers should be careful about offers that seem too good to be true and can contact the Federal Trade Commission to report scams.”  The department also warned about such claims in an April article on its website. It states the public should be cautious about websites that ask for personal information under the guise of verifying eligibility for a solar panel installation program or receiving a price quote.  Fact check: Government offers tax credits, not free solar panels Eligible homeowners can receive a 30% federal tax credit if they installed or will install solar panels between 2022 and 2032, which the Department of Energy said can reduce installation costs by more than $7,500 for an average system. Those potential savings would come in the form of reduced tax liability, not an upfront payment. There are also various loan programs and leases for solar energy systems, as well as state-level incentives in some places, according to the department.  Department of Agriculture spokesperson Allan Rodriguez also said the claim is “not related to any USDA program.”",

        "text": "The British Army is using solar panels made by companies claimed to have a \"very high\" exposure to forced labour in China, the BBC can reveal. The production of solar panels in the Xinjiang region has been linked to the alleged exploitation of Uyghur Muslims. The British Army is investing £200m in solar panels across four of its sites. The Ministry of Defence listed JA Solar, Trina and Qcells as the solar panel suppliers in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request. A report in July this year by the UK's Sheffield Hallam University flags the three companies as having \"very high\" exposure to production in Xinjiang. JA Solar and Qcells told the BBC they were taking action to make sure forced labour had no part in their supply chains, but Trina didn't reply to requests for comment. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: \"We have robust procedures in place that allow us to vet and routinely monitor all aspects of our supply chain which is kept under constant review.\" But Alan Crawford, one of the authors of the Sheffield Hallam report, said he had seen the list of companies obtained by the BBC and he believed his findings still stood.  As a chemical engineer with extensive experience of supplier identification, he said big solar firms were unlikely to buy components they knew for certain were the products of forced labour. But, he added, there was a \"lack of transparency\" in the supply chain, which led some firms to \"hide behind\" their \"anti-slavery declarations\". Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is facing calls to take a harder line against China and to end the UK's reliance on solar production from the country. Senior Conservative MP Alicia Kearns is urging the UK government to \"sanction and [impose] a ban on any solar company with links to Uyghur forced labour from operating in the UK\". The US has accused the Chinese government of arbitrarily detaining more than one million Uyghurs and other mostly Muslim minorities in Xinjiang prison camps. In state-sponsored programmes, detainees are forced to produce goods including polysilicon, a core ingredient in solar panels, according to the US Department of Labor. The Chinese government has always staunchly denied all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Ms Kearns, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, told the BBC there was \"an ever-growing mass of evidence linking the solar industry to the forced labour and genocide of the Uyghur people in China\". The MP said the UK Ministry of Defence's \"exposure via solar investments is indicative of the scale of the issue, which will only get worse as the UK continues to lag behind international partners in acting\". Solar power is huge source of renewable energy and one of the cornerstones of the international effort to curb climate-warming carbon emissions. China has dominated the market and, according to the International Energy Agency, the country's global share in all the manufacturing stages of solar panels exceeds 80%. It's a dilemma for the UK, which imports a large portion of its solar panels from China. The British Army's use of Chinese-made solar panels comes as no surprise to Yalkun Uluyol. An academic native of Xinjiang, Mr Uluyol has been researching the links between Chinese manufacturers and alleged forced labour in his home region. Mr Uluyol said his research found forced labour \"happens almost everywhere in every sector\". The evidence for this, he added, can be found in official Chinese records and the personal experiences of Uyghurs like members of his family. He said relatives - including his father - had been held in detention camps, with some \"taken away to work in facilities\". \"Green energy means respect for human rights and respect for the environment,\" Mr Uluyol said. \"Both are absent from the Uyghur region.\" Mr Uluyol's conclusions are shared by the US government, which has passed a law that requires companies to prove that goods imported from Xinjiang were not produced with forced labour. The US has been blocking shipments of solar energy components since passing the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act in 2021. Project Prometheus began in the same year, as allegations of forced labour in solar supply chains came into sharper focus. The fourth and final site - which is using solar panels made by JA Solar, a Chinese company - was due to open at Rock Barracks in Suffolk this year. Asked to comment on the Sheffield Hallam report, Michael Parr, a solar expert who works with Qcells, said there was \"no doubt that the broad assessment was pretty fair\". \"It's really challenging to do an airtight independent audit in China,\" said Mr Parr, the executive director of the Ultra Low Carbon Solar Alliance. \"It's difficult to get clear data from the companies. Most of the wafer supply comes from numerous companies and they often blend. Even companies who are buying polysilicon from the US and Europe are reliant on China.\" When told the British Army was using solar panels made by JA Solar, Trina and Qcells, Mr Parr said: \"Europe has been less attentive to the risk of forced labour in solar than the US\". He said he would \"differentiate\" between the three companies supplying panels for Project Prometheus. He said while Trina and JA Solar were Chinese manufacturers \"with the vast majority of their manufacturing\" in China, Qcells was a South Korean company that's \"done a lot of work on trying to clean up their supply chains\". In recent years, solar companies have taken steps to sever ties with Xinjiang. Some have diversified their production to cut out the region, while the solar industry has tried to improve its monitoring of supply chains. A spokesperson for JA Solar said the company was \"strongly committed to ensuring that our operations and supply chain are free from any form of forced labour\". \"JA Solar has due diligence mechanisms in place, reviews its suppliers and has several ongoing projects to further enhance the traceability of all JA Solar modules,\" it added. A spokesperson for Segen, which supplied JA Solar panels to Project Prometheus, said the company was \"committed to achieving a traceable supply chain and has processes in place\".  The spokesperson said the UK solar sector was \"driving best practice\" through a scheme to encourage common standards of production and oversight. Qcells said it took \"the forced labour issue very seriously, which is why we do everything we can to track and monitor our supply chain\". A spokesperson said Qcells had adopted a code of conduct that \"prohibits forced-labour made products in our supply chain and we terminate agreements if suppliers fail to comply\". Qcells had invested \"billions of dollars\" in \"an entirely American supply chain to produce polysilicon-based solar panels\", the spokesperson added.  Trina did not respond to requests for comment. Plans for a solar farm bigger than 130 football pitches near Newent have been rejected. Councillors say renewable power is needed to tackle climate change. An Essex MP and ex-Tory Home Secretary says the Labour government has \"abandoned\" the region. Plans for a 154-acre site in Haswell Plough are knocked back by Durham County Council. Building energy infrastructure has been a key policy for the government.",

        "title": "Carbon capture and \"dimming\" the sun: Climate geoengineering poses technical and ethical dilemmas\n",
        "text": "The climate crisis is arguably the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced, and to limit warming to manageable levels, time is our biggest opponent. While the transition from fossil fuels to cleaner renewable energy is now gaining steam, the pace is simply not fast enough to head off the harmful impacts that are already being felt throughout the world. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \"Special Report: Global Warming of 1.5ºC\" — the international community's benchmark guide to averting climate disaster — says to reach the goal of staying below 1.5ºC of warming requires \"rapid and far-reaching transitions\" in our energy, industrial and other systems that would be \"unprecedented in scale.\" In other words, the task is herculean.  So, many experts say drastic times call for drastic measures, arguing that technology like climate geoengineering should be part of the solution toolkit. Proponents say that while switching to renewable energy, driving electric vehicles and restoring forests can get us far, that's simply not enough. The IPCC agrees, and cites one specific type of geoengineering — carbon capture and sequestration — as a necessary part of the suite of solutions. While carbon capture — a process of trapping, compressing and then storing away harmful emissions to keep them out of the atmosphere — has its share of detractors, the climate community generally accepts that it will be necessary, though the extent to which it can and should be used is hotly debated.  But that debate pales in comparison to the controversy provoked by another proposed type of geoengineering known as Solar Radiation Management, in which humans would artificially dim the sun. That idea is loaded with compelling physical and ethical considerations which will be explored below. Since the Industrial Revolution, the burning of fossil fuels has released 1.6 trillion tons of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide (CO2) has increased by 50% — at a pace 100 times faster than it naturally should. As a result, our planet is now warming 10 times faster than it has in 65 million years. The scale and speed is unprecedented. Despite advances in clean energy like wind and solar, the world still gets 80% of its energy from fossil fuels. Because it is integrated into almost every nook and cranny of modern life, the challenge of eliminating carbon from our energy system is monumental. And even if humanity can significantly slow or even stop emitting carbon pollution, carbon dioxide will remain in the atmosphere for hundreds or even thousands of years. The only way to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations is to pull the carbon back out of the atmosphere.  In order to do that, there are natural solutions like forest restoration as well as technical solutions like carbon capture systems. A 2017 research paper, led by the Nature Conservancy, found that natural climate solutions like restoring forests, wetlands and grasslands can, in a best-case scenario, provide 37% of the CO2 mitigation needed to keep humanity below the upper goal (2ºC of warming) of the Paris Agreement. That's significant, but not enough.  Chad Frischmann, the senior director of research and technology at Project Drawdown, a climate solutions organization, prefers if society concentrates on developing ways to get nature to do the work.  \"Overall, these natural forms of 'carbon capture' are tried, true and cost effective. More importantly, they have a ton of cascading benefits to agricultural productivity, biodiversity, and the health of the planet,\" he said. But carbon capture specialists like Dr. Julio Friedmann, a global energy policy expert from Columbia University — known as @CarbonWrangler on Twitter — believe technological solutions should have a bigger role to play because even if we shift to clean energy there are certain industrial processes, like cement and steel making, that cannot easily be decarbonized. As is clear from his Twitter handle, Friedmann is bullish on carbon removal — not as a replacement for other solutions, but as a complement to them.  \"CO2 removal is one mitigation strategy. It is a mitigation strategy like efficiency, renewables, electric vehicles. It is just one of the many things that we will do,\" he said. \"But if we do everything we know how to do today there's always this fat residual 10 billion tons a year that we have no solutions for.\" Carbon capture — often referred to as CCUS, for carbon capture, utilization and storage — is an industrial process by which carbon dioxide is absorbed during power generation and industrial processes and stored away, typically underground, sometimes utilized for enhanced oil recovery or used in certain manufactured goods.  Globally, there are about 50 large-scale CCUS plants, including 10 currently operating in the U.S.  A less common but growing method is called direct air capture (DAC), in which carbon dioxide is sucked right out of the air through the use of large fans. There are currently only 15 DAC facilities worldwide which capture only 9,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year. Some larger facilities are planned. The Swiss company Climeworks is building a DAC plant in Iceland capable of capturing 4,000 tons, and the American petroleum giant Occidental plans a much more ambitious facility in the West Texas Permian Basin which it says will capture 1 million tons of CO2 a year. Collectively all these CCUS and DAC facilities have the capacity to capture about 40 million tons of carbon dioxide yearly. It sounds like a lot, until you consider that each year humans emit almost 40 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere —1,000 times more than we can capture — to say nothing about all the CO2 that is already up there as a result of the Industrial Revolution. To put it bluntly, critics say CCUS and DAC are not ready for prime-time and may never be. The processes are very expensive, they consume copious amounts of energy themselves — often, ironically, produced by burning fossil fuels — and their capacity is just a tiny fraction of what's needed. Frischmann said, \"They will never scale to the level necessary to offset fossil fuel emissions, and will take 20 years of 20% annual growth to even start making a dent in the atmosphere. Highly unlikely rate of growth.\" He's also concerned about the moral hazard of promoting carbon capture as a solution, because he says these \"false silver bullets\" mean emitters can keep emitting with the promise that technology will suck up all their pollution. \"Attention to them now allows fossil fuel companies, and their cronies, to continue business-as-usual with the promise of a Band-Aid that is not materializing anytime soon,\" Frischmann said. But Friedmann disagrees. He believes good policies can help carbon capture scale up quickly.  \"It's not a technology challenge, it's a finance challenge,\" he said. \"It's helpful to think about these things like solar in 2002. Solar electricity in 2002 was expensive, not mass produced. And then there was this set of policy and innovation pushes that really dropped the price and helped commercialization.\" He also feels that mopping up our mess is a moral responsibility.  \"If you accept that we should remove CO2 from the air and oceans, it is essentially a way of addressing prior wrongs. It's a way of the Global North announcing its intentions to clean up its mess and say we are going to do this so the Global South doesn't have to.\" Peter Kalmus (@ClimateHuman), a NASA climate scientist, says he supports the concept of carbon capture and thinks we should keep researching it, but he is \"extremely skeptical it will ever be possible or helpful.\" He thinks it should not be included in planning until we know it can be done at scale.  Kalmus puts it colorfully: \"I feel the IPCC stepped way out of bounds in normalizing it in greenhouse gas budgets and scenarios. They may as well have included genies, fairies, and pixies in their scenarios.\"  Kalmus shares a concern with many others in the climate community that focusing on carbon capture will distract us from the real work of getting off fossil fuels. He said, \"The most compelling 'con' to me is that it will be used by politicians, decision-makers, and the public to reduce the urgency and delay timescales for addressing what is surely the greatest emergency facing humanity.\" But clearly the two arguments are not mutually exclusive: carbon capture can both be used as a delay tactic and also be a necessary part of the solution.  President Biden's ambitious climate agenda aims to bolster the U.S. carbon capture capacity, not only to clean up the environment but also to create jobs. His $2 trillion infrastructure plan includes funding for carbon recapture plants. This is a rare area of agreement for Democrats and Republicans and may be a necessary inclusion to help garner support across the aisle. It's even won support from the United Mine Workers of America, which backed incentives for using carbon capture technology along with measures to protect jobs in coal country. If the idea of artificially dimming the sun to minimize global warming seems like science fiction, you wouldn't be alone in that opinion. It is certainly fraught with potential dangers and unknowns. But the concept is actually rather simple technologically, and relatively inexpensive. The challenges are not so much technical or financial, they are political and ethical. Proponents like Bill Gates say solar geoengineering could buy humanity time to transition over to renewable energy. Opponents argue there are a multitude of concerns about the potential consequences. Solar geoengineering proposals go by various names, including Solar Radiation Management (SRM) and Stratospheric Aerosol Intervention (SAI). The idea is to fly specialized planes into the stratosphere, more than 50,000 feet above Earth's surface, and unload small aerosol particles (like sulfates) which would block some of the sunlight from reaching the Earth. Because atmospheric winds are all connected, the suspended particles would circulate the globe. Less sun equals less heating. Theoretically, the amount of cooling could be controlled by managing the amount and distribution of aerosols the planes deliver. As long as the particles are up there, the cooling would continue. There is also a less talked-about option called Marine Cloud Brightening. It's somewhat similar in that particles are injected, but this time into clouds to make them brighter, whiter and more able to reflect sunlight back into space before it heats the Earth. Proposals suggest spraying sea salt aerosols from vessels into marine clouds. Those particles would act as condensation nuclei allowing more cloud droplets to form, blocking more sun. Here the impacts here would be more regional, not global.  Both types of solar geoengineering are explained below, in an illustration from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Scientists know SAI could lower temperatures because a natural version of it is on display for all to see and measure when big volcanoes, like Mout Pinatubo in the Philippines, erupt and spew sulfates high up into the stratosphere.  In 2001, Pinatubo injected about 15 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, where it formed a hazy layer of aerosol particles composed primarily of sulfuric acid droplets. This blocked enough sunlight to reduce the planet's temperature by 1ºF over the course of 1 to 2 years. \"The technical challenges for stratospheric aerosol geoengineering are not great, all that is needed is a new, high-altitude jet that could carry tons of material into the lower stratosphere, about 60,000 feet up,\" explains Peter Irvine, a professor of solar geoengineering at University College London.   Specialized planes would be needed because the air is much thinner at that high altitude. Irvine believes it's a cost-effective option to consider given the severity of the crisis facing the planet. \"Developing and running a fleet of such aircraft would cost a few billion dollars per year initially, which is small compared to the projected damages of climate change or to the costs of decarbonizing the economy,\" he said. A 2018 paper estimates the upfront cost for development of one such aircraft would be $2 to $3 billion, and maintaining a fleet of planes making 4,000 worldwide missions per year would cost around $2 to $2.5 billion per year over the first 15 years. Frischmann says it's the affordability that scares him. \"It is cheap, and this is scary. There are any number of billionaires, corporations or small states with the wealth to inject enough sulfate into the stratosphere to cause irreparable damage. Chilling thought,\" he said. The damage that might be caused by tampering with the atmosphere is debatable and unknown because there simply hasn't been much real-world research done. That's partly because any atmospheric modification, or even the consideration of it, is highly controversial.  A major concern among many climate scientists is the chance of unintended consequences from artificially cooling the Earth with aerosols. Could it cause floods in one nation and droughts in another? Will it weaken the ozone layer? Will it hurt species or ecosystems? Could it be used unilaterally as a weapon by one nation to inflict climate damage on another? Some of these hypotheticals may be more likely than others, but these are questions that can only be answered by research. Its ability to raise alarm was on display a few weeks ago. A very small research project called SCoPEx, by a group of Harvard researchers, which was scheduled for this summer, was just postponed until at least 2022. To illustrate how divisive the concept is, the team wasn't even spraying any aerosols — just testing equipment. Regardless, Swedish environmental organizations and the Indigenous Saami Council sent a letter demanding the project be canceled, calling the plan a real moral hazard and saying the technology entails risks of catastrophic consequences. The Harvard advisory committee put it on hold, pending further societal engagement. While Irvine is bullish on SIA's \"potential to reduce the risks of climate change if used as a complement to emissions cuts,\" he is quick to point out that a much better understanding is needed: \"We don't know enough about its potential, limits and risks to make recommendations on whether or not to deploy it. Research is needed to better understand its potential physical consequences, as well as to understand the broader social and political challenges it poses.\" In 2019, the U.S. government allotted $4 million for stratospheric monitoring and research efforts. The program includes assessments of solar climate interventions such as proposals to inject material into the stratosphere. A year ago, Irvine and Dr. David Keith, another well-known expert in solar geoengineering, published a paper looking into the effectiveness and potential side effects of SAI. In a geoengineering model study, the team found that halving warming with stratospheric aerosol geoengineering could potentially reduce key climate hazards and would have limited regional side effects. But a limited model study is not nearly enough to base these monumental decisions on. Recently, solar geoengineering supporters got a boost from a powerful scientific organization. Given the urgency of the risks posed by climate change, the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the U.S. government should cautiously pursue a research program for solar geoengineering, with funding in the $100 to $200 million range over 5 years.  But even if solar geoengineering worked to cool temperatures, it would do nothing for the problem of ocean acidification, because it does not address the root cause of the warming — the carbon dioxide which traps heat and dissolves in the ocean to make waters more acidic. For all these reasons, many in the climate community believe the cons outweigh the potential pros.  \"In short, do not try to fix a global, catastrophic problem with a Band-Aid that no one knows will work as intended, or knows what long-term unintended damage can be done to the planet,\" said Frischmann.  Kalmus sees the value in researching solar geoengineering, but says the fact that we are even contemplating it evokes visions of a dystopian future. He goes further by discussing what is likely the most risky aspect of SAI.  \"Solar geoengineering has an even darker aspect which is that the moment society stopped doing it, for whatever reason, there would be a rapid spike in global mean temperature, which is an extraordinarily dangerous prospect,\" he said.  In other words, if the world used SAI to hold down temperatures for 30 years, and then stopped, almost immediately temperatures would spike the whole 30 years worth of warming in a year or two — with possibly devastating consequences for ecosystems and species that could not immediately adapt. \"It is a last resort lever to be pulled under the most dire circumstances for life on the planet. There is not a scenario where I see this as needed,\" Frischmann urges. As an expert in solutions, he points instead to a more holistic set of changes we could make to energy use, industry, transportation, agriculture and other sectors that are supported by research.  Kalmus sees resorting to extreme geoengineering solutions as lazy and selfish.  \"Saying either 'we'll figure out and do carbon capture later this century' or 'we'll cool the planet with aerosols' is negligently irresponsible, and basically says, 'We old people can keep consuming and polluting, we'll force our kids to pay the price.' It's intergenerational genocide.\" ",

He goes further by discussing what is likely the most risky aspect of SAI.\n\n\"Solar geoengineering has an even darker aspect which is that the moment society stopped doing it, for whatever reason, there would be a rapid spike in global mean temperature, which is an extraordinarily dangerous prospect,\" he said.\n\nIn other words, if the world used SAI to hold down temperatures for 30 years, and then stopped, almost immediately temperatures would spike the whole 30 years worth of warming in a year or two — with possibly devastating consequences for ecosystems and species that could not immediately adapt.\n\n\"It is a last resort lever to be pulled under the most dire circumstances for life on the planet. There is not a scenario where I see this as needed,\" Frischmann urges.\n\nAs an expert in solutions, he points instead to a more holistic set of changes we could make to energy use, industry, transportation, agriculture and other sectors that are supported by research.\n\nKalmus sees resorting to extreme geoengineering solutions as lazy and selfish.\n\n\"Saying either 'we'll figure out and do carbon capture later this century' or 'we'll cool the planet with aerosols' is negligently irresponsible, and basically says, 'We old people can keep consuming and polluting, we'll force our kids to pay the price.' It's intergenerational genocide.\"",
